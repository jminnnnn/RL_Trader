Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   General        Our sales are derived from the retail sale of products at our stores. Internally, we look to a variety of indicators to evaluate our sales and gross profit performance, including, among others: same-store sales; sales per store; sales per selling square foot; percentage of total sales by department; shrink and department gross margins. We focus on increasing same-store sales, sales per selling square foot and sales per store through programs which provide greater customer service and better store-level execution, promotional activities and merchandising, as well as high sanitation standards. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we implemented the Initiative in all of our stores to increase same-store sales and profitability by enhancing the customers shopping experience. The Initiative is the first phase of our broader merchandising plan to increase same-store sales and profitability. In the longer term, we will focus on additional marketing and merchandising areas, including product placement and adjacencies, private label and enhanced use of the Pathmark Advantage Card.        Our operating expenses are primarily incurred from selling, general and administrative costs. Over 70% of these costs are for labor and labor-related benefits. Internally, we focus on a variety of indicators to evaluate our expense performance, including, among others: labor costs, including labor hours and hourly labor rates and labor-related expenses such as welfare costs, pension costs, payroll taxes and workers compensation costs. In fiscal 2005, we focused on controlling labor costs through a labor buyout initiative. Selling, general and administrative expenses other than labor and labor-related costs include occupancy expenses, supplies and customer accident claims, among others.        As has been our practice in the past, we will continue to evaluate the profitability, strategic positioning, impact of potential competition, and sales growth potential of all our stores on an ongoing basis. We may, from time to time, make decisions regarding acquisitions, closures, relocations or renovations in accordance with such evaluations. During fiscal 2005, we opened two new stores, one of which was a replacement for a closed store, closed four stores and completed eight store renovations. During fiscal 2006, we plan to complete 16 store renovations.   Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004        The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data (dollars in millions):          52 Weeks Ended         January 28, 2006       January 29, 2005         Amount         %         Amount         %     Sales              $  3,977.0           100.0    %    $  3,978.5           100.0    %                     Gross profit        $  1,130.7           28.4    %    $  1,132.4           28.5    %     Selling, general and administrative expenses          (1,040.9    )      (26.1    )      (984.9    )      (24.8    )     Depreciation and amortization          (90.8    )      (2.3    )      (89.4    )      (2.2    )     Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets                                (309.0    )      (7.8    )                     Operating loss          (1.0    )                 (250.9    )      (6.3    )     Interest expense, net          (64.7    )      (1.6    )      (67.0    )      (1.7    )                     Loss before income taxes          (65.7    )      (1.6    )      (317.9    )      (8.0    )     Income tax benefit          25.6           0.6           9.3           0.2                          Net loss        $    (40.1    )      (1.0    )%    $   (308.6    )      (7.8    )%                     16           Sales.  The following table sets forth data related to sales for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004:           52 Weeks Ended        January 28, 2006         January 29, 2005     Total sales decrease                       %          (0.3    )%     Same-store sales decrease          (0.8    )%      (0.8    )%     Sales per selling square foot        $  725         $    724              Sales in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were $3.98 billion. Sales in fiscal 2005 increased 1.2% from new stores, offset by a 0.8% decrease in same-store sales (stores open the entire year in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, including replacement stores and enlargements) and a 0.4% decrease from closed stores. We believe sales benefited from an increase in average order size, but continued to be negatively affected by a decrease in customer traffic. During fiscal 2005, we opened two new stores, one of which was a replacement for a closed store, closed four stores and completed eight store renovations. We operated 141 stores at the end of fiscal 2005 and 143 stores at the end of fiscal 2004.         Gross Profit.  Gross profit represents the difference between sales and cost of goods sold, which includes the costs of inventory sold and the related purchase and distribution costs, net of vendor allowances and rebates. Gross profit in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was $1.13 billion. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 28.4% in fiscal 2005 compared to 28.5% in fiscal 2004; the reduction in the gross profit percentage in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increased inventory shrink and logistic costs, offset by improved departmental mix. As a result of the Initiative, we incurred higher inventory shrink in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 of $10.3 million, as compared to the prior year, primarily in the perishable departments.         SG&A.  SG&A in fiscal 2005 was $1,040.9 million or 26.1% of sales compared to $984.9 million or 24.8% of sales in fiscal 2004, an increase of $56.0 million. SG&A in fiscal 2005 included: (1) a $14.6 million charge related to employee-related separation costs, comprised of (a) a $8.4 million charge related to a corporate headcount reduction program, (b) a $3.6 million charge related to a store labor buyout initiative, and (c) a $2.6 million charge related to separation agreements with two former executives, (2) a $4.7 million charge related to the Initiative, (3) a $1.2 million charge related to the amortization of stock-based compensation, and (4) a $1.1 million charge related to a review of strategic alternatives, which resulted in the Yucaipa investment. SG&A in fiscal 2004 was net of a $1.4 million credit to correct, on a cumulative basis, the accounting for our operating leases and long-term disability plan (See Note 29. Accounting Adjustments  Fiscal 2004) and a $1.5 million gain from the sale of real estate. The balance of the increase in SG&A in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to the following factors: (1) supply and utility expenses increased by 0.3% of sales, due to higher oil prices, (2) welfare, pension and medical expenses increased by 0.1% of sales, and (3) store labor expenses increased by 0.1% of sales, due to contractual increases.         Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets. Based on the evaluation of our goodwill and long-lived assets performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we concluded there was no impairment in fiscal 2005 compared to a non-cash impairment charge of $309.0 million in fiscal 2004.         Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization of $90.8 million in fiscal 2005 was $1.4 million higher than the $89.4 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the amortization of the first phase, completed in fiscal 2004, of a multi-year project to upgrade our merchandising system. Depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2004 included a charge of $2.0 million to correct, on a cumulative basis, the amortization of certain leasehold improvements (see Note 29. Accounting Adjustments  Fiscal 2004).         Operating Loss.  The operating loss was $1.0 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $250.9 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the operating loss in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charge of $309.0 million in fiscal 2004, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses in fiscal 2005.     17           Interest Expense, Net.  Interest expense was $64.7 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $67.0 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to lower debt and higher cash investments resulting from the Yucaipa investment. We used a portion of the net proceeds to pay down our Working Capital Facility borrowings and defease our mortgage borrowings, which resulted in a mortgage debt extinguishment charge of $2.8 million. Fiscal 2004 included a write-off of deferred financing costs of $1.7 million related to the refinancing of our previous credit agreement.         Income Tax Benefit.  The income tax benefit of $25.6 million in fiscal 2005 was based on an effective tax rate of 38.9% and the income tax benefit of $9.3 million in fiscal 2004 was based on an effective income tax rate of 42.0%. During fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, we made income tax payments of $3.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Refer to Note 20 of the consolidated financial statements for information related to our income taxes.         Summary of Operations.  The net loss in fiscal 2005 was $40.1 million compared to $308.6 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the net loss in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charge of $309.0 million in fiscal 2004 and higher SG&A expenses, lower interest expense and higher income tax benefits in fiscal 2005.   Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003        The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data (dollars in millions):          52 Weeks Ended         January 29, 2005       January 31, 2004         Amount         %         Amount         %      Sales              $  3,978.5           100.0    %    $  3,991.3           100.0    %                     Gross profit        $  1,132.4           28.5    %    $  1,138.7           28.5    %     Selling, general and administrative expenses          (984.9    )      (24.8    )      (953.9    )      (23.9    )     Depreciation and amortization          (89.4    )      (2.2    )      (84.0    )      (2.1    )     Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets          (309.0    )      (7.8    )                                           Operating earnings (loss)          (250.9    )      (6.3    )      100.8           2.5          Interest expense, net          (67.0    )      (1.7    )      (72.5    )      (1.8    )                     Earnings (loss) before income taxes          (317.9    )      (8.0    )      28.3           0.7          Income tax benefit (provision)          9.3           0.2           (11.8    )      (0.3    )                     Net earnings (loss)        $   (308.6    )      (7.8    )%    $     16.5           0.4    %                          Sales.  The following table sets forth data related to sales for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003:          52 Weeks Ended        January 29, 2005         January 31, 2004     Total sales increase (decrease)                (0.3    )%      1.4    %     Same-store sales increase (decrease)          (0.8    )%      1.2    %     Sales per selling square foot        $   724         $   734              Sales in fiscal 2004 were $3.98 billion compared to $3.99 billion in fiscal 2003, a decrease of 0.3%. The sales decrease in fiscal 2004 was due to a 0.8% decrease in same-store sales (stores open the entire year in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, including replacement stores and enlargements) and by a 0.6% decrease from closed stores, partially offset by a 1.1% increase from new stores. We believe sales in fiscal 2004 were affected by continuing weakness in consumer demand, which resulted in a decrease in our customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in our average order size. The change to an everyday low price concept in our health and beauty care category in February 2004 has not yet achieved the sales we expected, resulting in lower sales in this category, although our unit volume has increased. We operated 143 stores at the end of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.     18           Gross Profit.  Gross profit represents the difference between sales and cost of goods sold, which includes the costs of inventory sold and the related purchase and distribution costs, net of vendor allowances and rebates. Gross profit in fiscal 2004 was $1.13 billion or 28.5% of sales compared to $1.14 billion or 28.5% of sales for fiscal 2003. The decrease in gross profit dollars in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower sales. The gross profit margin in fiscal 2004 was impacted by the inability to pass on the full cost of increases in wholesale prices earlier in the fiscal year, offset by improved margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.         SG&A . SG&A in fiscal 2004 was $984.9 million or 24.8% of sales compared to $953.9 million or 23.9% of sales in fiscal 2003. SG&A in fiscal 2004 is net of a $1.4 million credit to correct, on a cumulative basis, the accounting for our operating leases and long-term disability plan (see Note 29. Accounting Adjustments  Fiscal 2004) and a $1.5 million gain from the disposition of real estate. SG&A in fiscal 2003 included a $13.7 million gain from the disposition of real estate related to the assignment of two real estate leases and a $8.1 million charge related to our store labor buyout initiative and corporate headcount reduction program, which was commenced and completed during the first six months of fiscal 2003 in order to reduce labor costs. Excluding the aforementioned items of $2.9 million and $5.6 million in fiscal 2004 and in fiscal 2003, respectively, SG&A in fiscal 2004 increased by $28.3 million, or 0.7% of sales, compared to fiscal 2003, primarily due to the following factors: (1) welfare, pension and medical expenses increased by 0.3% of sales, (2) store labor expenses increased by 0.2% of sales, due to the negative sales leverage, and (3) rent and real estate taxes increased by 0.1% of sales due to three new stores compared to fiscal 2003. The remaining increases were primarily due to professional fees associated with implementing the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as system expenses and costs related to our strategic alternative.         Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization of $89.4 million in fiscal 2004 was $5.4 million higher than the $84.0 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to an increase of $30.0 million in capital expenditures, including technology investment, in fiscal 2004, and a charge to depreciation and amortization expense of $2.0 million in fiscal 2004 related to leasehold improvements.         Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets. Based on our valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $309.0 million. The goodwill impairment of $293.8 million, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, represents the write down of the carrying value of our goodwill to its implied fair value and is due to our declining operating performance in fiscal 2004 and the reduced valuation multiples in the retail grocery industry. Such negative factors are reflected in our stock price and market capitalization. The long-lived assets impairment of $15.2 million represents the write downs of under-performing stores to their fair market values.         Operating Earnings (Loss).  The operating loss was $250.9 million in fiscal 2004 compared to operating earnings of $100.8 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in operating earnings in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the non-cash goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charge of $309.0 million and higher SG&A expenses.         Interest Expense, Net.  Interest expense was $67.0 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $72.5 million in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in fiscal 2004 included a write off of deferred financing costs of $1.7 million related to the refinancing of our previous credit agreement. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 included a derivative settlement charge of $3.7 million related to the termination and settlement of $150 million of our interest rate zero-cost collar and the write off of deferred financing costs of $2.6 million resulting from the repayment of $171 million of our Term Loan primarily from proceeds of additional borrowings of $150 million under the Senior Subordinated Notes. Excluding these items, interest expense in fiscal 2004 decreased by $0.9 million compared to fiscal 2003. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower interest rates.         Income Tax Benefit (Provision).  The income tax benefit in fiscal 2004 was $9.3 million compared to an income tax provision in fiscal 2003 of $11.8 million. During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, we made income tax payments of $3.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively.    19           Summary of Operations.  The net loss in fiscal 2004 was $308.6 million compared to net earnings of $16.5 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in net earnings in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charge of $309.0 million in fiscal 2004.   Liquidity and Capital Resources         Cash Flows.  The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of cash flow data (in millions):          52 Weeks Ended        January 28, 2006         January 29, 2005         January 31, 2004     Cash provided by (used for):                                                Operating activities        $   27.4         $  101.2         $   90.8             Investing activities          (67.9    )      (99.6    )      (51.5    )        Financing activities          71.3           32.1           (41.7    )         The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to a higher net loss, excluding the non-cash goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charge in fiscal 2004, an increase in the deferred income tax benefit and lower cash generated by operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to higher cash generated by operating assets and liabilities due to the timing of certain disbursements, partially offset by lower cash provided by operating earnings.        The decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures,  including technology investments, partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was due to higher capital expenditures,  including technology investments, and the acquisition of Community Supermarket Corporation, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of real estate.        The increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the proceeds related to the issuance of the Purchased Securities, net of debt repayments (see  Debt Service and Liquidity below) . The increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to net increased borrowings; fiscal 2003 included a $171.5 million repayment of the term loan, primarily from proceeds of $153.9 million from additional issuances of Senior Subordinated Notes.              Debt Service and Liquidity.  Our liquidity significantly improved on June 9, 2005, when pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we issued the Purchased Securities to the Investors for an aggregate purchase price of $150 million in cash. We received $137.5 million for the Purchased Securities, net of $12.5 million of costs directly attributable to the offering. We used $40.3 million of the net proceeds to pay down our working capital facility borrowings and $23.3 million to defease our mortgage borrowings. The remaining net proceeds were invested in short-term cash investments and are being used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures.    20         During fiscal 2004, we entered into the Credit Agreement which expires on October 1, 2009 and consists of a $180 million working capital facility, including letters of credit, (Working Capital Facility) and a $70 million term loan (Term Loan). The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among other things, place limits on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, issuance of cash-pay preferred stock, repurchase of company stock, incurrence of liens, sale-leaseback transactions, hedging activities, sale or discount of receivables, investments, loans, advances, guarantees with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, changing lines of business, repayments of other indebtedness, amendments to organizational documents and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The Credit Agreement also contains provisions permitting us to increase the size of the Working Capital Facility by $25 million and to repay and subsequently reborrow any portion of the Term Loan, in each instance subject to certain conditions. The Credit Agreement further provides that we must maintain a minimum inventory level of $150 million, that the maximum annual cash capital expenditures in a fiscal year are limited to the lesser of $150 million or an amount equal to our Consolidated EBITDA for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus any unused cash capital expenditures in the immediately preceding fiscal year up to a maximum of $20 million, and that we shall not, at any time, permit the ratio of Credit Extensions to Consolidated EBITDA (calculated on a trailing four-fiscal-quarters basis) at the end of any fiscal quarter to be more than (i) 2.4:1.0 for the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2005 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2006 and (ii) 1.9:1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter (the Senior Leverage Ratio). As used in the Credit Agreement, Credit Extensions mean the sum of the principal balance of all outstanding borrowings thereunder ($70 million as of January 28, 2006) and the amount of outstanding letters of credit ($81.5 million as of January 28, 2006). Based on the Senior Leverage Ratio at the end of fiscal 2005, we have full availability under the Working Capital Facility after giving effect to Credit Extensions of $98.5 million. Also, the Credit Agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends and contains customary events of default, including without limitation, payment defaults, material breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and a change of control (excluding the purchase by the Investors of the Purchased Securities). We were in compliance with all Credit Agreement covenants as of January 28, 2006.        We believe that cash flows from operations supplemented by our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement and the availability of capital lease financing will be sufficient to provide for our debt service requirements, working capital needs and capital expenditure program. However, in the event that cash flows from operations continue to decrease, we may decide to limit our future cash capital expenditure program and, subject to the Senior Leverage Ratio, our ability to utilize the full amount available under the Working Capital Facility could be limited.        There are no credit agency ratings-related triggers in either the Credit Agreement or in the indenture related to the Senior Subordinated Notes (the Indenture) that would adversely impact the cost of borrowings, annual amortization of principal or related debt maturities.        Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a premium that ranges between 1.50% to 2.25%, depending on the average remaining availability under the Credit Agreement. Our interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement is currently at LIBOR plus 1.75%. Under the Term Loan, we are required to make a balloon payment of $70 million on October 1, 2009. The Working Capital Facility also expires on October 1, 2009. The weighted-average interest rate in effect on all borrowings under the Term Loan was 5.3% during fiscal 2005.        All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our 100% owned subsidiaries, except our non-guarantor subsidiaries, which are comprised of four 100% owned and consolidated single-purpose entities. Each of these single-purpose entities owns the real estate on which a supermarket leased to Pathmark is located. The obligations under the Credit Agreement and those of the subsidiaries guaranteeing the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Companys tangible and intangible assets including, without limitation, intellectual property, real property, including leasehold interests, and the capital stock in each of these subsidiaries.        We have outstanding $350 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes, including $150 million issued at a premium, which pay cash interest semi-annually on February 1 and August 1. The Indenture contains a number of restrictive covenants, including a restriction on our ability to declare cash dividends on our common stock. We were in compliance with all Senior Subordinated Notes covenants as of January 28, 2006.    21           Contractual Obligations and Commitments.  We enter into a variety of legally binding obligations and commitments in the normal course of our business. The table below presents our long-term contractual obligations and commitments which represent known future cash payments that we will be required to make under existing contractual arrangements. Some amounts are based on managements estimates and assumptions and amounts actually paid may vary from those reflected below. The following table presents contractual obligations as of January 28, 2006 (in millions):          Payments Due by Fiscal Years                Total         2006         2007 and 2008         2009 and 2010         Thereafter        Debt obligations (1)              $    425.9         $      2.1         $      1.4         $     71.2         $    351.2          Interest on debt obligations          206.0           52.0           58.0           65.3           30.7          Capital lease obligations (1)          179.6           10.9           17.6           17.4           133.7          Interest on capital lease obligations          187.4           19.1           37.8           33.9           96.6          Operating lease obligations (2)          498.0           59.2           106.3           83.1           249.4          Purchase obligations (3)          693.3           103.7           203.6           201.4           184.6          Other liabilities (4)          248.8           54.2           56.7           44.7           93.2                             Total        $  2,439.0         $    301.2         $    481.4         $    517.0         $  1,139.4                               (1)   Debt and capital lease obligations include principal  payments only.       (2)   Operating lease obligations, net of sublease income of $56.1 million, are $441.9 million.       (3)   In addition to the purchase obligations reflected in the table above, we enter  into supply contracts to purchase products for resale in  the ordinary course of  business. This category of contracts covers a broad  spectrum of products and sometimes  includes specific merchandising obligations  relative to those products. These supply  contracts typically include either a  volume commitment or a fixed expiration date;  pricing terms based on the  vendors published list price; termination provisions;  and other standard  contractual considerations. Our obligation related to these  contracts is typically limited to return of unearned allowances and therefore no amounts  have  been included above. Purchase obligations shown above relate to the outsourcing  of a major portion of our distribution, trucking and information systems  functions  through long-term agreements, as noted below.    We  have a supply agreement with C&S, expiring in January  2013, pursuant to which C&S  supplies substantially all of our grocery,  frozen and perishable merchandise  requirements. Under our arrangement with  C&S, we negotiate prices, discounts and  promotions with vendors. We pay  C&S a per case upcharge, and have annual minimum  case commitments. The table  above reflects this minimum upcharge. During fiscal 2005,  the products supplied  from C&S accounted for approximately 62% of all of our  supermarket inventory  purchases. This agreement may only be terminated for cause or  certain events of  bankruptcy by either party.  In February 2005, we entered into a seven-year extension of  our existing outsourcing agreement with IBM to continue to provide a wide range  of information systems services, which commenced in 1991. Under the agreement,  IBM provides data center operations, mainframe processing, business applications  and systems development to enhance our customer service and efficiency. The  charges under this agreement are based upon the services requested at  predetermined rates. We may terminate this agreement with a payment of a  specified termination charge.   22    We also have an agreement, expiring in January 2014, with  GHI, a local trucking company, to provide us with trucking services. Under this  arrangement, there is an annual fixed fee in addition to transportation charges.  The fixed fee is reflected in the table above. We may terminate this agreement  with a payment of a specified termination charge. In addition, in connection  with the sale of the trucking business to GHI in 1997, GHI agreed to continue  making (and continues to make) contributions to the Local 863 Pension Fund (the  Fund), a multi-employer pension plan. The Company agreed in the sale  agreement that in the event GHI were to withdraw (as defined by the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)) from the Fund, to  indemnify GHI under certain circumstances against all liabilities it would have arising from such a withdrawal (Fund Withdrawal Liability) and to  provide a letter of credit in the full amount of the Fund Withdrawal Liability  to secure the potential indemnification obligation. In 1997, we delivered  letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $3 million in favor  of GHI and the Fund. In fiscal 2005, we delivered an additional $7 million  letter of credit in favor of GHI, and agreed to adjust said letter of credit (or  other collateral) up or down annually beginning in fiscal 2006 to reflect any  change in the maximum amount of the Fund Withdrawal Liability estimated for a  complete withdrawal by GHI from the Fund. We have also agreed with GHI that any  annual increase in said letter of credit would not exceed $5 million; provided, however, that in the event of certain change-of-control transactions involving  the Company (excluding the Yucaipa Investment), a failure to provide an annual  increase in the letter of credit when due, or a material adverse change in our  financial condition, we would be required to furnish a letter of credit in the  full amount of the Fund Withdrawal Liability (estimated by the actuary to the  multi-employer pension plan to be approximately $42 million), less any  outstanding letters of credit in favor of GHI and/or the Fund.        (4)   Other liabilities include estimated self-insured  obligations, estimated unfunded pension liabilities and estimated  post-retirement and post-employment obligations.          We had outstanding letters of credit of $81.5 million as of January 28, 2006, of which $79.9 million were standby letters of credit covering primarily self-insured or performance obligations. The remaining $1.6 million were commercial letters of credit supporting purchases of imported products.         Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  In the normal course of business, we have assigned to third parties various leases related to former businesses that we sold as well as former operating Pathmark supermarkets (the Assigned Leases). When the Assigned Leases were assigned, we generally remained secondarily liable with respect to these lease obligations. As such, if any of the assignees were to become unable to continue making rental payments under the Assigned Leases, under certain circumstances we could be required to assume the lease obligation. As of January 28, 2006, our records indicate that 62 Assigned Leases may still have term remaining; however, we have no way of knowing in many instances if such Assigned Leases are still actually in effect or have been terminated by our assignees or their successors. Assuming that each Assigned Lease is still in effect and that each respective assignee became unable to continue to make rental payments under an Assigned Lease, an event we believe to be remote, management estimates our maximum potential obligation with respect to the Assigned Leases to be approximately $92 million, which could be partially or totally offset by reassigning or subletting such leases. We have recognized a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 28, 2006 of $2.5 million, which represents certain guarantees attributable to our secondary liability in connection with Assigned Leases assigned after December 31, 2002. Additionally, during 1997, the Company sold its distribution operation to C&S and its trucking operation to GHI. In each case, C&S and GHI agreed to continue making (and continue to make) contributions to the applicable multi-employer pension plan. In connection with each sale, the Company agreed that, in the event of a withdrawal from the plan by the applicable acquiring party, it would, under certain circumstances and to a limited extent with respect to C&S, indemnify each of the acquirers with respect to such contingent withdrawal liability. The Company is also a party to a variety of contracts under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to the Companys commercial contracts, purchase and sale agreements, leases, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these contracts, the Company may provide routine indemnification relating to representations and warranties, or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Historically, the Company has not made a significant payment for these indemnifications.         Capital Expenditures.  Capital expenditures, including technology investments, were $64.5 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $119.0 million in fiscal 2004 and $79.3 million in fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 included $7.6 million related to the Initiative. During fiscal 2005, we opened two new stores, one of which was a replacement for a closed store, closed four stores and completed eight store renovations. During fiscal 2004, we opened three new stores, one of which was formerly operated by joint venture and was previously included in our store count, closed two stores, one of which was formerly operated by a joint venture, and completed 19 store renovations. During fiscal 2006, our capital expenditure plan is to invest approximately $70 million in 16 store renovations and in technology investments.   23         Contingencies.  We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary cause of business. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We have taken certain tax positions, which may be challenged, and have reserved for such tax positions in noncurrent liabilities as payment, if any, is not expected within one year. While the ultimate resolution of these positions cannot be determined with any degree of certainty, management believes that the aggregate contingencies, if any, when compared to the amounts reserved, will not have a material effect on our financial statements taken as a whole.   Critical Accounting Policies        Our discussion of results of operations and financial condition relies on our financial statements that are prepared based on certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgments and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. We believe that investors need to be aware of these policies and how they impact our financial statements as a whole, as well as our related discussion and analysis presented herein. While we believe that these accounting policies are based on sound measurement criteria, actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates or forecasts. The accounting policies and related risk described in this report are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and estimates.         Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.  It is our accounting policy to assess the carrying value of our long-lived assets for possible impairment on an individual store basis to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their related undiscounted cash flows. Based on our fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2003 assessments, we concluded there were no impairments of our long-lived assets. In fiscal 2004, we estimated future cash flows based on economic and business assumptions and concluded that there was an impairment of $15.2 million. Since our estimates project cash flow several years into the future, they could be affected by variable factors such as inflation and economic conditions.         Goodwill Impairment.  We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Based on our fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2003 evaluations, we concluded there were no impairments of our goodwill. In fiscal 2004 we concluded that there was a $293.8 million impairment of our goodwill. Since such impairment analysis is based on economic and business assumptions, the goodwill impairment analysis in the future could be affected by changes in these business and economic conditions, changes in consumer spending, the competitive environment in which we operate and other risks detailed elsewhere in this report.         Pension Plans.  For all our pension plans, pension expense was $5.3 million (including a $7.5 million charge related to the retirement incentive program and executive separations) for fiscal 2005, and pension income was $4.1 million and $4.3 million (including a $2.1 million charge related to the retirement incentive program) for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively, and was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions. The expected return on assets of the Pathmark Stores, Inc. Pension Plan (the Qualified Plan) represents the weighted-average of expected returns for each asset category, which have been developed using information from a number of third-party consultants and long-term historical data on returns for different asset categories and inflation. We also considered the Qualified Plans historical 10-year and 20-year compounded returns of 10.7% and 12.7%, respectively, which have exceeded broad market returns over comparable periods, indicating a significant premium has been gained through active management of plan assets. Based on these factors and the asset allocation discussed below, we elected to use a 9.0% expected return on plan assets in determining pension cost for fiscal 2005. This was consistent with fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. Our assumption was net of expected plan expenses payable from the trust fund, which was less than 0.5% of plan assets.    24         The expected long-term rate of return on our Qualified Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 70% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 10.5%, and 30% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 5.5% (both were net of expected plan expenses payable from the trust fund). Because of market fluctuation, our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2005 was 74% with equity managers and 26% with fixed income managers. We believe, however, that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. An additional 0.5% reduction in our expected long-term rate of return on Qualified Plan assets, holding all other factors constant, would have increased pension expense during fiscal 2005 by approximately $1.3 million.        We base our determination of pension expense or income, in part, on a market-related valuation of assets that reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market value of assets. As of January 28, 2006, we had cumulative net actuarial gains of approximately $6.6 million, due to the differences between expected and actual return on plan assets, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets. These unrecognized net actuarial gains may result in increases in our future pension income depending on several factors, including future asset gains and losses and whether such gains and losses, as recognized at each measurement date, together with other actuarial experience recognized, exceed the corridor in which gains and losses are not amortized, in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime of participants expected to receive benefits from the plan (a period of 12.2 years for the Qualified Plan for fiscal 2005).        The discount rate used reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on our annual measurement date (December 31) and is subject to change each year. The discount rate was determined by matching, on an approximate basis, the coupons and maturities for a portfolio of corporate bonds (rated Aa or better by Moodys Investor Services) to the expected plan benefit payments defined by the Projected Benefit Obligation. The discount rate determined on this basis was 5.75% as of January 28, 2006 and as of January 29, 2005. Pension income is sensitive to the discount rate and salary increase assumptions used. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate and salary increase assumptions used would have increased pension expense during fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.7 million. A 0.25% increase in salary raises assumed would have increased pension expense during fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.5 million.        Based on an expected return on plan assets assumption of 9.0%, a discount rate of 5.75% and our various other relevant current assumptions, we estimate that our pension income for all pension plans combined will approximate $1.5 million for fiscal 2006, $2.2 million for fiscal 2007 and $3.1 million for fiscal 2008. Actual pension income in the future will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension plans.        The value of our Qualified Plan assets has increased from $262.8 million at December 31, 2004 to $270.9 million at December 31, 2005. Accruing benefits, unfavorable actuarial experience and the additional liability resulting from the retirement incentive program, have lowered the overfunded status of our Qualified Plan, net of benefit obligations, from $72.5 million at December 31, 2004 to $58.4 million at December 31, 2005. We believe that, based on our actuarial assumptions and due to the overfunded status of our Qualified Plan, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our Qualified Plan for at least the next three years.              Self-Insured Claims Liabilities and Postemployment Benefits.  We are self insured for claims relating to customer, associate and vehicle accidents, as well as certain associate medical and disability benefits, and, except for associate medical insurance, we maintain third-party excess insurance coverage for such claims. It is our accounting policy to record a self-insured liability, as determined actuarially on a consistent basis, based on the facts and circumstances of each individual claim filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported discounted at a risk-free interest rate. All claims and their related liabilities are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning such claims is subject to variability primarily due to external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, benefit levels and claim settlement patterns. At January 28, 2006, liabilities for self-insured claims and benefits were $59.3 million and for postemployment benefits were $6.7 million.    25    New Accounting Pronouncements        In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which replaced SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and superseded Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APBO) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This statement requires compensation costs relating to share-based payment transactions, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The pro forma disclosure previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 will no longer be an acceptable alternative to recognition of expenses in the financial statements. The effective date of this statement was deferred until the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, i.e., for our first quarterly reporting period ending April 29, 2006. As a result, we will adopt this statement in fiscal 2006. We currently measure compensation costs related to share-based payments under APBO No. 25, as allowed by SFAS No. 123, and provides the required disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. This statement provides for two transition alternatives: modified-prospective transition or modified-retrospective transition. We will be using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost will be recognized beginning in fiscal 2006 for all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense for fiscal 2006 to be approximately $5.1 million for the unvested portion of previously granted awards. This statement also requires us to include the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense be reported as financing activity in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The future impact on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows cannot be estimated at this time.        In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections  a replacement of APBO No. 20 and SFAS No. 3. This statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition through a cumulative adjustment within net income in the period of the change. This statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change and is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.        In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 13-1 Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period, which concluded that rental costs incurred during and after a construction period are for the right to control the use of a leased asset and must be recognized as rental expense. Such costs were previously capitalizable as construction costs if the company had a policy to do so. This FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect that the implementation of FSP No. FAS 13-1 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.        In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, which address the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the timing and measurement of an impairment loss. These FSPs are required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We do not expect the adoption of these FSPs will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.        Our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates. Variable rate debt outstanding under our Term Loan was $70.0 million on January 28, 2006. During fiscal 2005, the average interest rates in effect on borrowings under our Term Loan was 5.3%. A 1% change in interest rates applied to the $70.0 million balance of floating-rate Term Loan debt would affect pre-tax annual results of operations by approximately $0.7 million. Our Senior Subordinated Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.75%, and are, therefore, not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations. The principal objective of our treasury management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to facilitate our funding needs. As part of our risk management, we may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps in the future.    26        Item 8. Financial Statements.
