ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2002 ("FISCAL 2001"), FEBRUARY 3, 2001 ("FISCAL 2000") AND JANUARY 29, 2000 ("FISCAL 1999"), WHICH ARE INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. THE RESULTS OF THE PREDECESSOR COMPANY AND SUCCESSOR COMPANY HAVE BEEN COMBINED FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2001 SINCE SEPARATE DISCUSSIONS ARE NOT MEANINGFUL IN TERMS OF THEIR OPERATING RESULTS OR COMPARISONS TO THE OTHER PERIODS.  GENERAL      We are a leading supermarket chain in the Northeast, operating 141 supermarkets in the densely populated New York-New Jersey and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. These metropolitan areas contain over 10% of the population in the United States. All of our supermarkets are located within 100 miles of our corporate office in Carteret, New Jersey.      We formally exited from Chapter 11 effective September 19, 2000, which we refer to as the "Plan Effective Date". For financial reporting purposes, we accounted for the consummation of the plan of reorganization effective September 16, 2000, the Saturday nearest the Plan Effective Date. Fresh-Start Reporting resulted in significant changes to the valuation of certain of our assets and liabilities, and to our stockholders' equity. With the adoption of Fresh-Start Reporting, a new entity was deemed created for financial reporting purposes. The periods prior to the Plan Effective Date have been designated "Predecessor Company" and the periods subsequent to the Plan Effective Date have been designated "Successor Company". For separate presentations of the results of the Predecessor Company and Successor Company for these periods, see our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data (in millions):                                                                                         FISCAL YEAR                                                          ------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 2001                   2000                   1999                                                          --------------------  ---------------------  ---------------------                                                           AMOUNT       %         AMOUNT       %        AMOUNT        %                                                          ---------- ---------  ----------- ---------  ----------  ---------              Sales..................................................  $ 3,963.3    100.0%   $  3,841.9    100.0%   $  3,698.1    100.0%                                                          ========== =========  =========== =========  ==========  ========= Gross profit...........................................  $ 1,107.7     27.9%   $  1,080.8     28.1%   $  1,058.7     28.6% Selling, general and administrative expenses...........

Sales in fiscal 2001 were $3.96 billion compared to $3.84 billion in fiscal 2000, an increase of 3.2%. Total sales, excluding the extra week in fiscal 2000, increased 5.1% in fiscal 2001. The sales increase in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to higher same store sales (stores opened the entire year in both fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, including replacement stores and enlargements and excluding the extra week in fiscal 2000) of 2.5% and new stores. Sales also benefited from our various post-restructuring initiatives and increased promotional spending, such as double coupons. During fiscal 2001, we opened five new stores, closed two stores and renovated 34 stores. We operated 141 and 138 stores at the end of fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively.                                          18        GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit represents the remaining amount of sales after deducting cost of goods, which includes the costs of inventory sold and the related purchase and distribution costs, net of vendor allowances and rebates. Gross profit in fiscal 2001 was $1.11 billion or 27.9% of sales compared to $1.08 billion or 28.1% of sales for fiscal 2000. The increase in gross profit of $26.9 million for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was due to higher sales, partially offset by higher promotional expenses and shrink. The decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the impact of our promotional initiatives to generate sales and higher shrink.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ("SG&A"). SG&A in fiscal 2001 increased $31.4 million or 3.5% compared to fiscal 2000. This increase in SG&A was primarily due to higher expenses related to store labor and related benefits and occupancy as well as preopening expenses of $2.5 million related to the six former Grand Union stores and a charge of $1.8 million related to the closing of two under-performing stores on August 4, 2001, partially offset by income of $3.3 million resulting from the partial settlement of a lawsuit related to price fixing of prescription drugs. Included in fiscal 2000 were gains on the sale of certain real estate of $1.8 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 23.2% and 23.1% in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively.      DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Depreciation and amortization of $76.7 million in fiscal 2001 was $2.9 million higher than the $73.8 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to the impact of our stepped up capital program and technology initiatives. Depreciation and amortization includes video tape amortization of $2.2 million in fiscal 2000. There is no video tape amortization in fiscal 2001 since we discontinued our video tape rental business in fiscal 2000.      REORGANIZATION INCOME. Reorganization income of $6.5 million in fiscal 2000 was comprised of a gain of $25.6 million related to the difference between the estimated lessor claims for rejected leases and the liabilities previously recorded for such leases, net of $19.1 million of fees directly attributable to the plan of reorganization.      AMORTIZATION OF EXCESS REORGANIZATION VALUE. Excess reorganization value of $798.0 million is being amortized over three years. Amortization expense was $265.5 million and $98.5 million for fiscal 2001 and for fiscal 2000, respectively. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was due to a full year of amortization in fiscal 2001. With the adoption of SFAS No. 142, our excess reorganization value will no longer be amortized subsequent to fiscal 2001 but rather will be evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or change in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.      OPERATING EARNINGS (LOSS). Fiscal 2001 operating loss was $154.9 million compared to fiscal 2000 operating earnings of $26.0 million. The decrease in operating earnings in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to the amortization of the excess reorganization value in fiscal 2001.      INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. Interest expense was $65.3 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $126.8 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to the cancellation of $1.0 billion in subordinated debt under the plan of reorganization and favorable LIBOR borrowing rates under our credit agreement.      INCOME TAX PROVISION. The income tax provision was $18.5 million and $14.8 million in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively. Refer to Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements for information related to our income taxes. During fiscal 2001, we made income tax payments of $1.0 million and received income tax refunds of $15,000. During fiscal 2000, we made income tax payments of $0.2 million and received income tax refunds of $0.5 million.      EXTRAORDINARY ITEM. In fiscal 2001, the extraordinary item of $3.3 million, net of an income tax benefit of $2.3 million, represents costs incurred resulting from the early extinguishment of debt, including the write-off of deferred financing costs, related to the pay down of a portion of the credit agreement from certain of the proceeds of the $200 million senior subordinated notes issued on January 29, 2002. In fiscal 2000, the extraordinary item of $313.7 million, net of an income tax provision of $46.6 million, represents income from the cancellation of debt related to the exchange of bond indebtedness and accrued interest for common stock and warrants; such income was reduced by the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the former bank credit facility and bond indebtedness subject to exchange.                                           19        SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS. Net loss in fiscal 2001 was $242.0 million compared to net earnings of $198.1 million for fiscal 2000. This increase in net loss was primarily due to the increase in the amortization of excess reorganization value in fiscal 2001 and the extraordinary item of $313.7 million in fiscal 2000. Excluding the amortization of excess reorganization value and the extraordinary item, net earnings were $26.8 million in fiscal 2001. Excluding the extraordinary item, the reorganization income and the amortization of excess reorganization value, net loss was $20.5 million in fiscal 2000.  FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999      SALES. Sales in fiscal 2000 were $3.84 billion compared to $3.70 billion in fiscal 1999, an increase of 3.9%. Same store sales (stores opened the entire year in both fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, including replacement stores and enlargements and excluding the extra week in fiscal 2000) increased 0.3% in fiscal 2000. Total sales, excluding the extra week, increased 1.9% in fiscal 2000. Sales in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 were also impacted by new store openings in fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2000, we opened four new stores, including one replacement store, and renovated 19 stores. We operated 138 and 135 stores at the end of fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively.      GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit in fiscal 2000 was $1.08 billion or 28.1% of sales compared to $1.06 billion or 28.6% of sales for fiscal 1999. The increase in gross profit of $22.1 million for fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was due to higher sales, partially offset by higher promotional expenses and shrink.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SG&A in fiscal 2000 increased $38.7 million or 4.6% compared to fiscal 1999. The increase in SG&A for fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily due to higher expenses related to store labor and related benefits and higher operating costs in general, primarily due to the additional week in fiscal 2000. Included in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 were gains on the sale of certain real estate of $1.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 23.1% in fiscal 2000, up from 23.0% in fiscal 1999.      DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Depreciation and amortization of $73.8 million in fiscal 2000 was $1.3 million lower than the $75.1 million in fiscal 1999. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily due to the impact of lower capital expenditures in fiscal 2000. Depreciation and amortization excludes video tape amortization, which is recorded in cost of goods sold, of $2.2 million and $3.3 million in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively.      REORGANIZATION INCOME. Reorganization income of $6.5 million for fiscal 2000 was comprised of a gain of $25.6 million related to the difference between the estimated lessor claims for rejected leases and the liabilities previously recorded for such leases, net of $19.1 million of fees directly attributable to the plan of reorganization.      AMORTIZATION OF EXCESS REORGANIZATION VALUE: Excess reorganization value of $798.0 million is being amortized over three years. Amortization expense for fiscal 2000 commenced on the Plan Effective Date and was $98.5 million.      OPERATING EARNINGS. Operating earnings were $26.0 million in fiscal year 2000 compared to $133.3 million in fiscal 1999. The decrease in operating earnings in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily due to the amortization of the excess reorganization value.      INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. Interest expense was $126.8 million in fiscal 2000 compared to $163.1 million in fiscal 1999. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily due to the cancellation of subordinated debt under the plan of reorganization.      INCOME TAX PROVISION. The income tax provision was $14.8 million and $2.1 million in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively. Refer to Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements for information related to our income taxes. During fiscal 2000, we made income tax payments of $0.2 million and received income tax refunds of $0.5 million. During fiscal 1999, we made income tax payments of $0.5 million and received income tax refunds of $1.9 million.                                           20        EXTRAORDINARY ITEM. In fiscal 2000, the extraordinary item of $313.7 million, net of an income tax provision of $46.6 million, represents income from the cancellation of debt related to the exchange of bond indebtedness and accrued interest for common stock and warrants; such income was reduced by the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the former bank credit facility and bond indebtedness subject to exchange. Since the realization of such income occurred under the Bankruptcy Code, we did not recognize income from the cancellation of debt for tax purposes, but elected to reduce, at the beginning of fiscal 2001, the basis of our depreciable property and, with the remaining income from the cancellation of debt, to reduce our net operating loss tax carryforwards. The income tax provision related to the extraordinary item was based on the deferred tax impact of the tax attribute reductions, net of the valuation allowance reversal related to certain deferred tax assets.      SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS. Our net earnings was $198.1 million in fiscal 2000 compared to a net loss of $31.9 million in fiscal 1999. The increase in net earnings in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily due to the extraordinary item and the reorganization income, partially offset by the amortization of the excess reorganization value. Excluding the extraordinary item, the reorganization income and the amortization of excess reorganization value, net loss was $20.5 million in fiscal 2000.  EBITDA      EBITDA represents earnings from operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, the gain (loss) on sale of real estate, reorganization income and the LIFO charge (credit). While EBITDA is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company's ability to service and/or incur debt, it should not be construed as an alternative to, or a better indicator of, operating earnings or of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our measurement of EBITDA, as presented below (in millions), may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies:                                                                                                FISCAL YEAR                                                                             -------------------------------------                                                                                 2001          2000         1999                                                                             ----------    ----------   ----------        Net loss before extraordinary items.......................................  $  (238.7)    $ (115.6)    $   (31.9) Adjustments to calculate EBITDA:   Interest expense, net...................................................       65.3        126.8         163.1   Income tax provision....................................................       18.5         14.8           2.1   Depreciation and amortization...........................................       76.7         76.0(1)       78.4(1)   Amortization of excess reorganization value.............................      265.5         98.5             --   Gain on sale of real estate.............................................          --        (1.8)         (0.4)   Reorganization income...................................................          --        (6.5)            --   LIFO charge.............................................................        1.9          1.0             --                                                                             ----------    ----------   ---------- EBITDA....................................................................  $   189.2     $  193.2     $   211.3                                                                             ==========    ==========   ==========    - -------- (1) Includes amortization of video tapes of $2.2 million and $3.3 million in     fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively; in fiscal 2000, we discontinued     our video tape rental business.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      As a result of the substantial debt reduction resulting from the plan of reorganization in fiscal 2000, our debt service and liquidity have improved significantly compared to the Predecessor Company's financial condition.      CASH FLOWS. The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of cash flow data (in millions):                                                                                                FISCAL YEAR                                                                             -------------------------------------                                                                                2001          2000         1999                                                                             ----------    ----------   ---------- Cash provided by (used for):          Operating activities....................................................  $   82.6      $   66.0     $    21.9   Investing activities....................................................

The increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily due to the reduction in cash interest paid due to the impact of the plan of reorganization. The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to our planned increase in capital expenditures, including technology investments. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily due to a decrease in expenditures for property and equipment and an increase in proceeds from property sales or disposals. The increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to debt and lease paydown in fiscal 2001 compared to the impact of the plan of reorganization in fiscal 2000. The increase in cash flow from financing activities in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily due to the impact of the plan of reorganization.      DEBT SERVICE AND LIQUIDITY. On January 29, 2002, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of unregistered 8 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 ("Senior Subordinated Notes"), which pay cash interest on a semiannual basis. The Senior Subordinated Notes are unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the subsidiary guarantors and contain customary covenants. The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Subordinated Notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding loans under our bank credit facility and to repay in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 a portion of our outstanding industrial revenue bonds. We recently completed an exchange offer pursuant to which all of the Senior Subordinated Notes were exchanged for $200 million aggregate principal amount of our registered 8 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes, due 2012, (referred to as the exchange notes). The exchange notes will be governed by the indenture and supplemental indenture relating to the Senior Subordinated Notes. The form and terms of the exchange notes are identical in all material respects to the form and terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes, except that the exchange notes have been registered under the Securities Act, and therefore contain no restrictive legends.      On the Plan Effective Date, we entered into a credit agreement, which included a $425.0 million term loan consisting of $125.0 million of Term Loan A and $300.0 million of Term Loan B and a $175.0 million working capital facility (the "Credit Agreement"). Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates, ranging from LIBOR plus 3% on Term Loan A and the working capital facility to LIBOR plus 4% on Term Loan B. The weighted average interest rate for the term loan was 8.0% during fiscal 2001. We are required to repay a portion of our borrowing under the term loan each year, so as to retire such indebtedness in its entirety by July 15, 2007. Under the working capital facility, which expires on July 15, 2005, we can borrow an amount up to $175.0 million, including a maximum of $125.0 million in letters of credit. We used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the Senior Subordinated Notes to prepay all of our outstanding indebtedness under Term Loan A which, at January 29, 2002, amounted to $112.5 million, and to prepay $80.5 million of our indebtedness under Term Loan B.      As of February 2, 2002 and April 16, 2002, no borrowings have been made under the working capital facility. Letters of credit of $41.6 million and $40.2 million were outstanding as of February 2, 2002 and April 16, 2002, respectively. Our liquidity also included cash equivalents of $12.9 million and $8.1 million as of February 2, 2002 and April 16, 2002, respectively.      Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, other than certain specific assets secured by third-party mortgages. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and other terms. We were in compliance with all of these covenants as of February 2, 2002 and, based on management's operating projections for fiscal 2002, we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with such covenants. We were also in compliance with all provisions of the indentures relating to the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes and of our mortgage indebtedness.                                          22        The following table presents significant contractual obligations as of February 2, 2002 (in millions):                 FISCAL                                               LONG-TERM     CAPITAL      OPERATING             YEARS                                                  DEBT       LEASES        LEASES          TOTAL          ------------                                           ---------    ----------    ----------    -----------                   2002................................................   $    7.9     $    36.1     $   43.1      $     87.1          2003................................................        1.3          30.6         41.6            73.5          2004................................................        1.3          26.9         40.3            68.5          2005................................................       54.8          23.0         39.8           117.6          2006................................................      108.4          21.3         36.8           166.5          Thereafter..........................................      274.8         252.7        293.7           821.2                                                                 ---------    ----------    ----------    -----------          Total...............................................   $  448.5     $   390.6     $  495.3      $  1,334.4                                                                 =========    ==========    ==========    ===========        The $41.6 million in letters of credit outstanding as of February 2, 2002 expire in fiscal 2002.      In addition, we outsourced a major portion of our distribution, trucking and information system functions through long-term agreements as follows:      o   In April 2001, we entered into a new five-year outsourcing agreement         with International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") to continue to         provide a wide range of information systems services. Under the         agreement, IBM provides data center operations, mainframe processing,         business applications and systems development to enhance our customer         service and efficiency. The charges under this agreement are based upon         the services requested at predetermined rates. We may terminate the         agreement upon 90 days notice with a payment of a specified termination         charge.      o   We have a 15-year supply agreement with C&S, expiring in 2013, pursuant         to which C&S supplies substantially all of our grocery, frozen and         perishable merchandise requirements. Under our arrangement with C&S, we         negotiate prices, discounts and promotions with vendors. During fiscal         2001, the products supplied from C&S accounted for approximately 61% of         all of our supermarket inventory purchases. This agreement may be         terminated for cause or certain events of bankruptcy by either party.      o   We also have a ten-year agreement, expiring in 2007, with a local         trucking company to provide us with trucking services We may terminate         the agreement with a payment of a specified termination charge.      CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. Capital expenditures, including property acquired under capital leases and technology investments, were $130.5 million for fiscal 2001 compared to $66.9 million for fiscal 2000 and $87.6 million for fiscal 1999. During fiscal 2001, we purchased six former Grand Union stores and opened five of them as Pathmark stores; in addition, we renovated 34 stores and closed two under-performing stores. During fiscal 2000, we opened four new stores, including one replacement store and renovated 19 stores. In 2002, our capital expenditure plan is to invest $135.0 million in new stores and major renovations and technology investments. During fiscal 2002, we expect to open six additional stores, including the sixth former Grand Union store, and complete 19 store renovations.      We believe that cash flows generated from operations, supplemented by the unused borrowing capacity under the working capital facility, our cash equivalents and the availability of capital lease financing will be sufficient to provide for our debt service requirements, working capital needs and capital expenditure program for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that we will maintain our ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES      The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The following accounting policies are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our financial statements.                                          23        SELF-INSURED CLAIMS LIABILITIES. We are self insured for claims relating to customer, associate and vehicle accidents, as well as associate medical and disability benefits, and we maintain third-party excess insurance coverage for such claims. It is our accounting policy to record a self-insured liability, as determined actuarially on a consistent basis, based on the facts and circumstances of each individual claim filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. All claims and their related liabilities are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning such claims is subject to variability primarily due to external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, benefit levels and claim settlement patterns. The total self-insured liabilities for such claims and benefits approximates $94.6 million at February 2, 2002.      IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLES AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS. It is our accounting policy to assess the carrying value of our intangibles and long-lived assets for possible impairment based on groups of assets to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their related undiscounted cash flows. We estimated future cash flows based on several economic and business assumptions and have concluded that there is no impairment of such assets at February 2, 2002. However, our estimates project cash flow several years into the future and could be affected by variable factors such as inflation and economic conditions.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (the "APB") Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 38, "Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises." All business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 are now accounted for using the purchase method. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements.      In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." It addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets (but not those acquired in a business combination) should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition. This statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 are required to be adopted effective with our fiscal year 2002. Our excess reorganization value account will no longer be amortized subsequent to fiscal 2001 but rather will be evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have an effect on the impairment of our excess reorganization value account but will eliminate the amortization of excess reorganization value in fiscal 2002, which was $265.5 million in fiscal 2001.      In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Such associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The provisions of SFAS No. 143 are required to be adopted effective with our first quarter of fiscal year 2003. We have not determined the impact, if any, that the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations.      In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," and APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations--Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." SFAS No. 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 are required to be adopted effective with our first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2002. We have not determined the impact, if any, that the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations.                                          24        In November 2001, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 01-09, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor's Products." EITF Issue No. 01-09 codifies and reconciles the consensuses on all or specific issues of EITF Issues No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," No. 00-22, "Accounting for `Points' and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentives Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to be Delivered in the Future," and No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products," which address various aspects of the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor's products. We don't expect that the adoption of the EITF Issue No. 01-09 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK      We are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates. Our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating rate debt to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, and other operational and investment requirements. At February 2, 2002, we had fixed-rate debt outstanding of $230.5 million and floating rate debt of $218.0 million. Such floating rate debt was incurred under our bank credit facility, bearing interest at LIBOR + 4.00% per annum at February 2, 2002.      To manage our interest rate risk, in July 2001, we entered into a three-year interest rate zero-cost collar, consisting of a cap with a strike of 10% and a floor with a strike of 8.39%, with a major international financial institution, on a notional amount of $150 million of our term loan. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes but rather to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates. This derivative is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and at inception was designated, and continues to qualify, as a cash-flow hedge of our forecasted variable interest rate payments due on the term loan. We have formally documented our risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking any hedge transaction. We are continuously evaluating the risk to our remaining long-term debt and will implement additional interest rate hedging arrangements when deemed appropriate. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates at February 2, 2002 would increase interest expense incurred under the bank credit facility for fiscal 2002 by approximately $0.7 million.                                          25    ITEM 8.
