Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and            Results of Operations.  General  The Bombay Company, Inc. ("Company" or "Bombay") designs, sources and markets a unique line of home accessories, wall decor and furniture through 419 retail stores in 42 states in the United States and nine Canadian provinces, through specialty catalogs and over the Internet in the U.S. and internationally.  Merchandise is manufactured to Company specification through a network of contract manufacturers located principally in Asia and North America.  In addition to its primary retail operations, the Company has several other initiatives underway. Bailey Street Trading Company ("Bailey Street") represents the Company's wholesale operations, begun in Fiscal 2000. Bailey Street reached the $2 million sales mark in Fiscal 2001 and is proving to be a viable, low-risk growth vehicle for the Company. Sales are projected at $5 million for 2002 and modest, positive earnings per share contributions are expected as early as the current year.  International expansion has progressed with licensed international stores currently operating in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Kuwait. There are commitments with the Company's current international partners to open three additional stores in Fiscal 2002 including one each in the Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The Company plans to continue expansion of the Bombay brand abroad through licensing and distribution agreements with local partners in various markets, limiting the Company's risk by initially entering smaller, opportunistic markets with growth potential.  Finally, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2001, the Company launched Bombay KIDS ("KIDS"), its new line of children's furniture, textile and accessory collections, with initial offerings exclusively through separate catalog and Internet channels. During Fiscal 2002, KIDS will be tested in several retail stores.  The largest percentage of the Company's sales and operating income is realized in the fiscal quarter that includes December (Christmas season).  Because the majority of the Company's products are proprietary, the impact of inflation on operating results is typically not significant. The Company attempts to alleviate inflationary pressures by increasing selling prices (subject to competitive conditions), improving designs and finding alternative production sources in lower cost countries.  The Company has a retail (52-53 week) fiscal year which ends on the Saturday nearest January 31.  Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 1999 represent 52 week periods while Fiscal 2000 included 53 weeks.  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  Certain statements in this Annual Report to Shareholders under "Management's Discussion and Analysis" constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, the following: the impact on consumer spending generally, and on the Company, in particular, in light of the events of September 11, 2001; downward pressure in retail due to continuing economic pessimism; competition; seasonality; success of operating initiatives; new product development and introduction schedules; acceptance of new product offerings; advertising and promotional efforts; adverse publicity; expansion of the store chain; availability, locations and terms of sites for store development; changes in business strategy or development plans; availability and terms of capital; labor and employee benefit costs; changes in government regulations; risks associated with international business and regional weather conditions.   11  Net Revenues  Net  revenues  consist  of sales to retail customers  and  wholesale  sales through  Bailey  Street  and  to our international  licensees  as  well  as shipping fees. Shipping fees reflect revenue from customers for delivery of merchandise.  Wholesale sales are immaterial for all periods,  representing less than 1% of total revenue and as such are not separately reported.     (In millions)                  Fiscal 2001    Fiscal 2000    Fiscal 1999         Sales               $434.7         $421.5         $390.9 Shipping               2.8            2.0            1.7    Total            $437.5         $423.5         $392.6     Fiscal 2001  Net revenues increased $14.0 million, or 3%, to $437.5 million, compared to $423.5 million in Fiscal 2000 primarily due to new store openings. During the year, the Company opened 32 new stores, including 12 outlets, and 18 regular stores were converted to the large store format. These increases were partially offset by the closure of 21 stores.  Same store sales (stores in existence for one year or more) declined 2% for the year. The lack of a 53rd week during Fiscal 2001 adversely impacted sales comparisons by approximately 2%.  At the end of Fiscal 2001, the Company had 324 large stores, 59 regular stores and 36 outlets resulting in a 10% increase in retail square footage.  Our customer's resistance to big-ticket purchases during the year resulted in a shift in the overall product mix. Furniture sales were 43% of the total during Fiscal 2001 compared to 45% in Fiscal 2000. Accessories represented 43% in the current year compared to 41% last year, while wall decor (principally prints, mirrors and sconces) accounted for 14% in both years. Total transactions for the year increased 2% while the average ticket remained constant at $79. The growth in the accessories business resulted in an increase in the average number of items per transaction year over year, offsetting the impact of shifts in the product mix.  All regions of the U.S. and Canada reported low single-digit same store sales declines for the year. Outlet stores continued to perform well during Fiscal 2001, reporting low single-digit same store sales gains.  Fiscal 2000  Net revenues increased $30.9 million, or 8%, to $423.5 million, compared to $392.6 million in Fiscal 1999. Sales increases were attributable to a 5% increase in same store sales. A 53rd week in the Fiscal 2000 calendar added less than 2% to the total sales increase. Sales increases were also realized with the opening of 10 new stores during the year and the conversion of another 20 regular stores to the larger store format. These increases were partially offset by the closure of 17 stores which were either under-performing or at the end of their lease lives. On a net basis, the number of stores went from 415 at the end of Fiscal 1999 to 408 at the end of Fiscal 2000, including 291 large stores, 93 regular stores and 24 outlet stores, while total retail square footage increased approximately 2.5%.  Sales growth was fairly consistent across all categories with the product mix remaining virtually unchanged. Sales in Fiscal 2000 consisted of 45% furniture, 41% accessories and 14% wall decor. In Fiscal 1999 the product mix was 45% furniture, 40% accessories and 15% wall decor. The number of transactions increased by 9% and the average ticket remained virtually unchanged at $79.  Same store sales gains were strongest in the Company's Canadian subsidiary, with other strong performances in the western and northeastern portions  of the  U.S.  All regions reported positive or flat same store sales.  Outlets also  performed  well,  driven by the continued  infusion  of  outlet  only merchandise.   12  Cost of Sales, Buying and Store Occupancy Costs   (In millions)                            Fiscal 2001     Fiscal 2000     Fiscal 1999         Cost of sales, buying   and occupancy costs        $309.6           $291.7         $273.5 Shipping                        3.9              2.3            2.0   Total                      $313.5           $294.0         $275.5     Fiscal 2001  Cost of sales, including buying and store occupancy costs, for Fiscal 2001 was $313.5 million or 71.7% of revenues. As a percentage of revenues, these costs increased from 69.4% of revenues in Fiscal 2000. Product margins declined 130 basis points as a result of the more promotionally driven retail environment. Same stores sales declines which contributed to a lower sales per square foot resulted in negative leverage of the buying and occupancy costs. These costs were 20.4% of revenues, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year. Buying and occupancy costs included an impairment charge of $715,000 to write down the fixed assets related to eleven unprofitable stores.  Fiscal 2000  Cost of sales, including buying and store occupancy costs, for Fiscal 2000 was $294.0 million or 69.4% of revenues. As a percentage of revenues, these costs decreased from 70.2% of revenues in Fiscal 1999. Product margins improved 20 basis points from the prior year due to an improved product mix and good in-stock positions of key merchandise, more than offsetting higher distribution center and domestic freight costs. Buying and occupancy costs declined 60 basis points to 19.5% of revenues while increasing $3.4 million. The higher dollar costs were primarily driven by investments in new stores and technology. The improvement in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues is due to the relatively fixed nature of these costs measured against a higher revenue base.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Fiscal 2001  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $117.6 million compared to $115.6 million in Fiscal 2000. Although the dollars increased $2.0 million or 1.8%, as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative costs declined from 27.3% in Fiscal 2000 to 26.9% in Fiscal 2001. The 40 basis point decline is the result of strong controls over expenses throughout the year.  Fiscal 2000  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $115.6 million, an increase of $9.6 million or 9%, compared to $106.0 million in Fiscal 1999. The largest component of the dollar increase was higher payroll and related costs. However, as a percentage of revenues these costs remained relatively constant. The Company's investments in infrastructure and technology also contributed to higher selling, general and administrative expenses with increased depreciation, amortization and related costs. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 27.0% in Fiscal 1999 to 27.3% in Fiscal 2000.   13  Interest  Fiscal 2001  The Company had interest income of $248,000 and interest expense of $566,000, compared to interest income of $967,000 and interest expense of $424,000 in Fiscal 2000. Changes in interest amounts resulted from lower average cash balances and greater utilization of credit facilities due to the Company's lower operating profits, higher average inventory levels and capital  expenditures.  Fiscal 2000  The Company had interest income of $967,000 and interest expense of $424,000, compared to interest income of $1.1 million and interest expense of $59,000 in Fiscal 1999.  The changes in these amounts are due to lower average cash balances and greater utilization of seasonal borrowings to support the Company's investments in store expansion, infrastructure and technology, the stock repurchase program and higher inventory levels.  Income Taxes  The Company provided income taxes of $2.3 million, $5.8 million and  $4.8 million in Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999, respectively. The effective rates were 38.6%, 40.0% and 39.6% in the respective periods. Fluctuations in the effective rate are primarily related to foreign taxes which change in accordance with earnings in the Canadian subsidiary and in state tax expenses which have not changed proportionately to income before income taxes.   Liquidity and Capital Resources  The primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and a line of credit with banks. The Company has an unsecured, revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, with an aggregate commitment of up to $50.0 million for working capital and letter of credit purposes. The bank commitment is limited to 45% of eligible inventory. At February 2, 2002, the bank commitment was $40.2 million, and $32.5 million was available for borrowings or additional letters of credit. The credit facility expires June 5, 2002. The Company expects to be able to renew or replace its current facility under similar or more favorable terms upon expiration.  Fiscal 2001  At February 2, 2002, cash and short-term investments were $38.4 million, $16.3 million higher than at February 3, 2001. The primary sources of cash were net income, including non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, and decreases in inventory levels. These sources were partially offset by capital expenditures for store construction and routine equipment purchases.  At February 2, 2002, inventory levels were $15.1 million lower than at the previous year end reflecting the Company's conservative balance sheet management during the second half of the year in light of economic uncertainties and the events of September 11th. The lower inventory levels resulted in less clearance product as of the end of the year and are expected to contribute to improved gross margins and inventory turns for Fiscal 2002. Capital expenditures totaled $14.1 million and included the costs of 32 new stores and the conversion of 18 regular stores to the larger format, as well as continued investments in software and equipment. The capital expenditures program for Fiscal 2002 is planned at approximately $12 million and includes approximately 25 store openings, including 7 outlets and 6 KIDS stores. Additionally, approximately 4 to 6 stores are expected to be converted to the larger format.  Generally, a new or converted store is profitable in its first full year of operations.  The Company's development of its wholesale business and international opportunities are expected to have modest capital requirements during Fiscal 2002. The Company anticipates funding the growth of these initiatives through working capital.  In connection with continuing operations, the Company has various contractual obligations and commercial commitments requiring payment in future periods, summarized in the table below.  The Company did not incur any direct losses or significant expenses in connection with the events of September 11, 2001. However, as a result of those events and the surrounding economic uncertainties, the Company took a conservative approach to managing its balance sheet. Inventory levels were more tightly managed and less new product was introduced during January and February 2002, which may have adversely impacted sales. After the first quarter of Fiscal 2002, inventory receipts are expected to return to more normalized levels and the Company expects the negative trend in same store sales to reverse.   14  The Company believes that its current cash position, cash flows from operations and credit line facilities will be sufficient to fund its current operations and capital expenditures program.

The primary uses of cash were inventory purchases, new store construction and information technology upgrades, as well as purchases of treasury stock. These uses were partially offset by net income, including non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, and by increases in payables.  At February 3, 2001, inventory levels were $14.3 million higher than at January 29, 2000, an increase of 16% compared to an 8% growth in sales. Several factors contributed to this increase. Spring product arrived earlier than in the previous year in order to ensure a good in-stock position for the introduction of the catalog in early March.  Additionally, the timing of Chinese New Year shifted from February to January resulting in more of this season's inventory requirement being shipped just prior to the Company's fiscal year end. Finally, the inventory mix changed with a larger investment in bedroom furniture and a refined furniture assortment, which resulted in higher average price per unit. Capital expenditures totaled $16.7 million and included the costs of 10 new stores and the conversion of 20 regular stores to the larger format, as well as routine purchases of machinery and equipment.  During Fiscal 2000, the Company spent $10.3 million under its stock repurchase program to acquire approximately 3.0 million shares of the Company's common stock.   Critical Accounting Policies  In the course of preparing the financial statements, management makes certain judgments relative to accounting policies that are appropriate in the circumstances and the application of those policies. The following policies are those deemed to be most critical.  Inventory Valuation Policy  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined based upon the weighted average inventory method. Cost is calculated based upon the actual landed cost of an item at the time it is received in the warehouse based upon actual vendor invoices or estimates of costs for which an invoice is not present or for which an allocation of shared costs is required. In addition, the Company includes the cost of warehousing and transporting product to the stores in its costs.  The Company regularly evaluates its compliance with the lower of cost or market principle. Items are evaluated by SKU (stock keeping unit) and to the extent that the cost of the item exceeds the current selling price, provision is made to reduce the carrying cost of the item. Additionally, the Company reviews the aging of its inventory by SKU. The carrying cost of the item is reduced based upon certain age criteria and product category. Since the determination of carrying value of inventory involves both estimation and judgment of cost and market value, differences in these estimates could result in valuations that vary from the recorded asset.   15  Each month, the Company records an allowance for shrinkage to provide for the cost of lost or stolen inventory. The amount of the allowance is determined based upon the historical shrinkage results and is adjusted at least annually to reflect current circumstances.  Inventory is physically counted at all locations at least once each year, at which time actual results are reflected in the financial statements. Physical counts were taken at all stores and the distribution centers during January 2002.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Long-lived assets are reviewed at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. This review includes the evaluation of individual under - -performing retail stores and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of the fixed assets related to the store. Future cash flows are projected for the remaining lease life considering such factors as future sales levels, gross margins, changes in rent and other expenses as well as the overall operating environment specific to that store. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, a charge is recorded to write down the cost of the assets. Since the projection of future cash flows involves judgment and estimates, differences in circumstances or estimates could produce different results.  During Fiscal 2002, the Company will adopt the provisions of Statement of Accounting Standards No.144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long- Lived Assets ("FAS 144"). FAS 144 modifies previous guidance on the impairment of long-lived assets. Among other provisions, it permits the use of a probability-weighted estimation approach in evaluating future cash flows for a group of assets. The impact of the adoption of FAS 144 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Deferred Taxes  The Company currently has recorded $9.7 million of deferred tax assets representing the difference between the timing of deductions taken for financial statement purposes and for tax purposes. Underlying the assumption that the benefit of those assets will be recoverable in some future period is the concept that the Company will have future taxable income. If future conditions indicate that the benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized, a valuation allowance will be recorded to reduce the assets to their estimated realizable value.  Insurance  The Company is self-insured with respect to medical and dental insurance coverage offered to its eligible employees, up to a maximum of $125,000 per claim. Above that amount, medical insurance coverage is in place. In connection with the self-insured portion, the Company maintains a liability for claims that are in the process of being paid and those that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company's insurance carrier. The amount of the liability is estimated based upon historical claims experience and upon information provided by the Company's independent benefits broker regarding other similar insurance programs. At February 2, 2002, the balance of the medical and dental liability was $1.4 million.  Beginning in Fiscal 2001, the Company also maintains workers' compensation insurance coverage with a deductible of $100,000 per claim. At February 2, 2002, the Company has a liability of $644,000 representing the estimated amount that will have to be paid in future periods related to the settlement of claims under the insurance policy. The amount of the liability reflects expected remaining workers' compensation claims based upon historical claims experience and other information obtained by the Company, including projections made by the underwriters of the Company's insurance carrier. As these claims are paid, the liability will be reduced. Furthermore, the liability will be adjusted if circumstances change or if information becomes available that would indicate that the future payments would be different than what was previously estimated. Prior to Fiscal 2001, the Company's workers' compensation insurance was not subject to a deductible.  Since the amounts recorded for insurance liabilities are based upon various estimates, actual future requirements could vary from the recorded liabilities.     16  ITEM 7A.
