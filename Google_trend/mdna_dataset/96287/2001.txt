ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS.  General  The Bombay Company, Inc. ("Company" or "Bombay") is a specialty retailer which markets timeless and classic furniture, wall decor and accessories through 408 Bombay retail stores in 42 states in the United States and nine Canadian provinces, through mail order and over the internet at www.bombaycompany.com.  The Company has announced its intention to develop other business opportunities outside of its core operations. Bailey Street Trading Company represents the Company's wholesale operations, introduced in Fiscal 2000. In addition, the Company plans to expand the Bombay brand abroad through licensing and distribution agreements with local partners in various markets. Finally, the Company has recently announced the launch of Bombay Kids, its new line of children's room furnishings, to be offered in Fall 2001 through catalog and internet only.  The largest percentage of the Company's sales and operating income is realized in the fiscal quarter that includes December (Christmas season). Merchandise is manufactured to Company specification through a network of contract manufacturers located principally in Asia and North America. Because the majority of the Company's products are proprietary, the impact of inflation on operating results is typically not significant. The Company attempts to alleviate inflationary pressures by increasing selling prices (subject to competitive conditions), improving designs and finding alternative production sources in lower cost countries.

Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, the following: competition; seasonality; success of operating initiatives; new product development and introduction schedules; acceptance of new product offerings; advertising and promotional efforts; adverse publicity; expansion of the store chain; availability, locations and terms of sites for store development; changes in business strategy or development plans; availability and terms of capital; labor and employee benefit costs; changes in government regulations; risks associated with international business and regional weather conditions.  Net Sales  Fiscal 2000  Net sales increased $30.6 million, or 8%, to $421.5 million, compared to $390.9 million in Fiscal 1999. Sales increases were attributable to a 5% increase in same store sales (stores in existence for one year or more). A 53rd week in Fiscal 2000 added less than 2% to the total sales increase. Sales increases were also realized with the opening of 10 new stores during the year and the conversion of another 20 regular stores to the larger store format. These increases were partially offset by the closure of 17 stores which were either underperforming or at the end of their lease lives. On a net basis, the number of stores decreased from 415 at the end of Fiscal 1999 to 408 at the end of Fiscal 2000, including 291 large stores, 93 regular stores and 24 outlet stores, while total retail square footage increased approximately 2.5%.  Sales growth was fairly consistent across all categories with the product mix remaining virtually unchanged. Sales in Fiscal 2000 consisted of 45% furniture, 41% accessories and 14% wall decor (principally prints, mirrors and sconces). In Fiscal 1999 the product mix was 45% furniture, 40% accessories and 15% wall decor. The number of transactions increased by 9% and the average ticket remained virtually unchanged at $79.  Same store sales gains were strongest in the Company's Canadian subsidiary, with other strong performances in the western and northeastern portions of the U.S. All regions reported positive or flat same store sales. Outlets also performed well driven by the continued infusion of outlet only merchandise.                                          11    12     Fiscal 1999  The Company recorded net sales of $390.9 million, an increase of $34.2 million or 10% over net sales of $356.7 million in Fiscal 1998. The increase is due to a 5% increase in same store sales as well as a slight increase in the number of stores opened. During the year, the Company opened 19 new stores and converted another 11 regular stores to the larger format store. These increases were partially offset by the closure of 16 underperforming stores, most of which were at the end of their lease lives. As a result, the number of stores increased from 412 stores at the end of Fiscal 1998 to 415 stores at the end of Fiscal 1999, including 270 large stores, 125 regular stores and 20 outlet stores. In addition, during Fiscal 1999, the Company remodeled and/or remerchandised another 30 stores in a style similar to the new store design introduced late in Fiscal 1997.  From a product mix standpoint, the sales increases were primarily related to the increased focus on accessories and impulse items, designed to attract more customers and grow the Company's customer base. While furniture remained the core of the business, the emphasis on accessories somewhat shifted the sales mix in Fiscal 1999 compared to Fiscal 1998. In Fiscal 1999, furniture represented 45% of the sales, accessories were 40% and wall decor was 15%. In Fiscal 1998, furniture represented 50% of the sales, accessories were 35% and wall decor was 15%. Consistent with the emphasis on accessories, the number of transactions increased 23% over the previous year and the average ticket decreased 10% to $79.  On a regional basis, there was little variation in same store sales with the exception of the northeastern part of the U.S., which experienced a slight decline. The same store sales increase in outlets was above the Company average as more outlet specific merchandise purchases were made. During this period, the mix of product in the outlets was approximately 60% special purchase and 40% clearance and overstock from the primary chain.  COST OF SALES, BUYING AND STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS  Fiscal 2000  Cost of sales, including buying and store occupancy costs, was $291.7 million or 69.2% of sales. As a percentage of sales, these costs decreased from 70.0% of sales in Fiscal 1999. Product margins improved 20 basis points from the prior year due to an improved product mix and good in-stock positions of key merchandise, more than offsetting higher distribution center and domestic freight costs. Buying and occupancy costs declined 60 basis points to 19.6% of sales while increasing $3.4 million. The higher dollar costs were primarily driven by investments in new stores and technology. The improvement in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales is due to the relatively fixed nature of these costs measured against a higher sales base.  Fiscal 1999  Cost of sales, including buying and store occupancy costs, was $273.5 million or 70.0% of sales. As a percentage of sales, these costs decreased from 70.9% of sales in Fiscal 1998. Product margins improved 70 basis points over the prior year primarily due to higher margins in all categories except furniture, which was down slightly. Improved merchandise selection and more selective promotions were the key reasons for the improvement. Buying and occupancy costs declined to 20.2% of sales from 20.4% of sales while increasing $6.1 million. The higher costs were primarily the results of higher rents and related costs on a 3% increase in overall store square footage, and higher depreciation costs associated with the new construction, additional store fixtures and the new point of sale system. The decline in buying and occupancy as a percentage of sales is due to the relatively fixed nature of the costs measured against a higher sales base.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  Fiscal 2000  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $116.0 million, an increase of $9.7 million or 9%, compared to $106.3 million in Fiscal 1999. The largest component of the dollar increase is higher payroll and related costs. However, as a percentage of sales these costs remain relatively constant. The Company's investments in infrastructure and technology have also contributed to higher selling, general and administrative expenses with increased depreciation, amortization and related costs. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased slightly, from 27.2% in Fiscal 1999 to 27.5% in Fiscal 2000.  Fiscal 1999  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $106.3 million, an increase of $7.4 million or 8%, compared to $98.9 million in Fiscal 1998. The dollar increase resulted primarily from higher payroll and payroll related costs. Store payroll cost increases were driven by higher store pay rates in the tight labor market while performance based compensation increased due to the Company's improved operating results. Although expenses increased in dollars, as a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses declined from 27.7% to 27.2% due largely to                                          12    13  economies of scale realized in advertising, leveraging other fixed costs against the higher sales base and continued controls over expenses.  INTEREST  Fiscal 2000  The Company had interest income slightly less than $1.0 million and interest expense of $.4 million, compared to interest income of $1.1 million and interest expense of less than $.1 million in Fiscal 1999. The changes in these amounts are due to lower average cash balances and greater utilization of seasonal borrowings in the current year to support the Company's investments in store expansion, infrastructure and technology, the stock repurchase program and higher inventory levels.  Fiscal 1999  Interest income was $1.1 million compared to $1.9 million in Fiscal 1998. The decline in interest income was due primarily to lower average cash balances resulting primarily from higher average inventory levels than in Fiscal 1998. In addition, $8.5 million of cash was used to repurchase Company stock during the year. In Fiscal 1999, the Company had less than $.1 million interest expense incurred on temporary seasonal borrowings used to support higher inventory levels in preparation for the Christmas sales season.  INCOME TAXES  The Company provided income taxes of $5.8 million, $4.8 million and $2.8 million in Fiscal 2000, Fiscal 1999 and Fiscal 1998, respectively. The effective rates were 40.0%, 39.6% and 41.0% in the respective periods. Fluctuations in the effective rate are primarily related to foreign taxes which change in accordance with earnings in the Canadian subsidiary and in state tax expenses which have not changed proportionately to income before income taxes.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and bank lines of credit. Bank borrowings are available to fund seasonal working capital requirements. In addition, the bank credit lines are used for overseas merchandise purchases. Unsecured bank lines aggregate $45 million, of which $30 million are committed under revolving credit agreements expiring May 12, 2001. Negotiations are currently underway to renew or replace the credit lines. Management expects to complete these negotiations on satisfactory terms before the current agreements expire.  Fiscal 2000  As of February 3, 2001, cash and short-term investments were $22.2 million, a decrease of $17.0 million from January 29, 2000. The primary uses of cash were inventory purchases, new store construction and information technology upgrades, as well as purchases of treasury stock. These uses were partially offset by net income, including non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, and by increases in payables.  At February 3, 2001, inventory levels were $14.3 million higher than at January 29, 2000, an increase of 16% compared to an 8% growth in sales. Several factors contributed to this increase. Spring product arrived earlier than last year in order to ensure a good in-stock position for the introduction of the catalog in early March. Additionally, the timing of Chinese New Year shifted from February to January resulting in more of this season's inventory requirement being shipped just prior to the Company's fiscal year end. Finally, the inventory mix changed with a larger investment in bedroom furniture and a refined furniture assortment, which resulted in higher average price per unit. The inventory consists primarily of new merchandise, with less than 10% of the merchandise being clearance product. Based upon the freshness of the inventory, management does not expect to take unusual markdowns in order to sell through the product and expects inventories to return to more normal levels by the end of the second quarter.  Capital expenditures totaled $16.7 million and included the costs of 10 new stores and the conversion of 20 regular stores to the larger format, as well as continued investments in software and equipment. The capital expenditures program for Fiscal 2001 is planned at approximately $19 million and includes 30 to 35 stores openings, including 8 to 10 outlets. Additionally, 15 to 20 stores are expected to be converted to the larger format. Generally, a new or converted store is profitable in its first full year of operations.  The Company has in place a stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors of up to $30 million. During Fiscal 2000, the Company spent $10.3 million under the program to acquire approximately 3.0 million shares of the Company's common stock. From the inception of the program through February 3, 2001, $25.0 million has been spent to repurchase approximately 6.0 million shares. The Company does not currently have plans to purchase additional shares during Fiscal 2001.                                           13    14  The Company's development of its wholesale business, international opportunities and children's room furnishings line are expected to have modest capital requirements during Fiscal 2001. The Company anticipates funding the growth of these initiatives through working capital.  The Company believes that its current cash position, cash flows from operations and credit line facilities will be sufficient to fund its current operations and capital expenditures program.  Fiscal 1999  At January 29, 2000, cash and short-term investments were $39.2 million, a decrease of $13.6 million from January 30, 1999. The primarily uses of cash were inventory purchases, expansion of the store base and information technology upgrades as well as purchases of treasury stock. These uses were partially offset by net income including non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, and by increases in payable.  At January 29, 2000, inventory levels were $16.2 million higher than at the same time the prior year. During Fiscal 1999, the Company made the decision to bring in approximately $5 million of inventory early as insurance against possible supply chain disruptions related to Year 2000 issues. Much of this product was included in inventory as of the end of the year. The increase was also reflective of the higher sales level and the increase focus on accessories.  Capital expenditures totaled $18.0 million and included the costs of 19 new stores and the conversion of 11 regular stores to the larger format. The 1999 capital expenditures also included approximately $6.6 million spent on the replacement of store point of sale equipment, as well as purchases of additional store fixtures and routine purchases of equipment.  During Fiscal 1999, the Company spent $8.5 million under its stock repurchase program to acquire, through open market transactions, approximately 1.8 million shares of the Company's common stock.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT  Effective February 4, 2001, the Company will adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("FAS 133"). FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments including, among other things, forward currency exchange contracts. However, due to the Company's limited use of derivative financial instruments, adoption of FAS 133 will not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.                                              14    15     ITEM 7A.
