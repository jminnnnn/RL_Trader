Since November 2002, AMIC has been affiliated with Independence Holding Company ("IHC"), which owns 39% of AMIC's stock, and IHC's senior management has provided direction to the Company through a service agreement between the Company and IHC.  IHC has also entered into long-term reinsurance treaties to cede medical stop-loss business to Independence American.    While management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning, the overriding consideration is underwriting profitability.  Management's assessment of trends in healthcare and in the medical stop-loss market play a significant role in determining whether to expand Independence American's reinsurance participation percentage or the number of programs it reinsures.  Since Independence American reinsures a portion of all of the business produced by the MGUs, and since the MGUs are also eligible to earn profit sharing commissions based on the profitability of the business they write, the MGUs also emphasize underwriting profitability.  In addition, management focuses on controlling operating costs.  By sharing employees with IHC and sharing resources among the MGUs and Independence American, AMIC strives to maximize its earnings and utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards of over $287 million.   The following are highlights in 2003 for Independence American and the MGU subsidiaries:   Independence American Insurance Company      Statutory Capital and Surplus as determined under statutory accounting principles of over $27.2 million; this is an increase of $4.8 million or 21.3% from the previous year.      Premiums increased to $37.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2003 from $6.9 million in the year ended 2002.      $46.8 million of assets; 75% increase from December 31, 2002.      Beginning in 2004, average percentage of medical stop-loss business ceded from IHC to Independence American has increased to 18.5%.        90.2% of invested assets in bonds and short-term investments, 97% of the bonds have the highest NAIC rating designation (NAIC ratings of 1 and 2 designation).      Employer Medical Stop-Loss policy approved in 15 states and Provider Excess Loss policy approved in 13 states.   MGU Division (IndependenceCare, Marlton, RAS)     Acquired 80% interest in Marlton Risk Group, the largest medical   stop-loss MGU doing business with Standard Life.         In 2003, our MGUs wrote an aggregate of $135 million of annualized gross premium, and generated   pre-tax income of $6.8 million.     History   Until April 2002, the Company (then known as SoftNet Systems, Inc.) was an Internet service provider.  Due to difficult and deteriorating conditions in that market, the Company discontinue this business.  In December 2000, the Company's board of directors approved a plan to discontinue the operations of its subsidiary, ISP Channel, Inc., which had provided cable-based Internet access and related services, and the operations of another subsidiary, Aerzone Corporation, which provided Internet and related services at airports.  In April 2002, the Company ceased operations of its remaining operating subsidiary, Intelligent Communications, Inc., following the disposition of its key assets.  In connection with the Company's exit from the Internet provider business, it undertook a process of consideration of strategic alternatives for the Company.  The results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2001, have been reclassified for the effects of discontinued operations of Intellicom.            On July 30, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire First Standard Holdings Corp. ("FSHC") from SSH Corp. and Independence Holding Company ("IHC") for $31,920,000 in cash.  As described below, FSHC was the holding company for an insurance company and two managing general underwriters ("MGUs"). Subsequently at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on November 14, 2002, the Company's stockholders approved the stock purchase agreement between the Company, SSH Corp. and IHC (the "Purchase Agreement"), and approved the Company's name change to American Independence Corp. Also on November 14, 2002, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and FSHC changed its name to Independence American Holdings Corp. ("IAHC").  Following this acquisition, the Company closed its offices in San Francisco, terminated all but two of its employees, and entered into a services agreement with IHC pursuant to which the Company's operations are directed by IHC's management and employees.    In a separate transaction on July 30, 2002, IHC acquired Pacific Century Cyberworks Limited's ("PCCW") entire interest in the Company consisting of 1,666,666 shares of common stock at $9.00 per share for a total value of $15,000,000. As a result of this transaction, PCCW's two appointees resigned from the Company's Board of Directors, and Edward Netter, Chairman of IHC, and Roy T.K. Thung, President and Chief Executive Officer of IHC, were appointed to the Company's Board of Directors.  On April 22, 2003, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IHC completed its tender for one million shares of the common stock of the Company at $9.00 per share for a total value of $9,000.000.  On December 22, 2003, IHC purchased an aggregate of 613,401 shares in the market and private transactions.  As a result of these transactions, IHC and its subsidiary own 39% of the Company.   On February 10, 2003, but effective as of January 1, 2003, the Company acquired 80% of the business of an employer medical stop-loss MGU and an affiliated entity (the "Acquired MGUs").  The acquisition was accomplished by the formation of Voorhees Risk Management LLC d.b.a. Marlton Risk Group ("Marlton") into which the Acquired MGUs contributed all of their assets, and the Company contributed $16,000,000 cash for an 80% ownership interest.  The Company's cash contribution was then distributed to the Acquired MGUs together with the remaining 20% interest in Marlton, and Marlton assumed all of the liabilities of the Acquired MGUs.     As of December 31, 2003, the Company had substantially completed the wind down of its Internet services related subsidiaries, ISP Channel, Intellicom, and Aerzone, including Laptop Lane Limited ("Laptop Lane"), as a result of the following:  On December 7, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to discontinue its ISP Channel operations because of (1) the consolidation in the cable industry made it difficult for ISP Channel to achieve the economies of scale necessary to provide such services profitably, and (2) the Company was no longer able to bear the costs of maintaining the ISP Channel.  On March 29, 2002, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Intellicom, entered into an agreement to sell its operating business and certain assets to Loral Cyberstar, Inc.  Following the sale of its operating business and certain assets to Loral Cyberstar, Inc., the Company's Board of Directors unanimously agreed to cease the operations of Intellicom on April 3, 2002.          CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The preparation of consolidated financials statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated   financial statements of the Company appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.  Discontinued Operations  The Company accounts for discontinued operations in accordance to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 ("APB 30"),  Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.  Under APB 30, the Company accrued estimates of expected liabilities related to discontinued operations through its eventual discharge. The estimated remaining liabilities related to discontinued operations include contract terminations, litigation and loss from operations subsequent to September 30, 2002. The Company reviews the estimated closure costs liability on a quarterly basis to determine changes in the costs of the discontinued operations activities.  Income Taxes  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers   whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary difference become deductible.  Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.  Management believes that although sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, the valuation allowance has been adjusted to account for the expected utilization of net operating losses against future taxable income. 	The Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes available to reduce future income subject to income taxes.  The net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2009 and 2023.    U.S. federal and California tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an "ownership change" for tax purposes, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. For tax purposes, an ownership change occurred during 1999 and, as a result, utilization of the net operating losses arising prior to 1999 will be subject to an annual limitation in future years.  Goodwill  	In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives resulting from business combinations will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). In the event that the management of the Company determines that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives has become impaired, the Company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.  Premium and MGU Fee Income Revenue Recognition   Premiums from short-duration contracts will be recognized as revenue over the period of the contracts in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided.  The Company records MGU fee income as policy premium payments are earned.  MGUs are compensated in two ways.  They earn fee income based on the volume of business produced, and collect profit-sharing commissions if such business exceeds certain profitability benchmarks. Profit-sharing commissions are accounted for beginning in the period in which the Company believes they are reasonably estimable. While profit-sharing commissions are a function of an MGU attaining certain profitability thresholds and could greatly vary from quarter to quarter, AMIC's MGUs price their business to an anticipated profit margin in excess of such thresholds.   Investments    The Company accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS 115"),  Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.  The Company has classified all of its investments as available-for-sale securities.  These investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and are reported in net realized gains, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  Declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as net realized gains.   Reserves   Liabilities for insurance policy benefits on short-term medical coverages were computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data.  These methods are widely used in the health insurance industry to estimate the liabilities for insurance policy benefits. Inherent in these calculations are management and actuarial judgments and estimates (within industry standards) which could significantly impact the ending reserve liabilities and, consequently, operating results.  Actual results may differ, and these estimates are subject to interpretation and change.  Management believes that the Company's method of estimating the liabilities for insurance policy benefits provides an adequate level of reserves at December 31, 2003.  Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2003, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2002   Due to the acquisition of the insurance operations of IAHC, certain line items only appear in the fiscal 2003 and in the quarter ended December 31, 2002 Consolidated Statement of Operations.   Premiums Earned .   The Company earned $37,817,000 of premiums on insurance business of Independence American for fiscal 2003.   Net Investment Income.  Net investment income increased $237,000 to $1,967,000 for fiscal 2003, compared to $1,730,000 for fiscal 2002, mainly due to a higher yield from investments in fixed maturities in 2003.  Investment income in 2002, although based on greater assets, was at a lower yield due to the shorter duration of the investments.   Net Realized Gains.  The Company realized net gains of $330,000 from sales of its investments for fiscal 2003.  Decisions to sell securities are based on cash flow needs, investment opportunities, and economic and market conditions, thus creating fluctuations in gains or losses from period to period.   MGU Fee Income.  The Company earned $15,427,000 of fee income from its MGUs for fiscal 2003.  Of this amount $2,619,000 relates to MGU profit sharing revenues.   Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $12,406,000 to   $19,724,000 for fiscal 2003, compared to $7,318,000 for fiscal 2002. The increase is primarily due to commission expense recorded by Independence American and operating expenses from the MGUs.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the 3 MGUs were $7,882,000 and commission expense for Independence American was $10,660,000 for fiscal 2003.   Insurance Benefits, Claims and Reserves.   Insurance benefits, claims and reserves amounted to $23,312,000 related to the premiums earned by Independence American for fiscal 2003.  Amortization and Depreciation.  Amortization and depreciation expense increased $1,822,000 to $2,011,000 for fiscal 2003, compared to $189,000 for fiscal 2002.  The expense for fiscal 2003 mainly relates to the amortization of the intangible assets for the value of broker/TPA relationships of the MGUs. These intangible assets were acquired as part of the acquisitions of IAHC and Marlton.   Non-Cash Compensation Expense Related to Stock Options.  The Company recognized non-cash compensation expense related to stock options of $141,000 for fiscal 2003.  This expense relates to the fair value of options issued in 2003 accounted for under SFAS No. 123.  The expense for fiscal 2002 of $1,466,000 relates to options accounted for under APB 25.   Income Taxes.   The Company had a benefit of income taxes of $2,993,000 for fiscal 2003.  This includes a benefit of $4,466,000 due to a reduction of the valuation allowance.  In 2003, the Company further reduced the valuation allowance relating to the deferred tax asset, which caused a corresponding increase in such deferred tax asset.  The valuation allowance relates to the possibility that AMIC might not be able to fully utilize its prior tax year federal net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs").  AMIC periodically reviews the valuation allowance to determine the reasonableness of the amount, and previously reduced it in connection with the Company's acquisitions in 2002 and 2003.  Based upon AMIC's profitability in 2003 and projected continuing profitable results, it was management's view that it was appropriate to further reduce the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2003, which resulted in an increase in net income and income from continuing operations.     The Company's tax year end is September 30, and, for the first nine months of 2003, AMIC had a recovery for federal income taxes arising from losses in the fourth quarter of 2002.  These losses were fully applied, and the Company began to utilize its NOLs, in the fourth quarter of 2003.  As long as AMIC utilizes these NOLs, it will not pay any income taxes, except for federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes.  In the first nine months of 2003, AMIC did not have any provision for federal income taxes on its income statement due to losses arising in the fourth quarter of 2002.  Starting in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company had a provision for federal income taxes of $920,000 on its income statement, and the utilization of its NOLs reduced the deferred tax asset on its balance sheet.   The Company also had a provision for state income taxes of $504,000 for fiscal 2003.   Provision for Impaired Assets. The Company recognized a charge of $352,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, as a result of writing off its accounting software. In light of its reduced operations, the Company changed to an off-the-shelf accounting software.   Restructuring Expense. The Company recognized a restructuring charge for the year ended September 30, 2001, related to the downsizing of its corporate headquarters' staff. The charge in the amount of $3,900,000 was recognized as restructuring expense and primarily consisted of termination payments for affected employees. The Company increased the restructuring reserve by $152,000 for fiscal 2003 and $502,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, respectively, as a result of additional estimated lease termination costs associated with Company's headquarters.  At December 31, 2003 and September 30, 2002, a restructuring accrual of $866,000 and $1,446,000, respectively, remained outstanding.   Loss on Equity Investments. The Company recognized a loss on disposition of equity investments of $733,000 for fiscal 2002, consisting of $253,000 related to 1,000,000 SkyNet Global Limited common stock shares and $480,000 related to the 400,000 SkyNet Global Limited preference stock shares.    Gain (Loss) Attributed to Discontinued Operations. The Company recognized a $110,000 gain on discontinued operations for fiscal 2003, compared to a $5,926,000 loss attributed to discontinued operations for fiscal 2002.  For the year ended September 30, 2002, the loss attributed to discontinued operations consisted of a $3,120,000 loss on disposition of Interlace, a $1,829,000 loss from operations of Intellicom, a $1,127,000 loss on disposition of Micrographic Technology Corporation ("MTC"), as a result of a preliminary arbitration decision related to a dispute with Applications Informatiques Multimedia and a dispute related to the sale of MTC to Global Information Distribution GmbH, a $900,000 gain on disposition of ISP Channel, resulting from the lower than anticipated costs of closing ISP Channel, and a $750,000 loss on disposition of Aerzone, resulting from a court decision related to a breach of contract and other legal matters.  The gain of $110,000 in 2003 is primarily attributable to lower than expected interest and expenses with regard to an arbitration award, substantially offset by additional reserves on Intellicom related to the lease obligations of the Livermore facility due to difficulty in subletting the facility as compared to original expectations.     Net Income/Loss. The Company had net income of $12,671,000, or $1.50 per share, diluted, for fiscal 2003, compared to a net loss of $14,756,000, or a net loss per share of $1.76, diluted, for the year ended September 30, 2002.

Net investment income decreased $4,584,000 to $1,730,000 for fiscal 2002, compared to $6,314,000 for fiscal 2001, as a result of lower interest rates, a decrease in cash and cash equivalent, and short-term investments.  Selling, General and Administrative.    Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2,698,000 to $7,318,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, compared to $10,016,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001, primarily due to staff reductions associated with the December 28, 2000 corporate restructuring plan.  Amortization and Deprecation.  Amortization and depreciation decreased $161,000 to $189,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, compared to $350,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001, primarily due to sales and disposal of property.

For the year ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, non-cash compensation expense/benefit related to stock options issued to employees primarily relates to the amortization of deferred stock compensation resulting from below market value stock options granted between October 1998 and March 1999, accounted for under APB 25.   Provision for Impaired Assets. The Company recognized a charge of $352,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, as a result of writing off its accounting software.

Income Taxes.  The Company made no provision for federal income taxes for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, as a result of the Company's continuing losses.  For the quarter ended December 31, 2003,  the Company recorded a $1,000 provision for state and local taxes attributed to IAHC.   Loss from Discontinued Operations.  As a result of the decision by the Board of Directors to discontinue the operations of Intellicom on March 29, 2002, the loss on operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2001 of $928,000 has been reclassified as loss from discontinued operations.   Loss on Disposition. Loss on disposition increased $885,000 to $1,475,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, compared to $590,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2001. The loss is primarily attributable to an arbitration award on MTC, a settlement on Aerzone, and additional reserves on Intellicom related to the lease obligations of the Livermore facility.   Net Loss.  The Company had a net loss of $7,052,000, or a net loss per share of $0.84, for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, compared to a net loss of $2,780,000, or a net loss per share of $0.33, for the three months ended December 31, 2001.  There was no gain or loss from discontinued operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2001.    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 was $14,713,000.  This results from net income of $12,671,000, a gain of $110,000 from discontinued operations and a net decrease in the remaining assets and liabilities of $2,152,000 which includes several non-cash items including stock compensation expense of $141,000, realized gains of $330,000 and amortization and depreciation expense of $2,011,000.  Net cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was $2,960,000.   	Net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 was $17,106,000.  This use of cash results from the acquisition of Marlton for $16,102,000, and net cash used of $1,002,000 from purchases of all other investments, net of purchases.     	Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 was $132,000, resulting from the exercise of common stock options.   	The Company believes it has sufficient cash to meet its presently anticipated business requirements over the next twelve months including the funding of discontinued operations, working capital requirements, and capital investments.      LIQUIDITY   The Company normally generates cash flow from (i) operations; (ii) the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed income securities; and (iii) earnings on investments.  Such cash flow is partially used to finance liabilities for insurance policy benefits.  These liabilities represent long-term and short-term obligations that are calculated using certain assumed interest rates.   Asset Quality      The nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders.  Of the aggregate carrying value of the Company's investment assets, approximately 99% was invested in investment grade fixed income securities, resale agreements, policy loans and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003.  Also at such date, approximately 97% of the Company's fixed maturities were investment grade.  These investments carry less default risk and, therefore, lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments.  At December 31, 2003, approximately 3% of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in diversified non-investment grade fixed income securities.   Investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities, including greater risk of loss upon default, and thinner trading markets.  The Company does not have any non-performing fixed maturities.      Investment Impairments   The Company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments.  The Company's gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled $401,000 at December 31, 2003. Substantially all of these securities were investment grade. The remaining unrealized losses have been evaluated in accordance with the Company's policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at December 31, 2003. The Company holds all securities as available-for-sale and accordingly marks all of its securities to market through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).       Risk Management     	The Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities. Options may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets.   The following summarizes the estimated pre-tax change in fair value (based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the U.S. Treasury yield curve) of the fixed income portfolio assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at December 31, 2003:                  Estimated  Fair         Estimated   Change    Change in Interest Rates            Value         In Fair Value                (in millions)    200 basis point rise         $   27.7         (3.3)    100 basis point rise            29.4         (1.6)    Base scenario            31.0         -    100 basis point decline            32.4         1.4    200 basis point decline            34.0         3.0        	 The Company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the Company will not be adversely affected by its current investments.    In the Company's analysis of the asset-liability model, a 100 to 200 basis point change in interest rates on the Company's liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company. With respect to its investments, the Company employs (from time to time as warranted) investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures.      Balance Sheet   Total investments decreased $2,652,000 to $38,258,000 at December 31, 2003 from $40,910,000 at September 30, 2002, largely due to the use of cash to acquire Marlton, particularly offset by the growth in business 2003.  The $17,858,000 increase in insurance policy benefits reflects growth in the business. The $6,463,000 increase in total stockholders' equity is mainly due to net income generated in the three months ended December 31, 2002 and during fiscal 2003.   	The Company had net receivables from reinsurers of $4,299,000 at December 31, 2003.  Substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration.  All of such receivables are either due from highly rated companies or are adequately secured.  No allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary at December 31, 2003.     CAPITAL RESOURCES   Due to its strong capital ratio and excellent asset quality and credit-worthiness, the Company remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities. It is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity. In the event additional funds are required, it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable   The Company has expected contractual obligations relating to non-cancelable leases of the following at December 31, 2003:      Year Ending December 31:                                               2004               $   1,051       2005                  852       2006                  419       2007                  428       2008                  232       2009 and after                  512    Total               $   3,494       Under certain circumstances set forth in the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Marlton, the Company has the right and/or obligation to purchase some or all of the minority interests in Marlton.    In accordance with SFAS No. 115, the Company may carry its portfolio of fixed income securities either as held to maturity (carried at amortized cost), as trading securities (carried at fair value) or as available-for-sale (carried at fair value).  The Company has chosen to carry all of its debt securities as available-for-sale.  The Company experienced a change in net unrealized loss of $ 60,000, reflecting net unrealized loss of $66,000 at December 31, 2003 from net unrealized losses of $6,000 at September 30, 2002.  From time to time, as warranted, the Company employs investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures.     OUTLOOK   Independence American, which is domiciled in Delaware, is licensed to write property and/or casualty insurance in 24 states. Currently, Independence American reinsures medical stop-loss produced by IHC and other carriers.  Independence American has entered into reinsurance treaties with Standard Life and Madison Life which run through December 31, 2014, under which Independence American receives at least 15% of their medical stop-loss business. Standard Life and Madison Life have increased the amount ceded to Independence American under several programs in 2004.   Independence American is also positioning itself to be an issuing carrier of medical stop-loss.  Currently, it has approved employer medical stop-loss policies in 15 states and approved provider excess loss policies in 13 states. Independence American anticipates writing more provider business in 2004.  Independence American is actively seeking more licenses and product approvals, and has also positioned itself to be an issuing carrier of employer medical stop loss at the appropriate time (through the AMIC MGUs and otherwise) to augment its reinsurance operations.   Independence American is already IHC's largest reinsurer, and will become even larger in 2004.    Independence American, which has been licensed in New York for many years, is also filing policies in order to write a short-term statutory disability benefit product ("DBL") in New York.   New Accounting Pronouncements   In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity"  which requires an issuer of mandatory redeemable financial instruments to classify such instruments as a liability and to measure such liability at its present value, using the rate implicit at the inception of the contract. In addition, all future dividends paid to holders of those instruments are to be reflected as interest cost. As originally issued, SFAS No. 150 was effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 for financial instruments that were in existence prior to May 31, 2003. However, the effective date of the statement's provisions related to the classification and measurement of certain mandatory non-controlling interests has been deferred indefinitely by the FASB, pending further Board action. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 150, transition is achieved by reporting the difference (if any) between the measurement of the liability upon adoption and the previous carrying value as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have any effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements                 In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under Statement 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The provisions of SFAS No. 149 are to be applied prospectively. Provisions that relate to Statement 133 implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters than began prior to June 15, 2003, should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.     In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which addresses costs associated with an exit activity (including restructuring) or with disposal of long-lived assets. Under SFAS No. 146, companies are required to record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value. The new requirements are effective prospectively for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45").  This interpretation requires that certain disclosures be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantees, effective for financial statements for periods ending after December 15, 2002.  FIN 45 also requires the recognition, at fair value, of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2003.  The disclosure and recognition requirements did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.     In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised),  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  ("FIN 46R"), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and, accordingly, should consolidate the variable interest entity ("VIE").  FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46 that was issued in January 2003.  The Company is required to apply FIN 46R to special-purpose entities as of December 31, 2003 and to other VIEs no later than as of March 31, 2004.  For any VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that were created before January 1, 2004, the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest of the VIE initially would be measured at their carrying amounts, and any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest would be recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change.  The adoption of FIN 46R as of December 31, 2003 did not have a material impact on the Company.  The Company held no interests in VIEs that were required to be consolidated under FIN 46R as of December 31, 2003.   From time to time, information provided by the Company, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on behalf of the Company, may contain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company's control, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.  Set forth below are important factors that could cause the Company's results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company's business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company's common stock could decline.  COMPANY RISKS  IHC Will Exercise Significant Influence Over the Company's Business and Affairs, Which May Result in Potential Conflicts of Interest Between IHC and the Company; Reliance on IHC's Expertise  The Company's operations are being directed by IHC management and employees, which may result in potential conflicts of interest between IHC and the Company.  For example, a conflict may arise if IHC were to engage in activities or pursue corporation opportunities that overlap with the Company's business.  Because IHC's management will also constitute the Company's management, these individuals will have fiduciary duties to both companies, which could result in conflicts of interest, including the Company foregoing opportunities or taking actions that disproportionately benefit IHC.  IHC will also have at least two representatives on the Company's Board of Directors who will have similar conflicts of interest.  In addition, the Company is relying upon the management and expertise of officers of IHC who also serve as officers of the Company.  The Occurrence of Various Events May Adversely Affect the Company's Ability to Utilize Fully Its Tax Net Operating Loss Carryforwards.  The Company has U.S. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $287 million, which may be used against any profits from the Company's business.  However, events outside of the control of the Company or IHC, such as certain acquisitions and dispositions of the Company's common stock, may limit the use of all or a portion of the Company's tax net operating loss carryforwards.  If such events were to occur, the Company's expectation of using its tax net operating loss carryforwards against potential profits would not be realized and the Company could potentially have a higher tax liability in the future than it would otherwise have had.  Results May Fluctuate as a Result of Factors Generally Affecting the Insurance and Reinsurance Industry  The results of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties.  Factors that affect the industry in general could also cause results to fluctuate.  The industry's and the Company's financial condition and results of operations may be affected significantly by:      Fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment, which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of loss amounts;  Rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products;  Events like the September 11, 2001 attacks, which affected the insurance and reinsurance markets generally;  Changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise an the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of   insurers' liability; and  The overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry.    Decrease in Rates for Accident and Health Reinsurance and Insurance Could Reduce Net Income  Independence American, the Company's insurance subsidiary, primarily reinsures accident and health insurance.  Rates for accident and health insurance and reinsurance are influenced primarily by factors that are outside of Independence American's control and historically have been highly cyclical.  Any significant decrease in the rates for accident and health insurance or reinsurance could reduce the Company's net income.  If the Rating Agencies Downgrade Independence American, the Company's Results of Operations and Competitive Position in the Industry May Suffer  Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Independence American is rated B+ (Very Good) by A.M. Best Company, Inc., whose ratings reflect its opinions of an insurance company's financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders, and are not evaluations directed to investors. The rating of Independence American is subject to periodic review by A.M. Best Company, Inc., and the Company is not assured of the continued retention of this rating.  If A.M. Best Company, Inc. reduces Independence American's ratings from its current levels, the Company's business would be adversely affected.  The Company's Loss Reserves are Based on an Estimate of Its Future Liability, and if Actual Claims Prove to be Greater Than Reserves, the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition May be Adversely Affected.  The Company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees as well as a portion of its general expenses, for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period.  Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, the Company cannot assure that current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.  If the Company reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, it would have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings, and these charges could be material. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability.  Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what the Company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost.  These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates o f future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors.  These variables are affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial trends and legislative changes.  Many of these items are not directly quantifiable in advance.   Additionally, there may be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported.  The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities, particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made.  Reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled.  Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed.  Inability to Assess Underwriting Risk Accurately Could Reduce Its Net Income  The Company's success is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained.  If the Company fails to assess accurately the risks it retains, it may fail to establish the appropriate premium rates and its reserves may be inadequate to cover its losses, requiring augmentation of the Company reserves, and a reduction in future profit commissions which in turn could reduce net income.  If the Company is Unsuccessful in Competing Against Larger or More Well-Established Competitors, Its Results of Operations and Financial Condition Will Be Adversely Affected  The Company's industry is highly competitive and has experienced severe price competition from time to time over the last several years.  The Company faces competition from domestic and international insurance and reinsurance companies, underwriting agencies, and from diversified financial services companies that are significantly larger than the Company.  Some of these competitors have greater financial, marketing and other resources, have been operating longer than the Company and have established long-term and continuing business relationships through the industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage.  In addition to competition in the operation of its business, the Company faces competition from a variety of sources in attracting and retaining qualified employees.  The Company cannot assure that it will maintain its current competitive position in the markets in which it operates, or that it will be able to expand its operations into new markets and compete effectively in the future.  If the Company fails to do so, its business could be materially adversely affected.   If the Company Fails to Comply with Extensive State and Federal Regulations, It Will Be Subject to Penalties, Which May Include Fines and Suspension and Which May Adversely Affect its Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  	The Company is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors.  This regulation, generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which it does business, relates to, among other things:    Approval of policy forms and premium rates;  Standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements, which are a measure developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and used by state insurance regulators to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized;  Licensing of insurers and their agents;  Restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;  Restrictions on the ability of Independence American's to pay dividends to the Company;  Restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates;  Restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy;  Requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;  Requiring certain methods of accounting;  Periodic examinations of the Company's operations and finances;  Prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and  Requiring reserves for unearned premium, losses and other purposes.   State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters.  Recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation is expected to lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years.  The Company's business depends on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and its ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for its operations.  Regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, or revoke licenses and approvals.  Regulatory authorities may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation or regulations.  In some instances, the Company follows practices based on its interpretations of regulations, or those that it believes to be generally followed by the industry, which may be different from the requirements or interpretations of regulatory authorities.  If the Company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals and does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend it from carrying on some or all of its activities or otherwise penalize it.  That type of action could have a material adverse effect on its business. Also, changes in the level of regulation of the in surance industry (whether federal, state or foreign), or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.  Certain Proposed Federal and State Legislation May, if Adopted, Adversely Affect the Company's Reinsurance of Medical Stop-Loss.  Individuals who obtain health coverage through self-insured plans cannot currently sue their employer in state court for punitive or compensatory damages, but can seek legal recourse in federal court where an employer can be ordered to cover a wrongfully-denied benefit.  In the continuing debate over health care reform, certain federal and state legislation has been proposed which could have the effect of making plan sponsors, administrators, or certain other parties liable for punitive damages in state court.  While the Company cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or what, if any, impact enactment of any of these would have on its reinsurance of medical stop-loss, the number of employers offering health benefits or choosing self-insured plans could be reduced, plans could increase the portion paid by employees (thereby reducing participation), pricing and coverage options could be affected, and the Company could be faced with greater liability exposure.  Decreases in the Fair Market Value of Fixed Income Securities May Greatly Reduce the Value of the Company's Investment Portfolio, and as a Result, the Company's Financial Condition May Suffer  At December 31, 2003, $31.0 million of the Company's $38.3 million investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities.  The fair market value of these fixed income securities and the investment income from these fixed income securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions.  With respect to the Company's investments in fixed income securities, the fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by the Company from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates.  In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.  An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates.  Historically, the impact of market fluctuations has affected the Company's financial statements.  Because all of the Company's fixed income securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the fair market value of the Company's securities are reflected in the Company's other comprehensive income.  Similar treatment is not available for liabilities.  Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could aversely affect the Company's stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income (loss) and/or cash flows.     Regulatory Restrictions Limit the Company's Ability to Obtain Dividends from Independence American  One of the Company's principal assets through its ownership of IAHC, is the shares of capital stock of Independence American. The Company may rely on dividends from Independence American to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses.  The payment of dividends by Independence American is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of Independence American, as well as the regulatory restrictions.  As a result, should the Company's other sources of funds prove to be inadequate.  The Company may not be able to receive dividends from Independence American at times and in amounts necessary to meet its obligations.  Prospective Anti-Takeover Provisions Could Negatively Impact the Company's Stockholders  The Company is a Delaware corporation.  The Delaware General Corporation Law contains certain provisions that may discourage or delay a change in control of the Company, make a change in control the Company more difficult or prevent the removal of incumbent directors.  In addition, the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that have the same or a similar effect.  These provisions may have a negative impact on the price of the Company's common stock and may discourage third-party bidders from making a bid for the Company or may reduce any premiums paid to stockholders for their common stock.      Item 7A.
