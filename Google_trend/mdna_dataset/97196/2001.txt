Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements of the Company and the related Notes thereto  appearing  elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  This  discussion contains  forward-looking  statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  The Company's actual results could differ  materially from those  anticipated in the forward-looking  statements as a result of certain  factors  including,  but not limited to, those discussed in "Risk Factors",  "Business" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The Company disclaims any obligation to update information  contained in any forward-looking statement.   Overview   The Company currently conducts its continuing operations through its subsidiary, Intelligent   Communications,   Inc.  ("Intellicom"),   which  provides  two-way broadband satellite connectivity utilizing very small aperture terminal ("VSAT") technology to a wide variety of business customers.   Revenue for Intellicom consists of (i) monthly service fees paid by users of the satellite service on a per VSAT basis, (ii) VSAT-related  equipment sales, (iii) revenue from  sub-leasing of excess  satellite  transponder  space and (iv) data center  processing  fees.  The last  category  represents  legacy  business that Intellicom exited September 30, 1999, to focus on its core business of providing high-speed Internet access using two-way satellite technology.  Cost of sales for Intellicom  consists  primarily of connectivity cost and costs of VSAT equipment sold.  Intellicom's  connectivity  cost consists  primarily of satellite transponder fees.  Currently,  Intellicom has transponder space on two satellites,  GE-3  and  SatMex  5,  both of  which  provide  coverage  over  the continental United States and beyond.   The Company reports operating  expenses in several  categories:  (i) selling and marketing  includes,  in  addition  to the costs of selling  and  marketing  the Company's services to end users,  customer care, content  production,  and cable partnering costs; (ii) engineering,  which includes the costs of maintaining and manning  the  network  operations  center,  field  engineering  and  information technology;  and (iii)  general  and  administrative  costs.  Also  included  in operating  expenses is depreciation,  amortization  and compensation  related to stock options. Amortization expense primarily consists of the periodic write off of  developed  technology  acquired.   Compensation  related  to  stock  options primarily  relates to the  amortization of deferred stock  compensation  expense from stock options granted between October 1998 and March 1999.   The results of operations  for the years ended  September 30, 1999 and 1998 have been  restated  for the  effects  of  discontinued  operations  of  Micrographic Technology  Corporation  ("MTC"),  Kansas  Communications,   Inc.  ("KCI"),  ISP Channel,  Inc.  ("ISP  Channel")  and  Aerzone  Corporation  ("Aerzone"),  which includes  the  results  of  Laptop  Lane  Limited   ("Laptop  Lane")  since  its acquisition on April 21, 2000.

Acquisition of Intellicom. On February 9, 1999, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and into Intelligent Communications,  Inc. ("Intellicom" and the "Intellicom  Acquisition").  The purchase price of $14,869,000 was comprised of:  (i) a  cash  component  of  $500,000  (the  "Cash  Consideration");  (ii) a promissory note in the amount of $1,000,000  bearing  interest at 7.5% per annum and due one year after closing (the "First Promissory Note"); (iii) a promissory note in the amount of $2,000,000  bearing interest at 8.5% per annum and due two years after  closing  (the "Second  Promissory  Note",  together  with the First Promissory Note, the "Debt Consideration");  (iv) the issuance of 500,000 shares of the  Company's  common stock  (adjustable  upwards  after one year in certain circumstances),  valued at $14.938 per share,  for a total  value of  $7,469,000 (the "Closing  Shares");  (v)  additional  shares of the Company's  common stock issuable upon the first, second and third  anniversaries of the closing,  valued at a total of $3,500,000 (the  "Anniversary  Shares",  together with the Closing Shares, the "Equity  Consideration");  and (vi) certain direct acquisition costs totaling  $400,000.  The Debt Consideration may be partially or wholly converted into the Company's  common stock,  under certain  circumstances.  The conversion price of the Debt  Consideration  is based upon the average closing price of the Company's  common stock for the 15 days  immediately  preceding  the  conversion date. Both the Debt Consideration and the Equity  Consideration were issued in a nonpublic  offering  pursuant to  transactions  exempt under Section 4(2) of the Securities  Act. In April 1999, the Company paid the First  Promissory  Note and related interest in full with a combination of cash and equity. The Company paid $832,000 in cash and the  remainder,  after  expenses,  with 6,118  common stock shares valued at $190,000.  The Intellicom  Acquisition  agreement  requires the Company to issue $1,500,000 of common stock shares on the first anniversary date of the  Intellicom  Acquisition. Accordingly,  on February 8, 2000,  the Company issued  43,314  common stock  shares  valued at  $1,499,000  and paid $1,000 for fractional shares to the former  shareholders of Intellicom.  Additionally,  the Intellicom  Acquisition agreement includes a demonstration bonus ("Demonstration Bonus") of $1,000,000 payable in cash or shares of the Company's common stock at the Company's option by the first anniversary date of the Intellicom Acquisition if certain  conditions are met. On February 8, 2000, the opportunity to earn the Demonstration Bonus had expired, and accordingly the Demonstration Bonus was not paid nor included in the purchase price of Intellicom.    Formation of Aerzone, Acquisition of Laptop Lane, and Discontinued Operations of Aerzone. On January 24, 2000 the Company founded Aerzone (formerly SoftNet Zone, Inc.), a Delaware  corporation,  to provide high-speed Internet access to global business travelers. As part of the Aerzone business, the Company acquired Laptop Lane, a Washington corporation, on April 21, 2000. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method and the results of Laptop Lane are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.  Laptop Lane is a leading  provider of business  center  services in airports.  The Company paid approximately  $21,559,000  consisting of (i) 972,266 common stock shares of the Company  valued at  $15,107,000,  net of  adjustment  for  expenses  paid by the Company on behalf of Laptop Lane,  exchanged  for all  outstanding  common stock shares  of  Laptop  Lane,  (ii)  direct   acquisition   costs  of  approximately $2,300,000, which includes a bonus payment to Laptop Lane employees for $431,000 in lieu of Laptop Lane stock  options,  and (iii) 250,000 common stock shares of the Company valued at $3,652,000 to be issued to former Laptop Lane stockholders in payment  for  achieving  certain  criteria.  As part of the  acquisition,  an additional  333,333  common stock shares of the Company will be  distributed  to former Laptop Lane  stockholders if certain  performance goals or other criteria are met. As of September  30, 2000,  Laptop Lane has achieved  three of the four performance  goals,  as a result  249,981 common stock shares of the Company and cash  amounting  to  $3,652,000  was  distributed  to  the  former  Laptop  Lane stockholders.  The fourth  performance goal requirement was met in October 2000, as a result, upon the resolution of certain claims against Laptop Lane, all or a portion of the remaining 83,333 common stock shares of the Company  amounting to $500,000  was  accrued  for  and  will  be  issued  to the  former  Laptop  Lane stockholders.  Additionally,  in connection  with the  acquisition,  the Company provided  $6,000,000  in  working  capital  to  Laptop  Lane,  under  a  secured promissory note.  Subsequently,  on December  19, 2000,  the Company  decided to  discontinue  the Aerzone  business  in light  of  significant  long-term  capital  needs  and the difficulty of securing the necessary  financing  because of the current state of the financial markets.  The plan includes a reduction in personnel.  The Company anticipates that it will sell Laptop Lane. The operating  results of Aerzone has been  segregated  from  continuing  operations  and is  reported  as  loss  from discontinued operations, net of tax on the consolidated statement of operations. The assets and liabilities of such operations are reflected in the  discontinued operations reserve on the consolidated  balance sheets as of September 30, 2000. The estimated loss on disposal of Aerzone is $42,200,000.   Discontinued Operations of ISP Channel. On December 7, 2000, the Company's Board of  Directors  approved a plan to  discontinue  providing  cable-based  Internet services through its ISP Channel  subsidiary by December 31, 2000 because of (1) consolidation in the cable television industry made it difficult for ISP Channel to achieve the economies of scale necessary to provide such services profitably, and (2) the Company was no longer able to bear the costs of maintaining  the ISP Channel.  The  operating  results  of  ISP  Channel  has  been  segregated  from continuing operations and is reported as loss from discontinued operations,  net of tax on the  consolidated  statements of  operations.  The  estimated  loss on disposal of ISP Channel is $97,200,000.  Sale of KCI.  On  February  12,  1999,  substantially  all of the  assets of the telecommunications   segment,  KCI,  were  sold  to  Convergent   Communications Services, Inc. ("Convergent  Communications") for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  $6,300,000  subject to adjustment in certain  events.  Convergent Communications  paid  $100,000 in cash in November  1998 upon  execution  of the letter of intent to purchase and paid the remainder of the purchase price on the closing date as follows:  (i)  $1,400,000  in cash;  (ii)  approximately  30,000 shares of Convergent  Communications' parent company common stock with an agreed value of approximately  $300,000 (the "Convergent  Shares");  (iii) a promissory note in the amount of $2,000,000  (the "First  Convergent  Note") bearing simple interest  at the rate of 11% per  annum  and  payable  on July 1,  2000;  (iv) a promissory  note in the amount of  $1,000,000  (the  "Second  Convergent  Note") bearing  simple  interest  at the rate of 8% per  annum  and  payable  12 months following  the  closing  date  ; and  (v) a  promissory  note  in an  amount  of $1,500,000 (the "Third  Convergent Note") bearing simple interest at the rate of 8% per annum and payable 12 months  following the closing date, which is subject to  mandatory  prepayment  in certain  events.  Furthermore,  a  purchase  price adjustment subsequent to closing provided the Company with additional Convergent Shares with an agreed value of $198,000  for a total  investment  in  Convergent Communications common stock of $498,000.  The sale of KCI's assets resulted in a gain of $2,141,000.  For the year ended  September 30, 1999, the First and Third Convergent  Notes were paid in full. On November 5, 1999, the Second  Convergent Note was paid in full.  The initial cash proceeds  received from the sale of KCI were used to pay down the Company's revolving credit facility with West Suburban Bank.   Sale of MTC. On September  30, 1999,  the Company  sold the  Company's  document management business, MTC, to Global Information Distribution GmbH ("GID") for an aggregate  purchase  price of  approximately  $4,894,000 in cash,  which,  after selling  costs,  resulted  in  a  loss  of  $321,000.  GID  paid  $100,000  as a non-refundable  deposit  upon  acceptance  of the GID term  sheet.  GID paid the Company the remaining $4,794,000 at the closing. The cash proceeds from the sale of MTC were used in part to repay the Company's  revolving  credit facility with West Suburban Bank. As of September 30, 1999 there was nothing outstanding under this facility. The balance of the proceeds was used to pay for transaction costs associated with the sale of MTC and to increase the Company's cash position.    Item 7a.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk  The  Company's  exposure to market risk for  changes in interest  rates  relates primarily  to the  increase or  decrease  in the amount of  interest  income the Company can earn on its investment  portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest  expense the Company must pay with respect to its various outstanding  debt  instruments.  The risk associated with  fluctuating  interest expense is limited,  however,  to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit facilities,  which are tied to market rates. The Company does not use derivative  financial  instruments  in its  investment  portfolio.  The  Company ensures the safety and preservation of its invested  principal funds by limiting default risks,  market risk and reinvestment risk. The Company mitigates default risk by investing in safe and high-credit quality securities.   The Company had short-term  investments of  $127,403,000  at September 30, 2000. These short-term  investments consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of between three and eighteen  months.  These investments  are subject to interest  rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.  The Company believes a hypothetical increase in market interest rates by 10 percent from levels at September 30, 2000,  would cause the fair value of these  short-term  investments  to fall by an  immaterial  amount. Since the Company is not required to sell these investments before maturity,  we have the ability to avoid realizing losses on these  investments due to a sudden change in market  interest  rates.  On the other hand,  declines in the interest rates over time will reduce our interest income.   The  Company had  outstanding  convertible  debt  instruments  of  approximately $2,104,000 at September 30, 2000.  These  instruments  have fixed interest rates ranging from 5.0% to 6.0%.  Because the interest rates of these  instruments are fixed,  a  hypothetical  10 percent  increase in interest  rates will not have a material effect on the Company. Interest rate increases,  however, will increase interest expense  associated with future  borrowing by the Company,  if any. The Company does not hedge against interest rate fluctuations.  Equity Price Risk   The Company  through its business  dealings has obtained common stock of various publicly traded technology companies, which are classified as available-for-sale securities.  As a result,  the Company  values these  investments on its balance sheet at September  30, 2000 at market  value.  Unrealized  gains and losses are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other  comprehensive loss component of  stockholders'  equity.  The Company has not attempted to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities, and such investments were not significant  to the  Company in the prior year.  A 50% adverse  change in equity prices, based on a sensitivity analysis of technology stocks, would result in an approximate   $4,900,000   decrease   in  the  fair   value  of  the   Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio as of September 30, 2000.   Currency Exchange Risk  The  Company  has  historically  had very low  exposure  to  changes  in foreign currency  exchange  rates,  and as  such,  has  not  used  derivative  financial instruments to manage foreign currency  fluctuation risk. As the Company expands globally,   the  risk  of  foreign   currency   exchange  rate  fluctuation  may dramatically  increase.  Therefore,  in the future,  the  Company  may  consider utilizing derivative instruments to mitigate such risks.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin  No. 101 ("SAB 101"),  Revenue  Recognition  in  Financial  Statements. Implementation  is scheduled for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999, which would be effective for the Company  beginning in fiscal year 2001. SAB 101 addresses  various topics in revenue  recognition  including the  recognition of revenue for contracts  involving  multiple  deliverables.  Based on management's current  understanding  and  interpretation,  SAB 101 is not  expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.    In June 2000, the FASB issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 138 ("FASB 138"),  Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments  and Certain Hedging  Activities,  an amendment to FASB Statement No. 133 ("FASB 133").  FASB 138 addresses a limited number of issues causing implementation difficulties for companies  that are  required  to apply FASB 133.  FASB 133,  as amended by FASB Statement No. 137, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities - - Deferral of the effective date of FASB Statement No. 133, is effective for all fiscal  quarters of all fiscal years  beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company believes  that  FASB 133 and FASB 138  will not have a  material  impact  on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.       Item 8.
