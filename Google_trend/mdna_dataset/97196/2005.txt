Since November 2002, AMIC has been affiliated with Independence Holding Company ("IHC"), which currently owns 40% of AMIC's stock, and IHC's senior management has provided direction to the Company through a service agreement between the Company and IHC.  IHC has also entered into long-term reinsurance treaties to cede Medical Stop-Loss and other business to Independence American.    While management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning, the overriding consideration is underwriting profitability.  Management's assessment of trends in healthcare and in the Medical Stop-Loss market play a significant role in determining whether to expand Independence American's reinsurance participation percentage or the number of programs it reinsures.  Since Independence American reinsures a portion of all of the business produced by the MGUs, and since the MGUs are also eligible to earn profit sharing commissions based on the profitability of the business they write, the MGUs also emphasize underwriting profitability.  In addition, management focuses on controlling operating costs.  By sharing employees with IHC and sharing resources among the MGUs and Independence American, AMIC strives to maximize its earnings.   The following are highlights in 2004 for the Company:   Independence American Insurance Company      Premiums increased to $60.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2004 from $37.8 million in the year ended 2003.      2004 was negatively impacted by higher than expected claims from certain of Independence American's Medical Stop-Loss programs.  										  Added 10 additional licenses, bringing total to 33 states and District of Columbia.      Average percentage of Medical Stop-Loss business ceded from IHC to Independence American increased to 19.3% during 2004 from 13.1% during 2003.      Began reinsuring 20% of IHC's DBL business in the third quarter of 2004.      92% of invested assets in bonds and short-term investments, 98% of the bonds have the highest NAIC rating designation (NAIC ratings of 1 and 2 designation).      Employer Medical Stop-Loss policy approved in 24 states and Provider Excess Loss policy approved in 13 states.          MGU Division (IndependenceCare, Marlton, RAS)     Acquired IndependenceCare Underwriting Services - MidAtlantic LLC, a Medical Stop-Loss MGU.      Acquired a 23% interest in Majestic Underwriters LLC, a Medical Stop-Loss MGU.         In 2004, the MGUs wrote an aggregate of $136.1 million of annualized gross premium and generated pre-tax income of $ 7.1 million, as compared to $135.0 million and $6.8 million in 2003, respectively.       In 2004, the MGUs generated revenues of $17.8 million, as compared to $15.5 million in 2003, an increase of 14.6%.       History   	Until April 2002, the Company (then known as SoftNet Systems, Inc.) was an Internet service provider.  Due to difficult and deteriorating conditions in that market, the Company discontinued this business.  In December 2000, the Company's board of directors approved a plan to discontinue the operations of its subsidiary, ISP Channel, Inc., which had provided cable-based Internet access and related services, and the operations of another subsidiary, Aerzone Corporation, which provided Internet and related services at airports.  In April 2002, the Company ceased operations of its remaining operating subsidiary, Intelligent Communications, Inc., following the disposition of its key assets.  In connection with the Company's exit from the Internet provider business, it undertook a process of consideration of strategic alternatives for the Company.              On July 30, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire First Standard Holdings Corp. ("FSHC") from SSH Corp. and Independence Holding Company ("IHC") for $31,920,000 in cash.  As described below, FSHC was the holding company for an insurance company and two managing general underwriters ("MGUs"). Subsequently at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on November 14, 2002, the Company's stockholders approved the stock purchase agreement between the Company, SSH Corp. and IHC (the "Purchase Agreement"), and approved the Company's name change to American Independence Corp. Also on November 14, 2002, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and FSHC changed its name to Independence American Holdings Corp. ("IAHC").  Following this acquisition, the Company closed its offices in San Francisco, terminated all but two of its employees, and entered into a services agreement with IHC pursuant to which the Company's operations are directed by I HC's management and employees.    	In a separate transaction on July 30, 2002, IHC acquired Pacific Century Cyberworks Limited's ("PCCW") entire interest in the Company consisting of 1,666,666 shares of common stock at $9.00 per share for a total value of $15,000,000. As a result of this transaction, PCCW's two appointees resigned from the Company's Board of Directors, and Edward Netter, Chairman of IHC, and Roy T.K. Thung, President and Chief Executive Officer of IHC, were appointed to the Company's Board of Directors.  On April 22, 2003, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IHC completed its tender for one million shares of the common stock of the Company at $9.00 per share for a total value of $9 million.  On December 22, 2003, IHC purchased an aggregate of 613,401 shares in the market and private transactions.  During 2004, IHC purchased an additional 1% interest in the Company.  At December 31, 2004, IHC owned a 40% interest in AMIC.     	On February 10, 2003, but effective as of January 1, 2003, the Company acquired 80% of the business of an employer Medical Stop-Loss MGU and an affiliated entity (the "Acquired MGUs").  The acquisition was accomplished by the formation of Voorhees Risk Management LLC d.b.a. Marlton Risk Group ("Marlton") into which the Acquired MGUs contributed all of their assets, and the Company contributed $16,000,000 cash for an 80% ownership interest.  The Company's cash contribution was then distributed to the Acquired MGUs together with the remaining 20% interest in Marlton, and Marlton assumed all of the liabilities of the Acquired MGUs.  Under certain circumstances set forth in the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Marlton, the Company has the right and/or obligation to purchase some or all of the minority interests in Marlton.   On April 16, 2004, the Company expanded its business through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of an employer Medical Stop-Loss managing general underwriter, which had a block of approximately $13 million of annualized premium, for a purchase price of $600,000.  The assets were acquired by IndependenceCare Underwriting Services-MidAtlantic LLC ("ICH-MidAtlantic"), which is a subsidiary of IndependenceCare Holdings.  ICH-MidAtlantic, which is based in Baltimore, Maryland, retained the key marketing personnel of the former MGU.  This acquisition resulted in goodwill in the amount of $486,000 and intangible assets in the amount of $114,000.   Effective July 1, 2004, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired a 23% interest in Majestic Underwriters LLC ("Majestic"), a Medical Stop-Loss managing general underwriter which had a block of approximately $41 million of annualized premium, for a purchase price of $1,610,000.  Concurrently, wholly-owned subsidiaries of IHC acquired a 52% interest in Majestic.  The senior management of Majestic owns the remaining 25% interest.  The Company accounts for this investment using the equity method of accounting.  This acquisition resulted in a $522,000 reduction of valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets, with the effect being an increase to deferred tax asset and a corresponding decrease in other investments.  Under certain circumstances set forth in the Limited Liability Agreement of Majestic, the Company and/or IHC have the right and/or obligation to purchase some or all of the minority interest in Majestic.    	As of December 31, 2004, the Company had substantially completed the wind down of all of its Internet services related subsidiaries, ISP Channel, Intellicom, and Aerzone, as well as its other subsidiaries, MTC and KCI.     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   	The preparation of consolidated financials statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. Management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that, due to the judgments, estimates and as sumptions inherent in those policies, are critical to an understanding of the Company's consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and analysis.   Insurance Reserves   	The Company maintains insurance reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees as well as a portion of the Company's general expenses, for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period.  Liabilities for insurance reserves on short-term medical and disability coverages were computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data.  These methods are widely used in the health insurance industry to estimate the liabilities for insurance reserves. Inherent in these calculations are management and actuarial judgments and estimates which could significantly impact the ending reserve liabilities and, consequently, operating results.  Actual results may differ, and these estimates are subject to interpretation and change.  Management believes that the Company's method of estimating the liabilities for insurance reserves provides  reasonably accurate levels of reserves at December 31, 2004 and 2003; however, changes in the Company's reserves estimates, if any, will be recorded through a charge or credit to its earnings.  Income Taxes    In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers   whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible.  Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.  Management believes that although sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, the valuation allowance has been adjusted to account for the expected utilization of net operating losses against future taxable income. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes available to reduce future income subject to income taxes.  The net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2018 and 2023.       U.S. federal and California tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an "ownership change" for tax purposes, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. For tax purposes, an ownership change occurred during 1999 and, as a result, utilization of the net operating losses arising prior to 1999 will be subject to an annual limitation in future years (see Note 16).  Premium and MGU Fee Income Revenue Recognition  	Direct and assumed premiums from short-duration contracts will be recognized as revenue over the period of the contracts in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided.  The Company records MGU fee income as policy premium payments are earned.  MGUs are compensated in two ways.  They earn fee income based on the volume of business produced, and collect profit-sharing commissions if such business exceeds certain profitability benchmarks. Profit-sharing commissions are accounted for beginning in the period in which the Company believes they are reasonably estimable. Profit-sharing commissions are a function of an MGU attaining certain profitability thresholds and could greatly vary from quarter to quarter.   Investments    The Company accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS 115"),  Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.  The Company has classified all of its investments as available-for-sale or trading securities. These investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealized gains and losses reported in either accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets for available-for-sale securities or as unrealized gains or losses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for trading securities. Net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and are reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the accompanying C onsolidated Statements of Operations as net realized losses. The factors considered by management in determining when a decline is other than temporary include but are not limited to:  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies; whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments; whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or, alternatively, a reflection of general market or industry conditions; and the Company's intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value.  For securities within the scope of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 99-20, such as purchased interest-only securities, an impairment loss is recognized when there has been a decrease in expected cash flows combined with a decline in the security's fair value below  cost.  Goodwill and Other Intangibles              The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , effective July 1, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, which consist of licenses, are not amortized but are tested for impairment, on a reporting unit basis, at the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators arise. The Company defines its reporting units on a segment basis.            The Company's intangible assets consisting of broker/third party relationships are amortized over five years.       Discontinued Operations  	The Company accounts for discontinued operations in accordance to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 ("APB 30"),  Reporting the Results of Operations - - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.  Under APB 30, the Company accrued estimates of expected liabilities related to discontinued operations through its eventual discharge. The estimated remaining liabilities related to discontinued operations include contract terminations, litigation and loss from operations subsequent to September 30, 2002. The Company reviews the estimated closure costs liability on a quarterly basis to determine changes in the costs of the discontinued operations activities.         Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2004, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2003    Premiums Earned .   Premiums earned increased $22,386,000 to $60,203,000 for the fiscal 2004, compared to $37,817,000 for fiscal 2003, an increase of 59.2%.  This is primarily due to a combination of a higher percentage of Medical Stop-Loss business assumed from, as well as increased volume of business written by, Independence Holding Company in 2004.  The average percentage of Medical Stop-Loss business ceded from IHC to Independence American for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was 19.3% and 13.1%, respectively.  Beginning in the 2004 third quarter, IHC also ceded 20% of its DBL premiums to Independence American.  Net Investment Income.  Net investment income increased $324,000 to $2,291,000 for fiscal 2004, compared to $1,967,000 for fiscal 2003, due to a higher invested asset base in 2004, offset by a slightly lower return on investments.  The return on investments of the Company was 5.15% in fiscal 2004 and 5.58% in fiscal 2003.     Net Realized Gains.  Net realized gains decreased $108,000 to $222,000 for fiscal 2004, compared to $330,000 for fiscal 2003.  The Company's decision as to whether to sell securities is based on cash flow needs, investment opportunities, and economic market conditions, thus creating fluctuations in realized gains or losses from period to period.  Offsetting net realized gains for fiscal 2004 is a realized loss of $134,000 from unrealized losses on securities that the Company deemed to be other than temporary in nature.  For fiscal 2003, there was no realized loss from unrealized losses on securities that the Company deemed to be other than temporary in nature.   MGU Fee Income.  The Company earned $17,597,000 of fee income from its MGUs for fiscal 2004 as compared to $15,427,000 for fiscal 2003, an increase of $2,170,000.  Included in fee income is $2,749,000 and $2,619,000 of MGU profit commissions in 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Profit commissions for a given year are typically based on the performance of business written during portions of the two preceding years.  Therefore, profit commissions for 2005 will be based on business written during portions of 2003 and 2004.  Since certain of the MGUs experienced higher loss ratios in those years, profit commissions for the 2005 fiscal year and future years may be adversely affected.      Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $9,448,000 to   $29,172,000 for fiscal 2004, compared to $19,724,000 for fiscal 2003. The increase is primarily due to commission expense recorded by Independence American and operating expenses from the MGUs.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the MGUs were $8,629,000 and commission expense for Independence American was $18,152,000 for fiscal 2004.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses for MGUs, were $10,732,000 and commission expense for Independence American was $8,902,000 for fiscal 2003.   Insurance Benefits, Claims and Reserves.  Insurance benefits, claims and reserves amounted to $39,173,000 for fiscal 2004 as compared to $23,312,000 for fiscal 2003, an increase of $15,861,000, or 68%.  The increase is mainly due to additional claims relating to increased earned premium volume from   Independence American in 2004.  Additionally, 2004 was negatively impacted by higher than expected claims from certain of Independence American's 2003 Medical Stop-Loss programs.  Insurance benefits, claims and reserves for 2004 includes a charge of $1,730,000 to reflect loss development from prior treaty years and a corresponding increase in reserves for the current treaty year.  While management sets reserves based on its best estimate of ultimate claim settlement cost, the Company adjusts reserves as claims mature, approach settlement or are otherwise resolved.      Amortization and Depreciation.  Amortization and depreciation expense decreased $345,000 to $1,666,000 for fiscal 2004, compared to $2,011,000 for fiscal 2003.  The expense primarily relates to the amortization of the intangible assets for the value of broker/TPA relationships of the MGUs. These intangible assets were acquired as part of acquisitions made by the Company.  Amortization expense for these intangible assets will decline over the useful lives of the assets.   Non-Cash Compensation Expense Related to Stock Options.  The Company recognized non-cash compensation expense related to stock options of $456,000 for fiscal 2004.  This expense relates to the fair value of options issued and accounted for under SFAS No. 123.  The expense for fiscal 2003 was $141,000.   Restructuring Expense.  The Company recognized an expense of $152,000 for fiscal 2003 and no related expense for fiscal 2004.  At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, a restructuring accrual of $300,000 and $866,000, respectively, remained outstanding.     Minority Interest.   The Company recorded $678,000 for fiscal 2004 and $645,000 for fiscal 2003 of expense related to the 20% minority interest in Marlton.   Income Taxes.   The income tax expense was $3,569,000 for fiscal 2004 as compared to a tax benefit of $2,993,000 for fiscal 2003, an increase of $6,562,000.    In 2003, the Company further reduced the valuation allowance relating to the deferred tax asset, which caused a corresponding increase in such deferred tax asset.  The valuation allowance relates to the possibility that AMIC might not be able to fully utilize its prior tax year federal net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs").  AMIC reviews the valuation allowance quarterly to determine the reasonableness of the amount, and previously reduced it in connection with the Company's acquisitions in 2002, 2003 and 2004.  Based upon AMIC's profitability in 2003 and projected continuing profitable results, it was management's view that it was appropriate to further reduce the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2003 which resulted in an increase in net income and income from continuing operations.  There was no such  adjustment in 2004.   Gain on Discontinued Operations.  Gain on discontinued operations was $240,000 for fiscal 2004, compared to a gain of $110,000 for fiscal 2003, an increase of $130,000.  The gain in 2004 is primarily attributable to lower than expected expenses related to Intellicom, MTC, ISP Channel and KCI.  Net Income.  The Company had net income of $5,904,000, or $.69 diluted per share, for fiscal 2004, compared to net income of $12,671,000, or $1.50 per share diluted, for fiscal year 2003.        Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2003, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2002    Premiums Earned .   The Company earned $37,817,000 of premiums on insurance business of Independence American for fiscal 2003.  Net Investment Income.  Net investment income increased $237,000 to $1,967,000 for fiscal 2003, compared to $1,730,000 for fiscal 2002, mainly due to a higher yield from investments in fixed maturities in 2003.  Investment income in 2002, although based on greater assets, was at a lower yield due to the shorter duration of the investments.   Net Realized Gains.  The Company realized net gains of $330,000 from sales of its investments for fiscal 2003.  Decisions to sell securities are based on cash flow needs, investment opportunities, and economic and market conditions, thus creating fluctuations in gains or losses from period to period.   MGU Fee Income.  The Company earned $15,427,000 of fee income from its MGUs for fiscal 2003.  Of this amount $2,619,000 relates to MGU profit commissions.   Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $12,406,000 to   $19,724,000 for fiscal 2003, compared to $7,318,000 for fiscal 2002. The increase is primarily due to commission expense recorded by Independence American and operating expenses from the MGUs.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the 3 MGUs were $7,882,000 and commission expense for Independence American was $10,660,000 for fiscal 2003.   Insurance Benefits, Claims and Reserves.   Insurance benefits, claims and reserves amounted to $23,312,000 related to the premiums earned by Independence American for fiscal 2003.  Amortization and Depreciation.  Amortization and depreciation expense increased $1,822,000 to $2,011,000 for fiscal 2003, compared to $189,000 for fiscal 2002.  The expense for fiscal 2003 mainly relates to the amortization of the intangible assets for the value of broker/TPA relationships of the MGUs. These intangible assets were acquired as part of the acquisitions of IAHC and Marlton.   Non-Cash Compensation Expense Related to Stock Options.  The Company recognized non-cash compensation expense related to stock options of $141,000 for fiscal 2003.  This expense relates to the fair value of options issued in 2003 accounted for under SFAS No. 123.  The expense for fiscal 2002 of $1,466,000 relates to options accounted for under APB 25.   Minority Interest.  The Company's share of minority interest expense for fiscal 2003 was $645,000 for its share of its investment in Voorhees.    Income Taxes.   The Company had a benefit of income taxes of $2,993,000 for fiscal 2003.  This includes a benefit of $4,466,000 due to a reduction of the valuation allowance.  In 2003, the Company further reduced the valuation allowance relating to the deferred tax asset, which caused a corresponding increase in such deferred tax asset.  The valuation allowance relates to the possibility that AMIC might not be able to fully utilize its prior tax year federal net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs").  AMIC reviews the valuation allowance quarterly to determine the reasonableness of the amount, and previously reduced it in connection with the Company's acquisitions in 2002 and 2003.  Based upon AMIC's profitability in 2003 and projected continuing profitable results, it was management's view that it was appropriate to further reduce the valuation allowance quarterly in the fourth quarter of 2003, which resulted in an increase in net income and income from continuing operations .  There was no such adjustment in 2002.   The Company's tax year end is September 30, and, for the first nine months of 2003, AMIC had a recovery for federal income taxes arising from losses in the fourth quarter of 2002.  These losses were fully applied, and the Company began to utilize its NOLs, in the fourth quarter of 2003.  As long as AMIC utilizes these NOLs, it will not pay any income taxes, except for federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes.  In the first nine months of 2003, AMIC did not have any provision for federal income taxes on its income statement due to losses arising in the fourth quarter of 2002.  Starting in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company had a provision for federal income taxes of $920,000 on its income statement, and the utilization of its NOLs reduced the deferred tax asset on its balance sheet.   The Company also had a provision for state income taxes of $504,000 for fiscal 2003.   Provision for Impaired Assets. The Company recognized a charge of $352,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, as a result of writing off its accounting software. In light of its reduced operations, the Company changed to an off-the-shelf accounting software.   Restructuring Expense. The Company recognized a restructuring charge for the year ended September 30, 2001, related to the downsizing of its corporate headquarters' staff. The charge in the amount of $3,900,000 was recognized as restructuring expense and primarily consisted of termination payments for affected employees. The Company increased the restructuring reserve by $152,000 for fiscal 2003 and $502,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, respectively, as a result of additional estimated lease termination costs associated with Company's headquarters.  At December 31, 2003 and September 30, 2002, a restructuring accrual of $866,000 and $1,446,000 respectively, remained outstanding.   Loss on Equity Investments. The Company recognized a loss on disposition of equity investments of $733,000 or fiscal 2002, consisting of $253,000 related to 1,000,000 SkyNet Global Limited common stock shares and $480,000 related to the 400,000 SkyNet Global Limited preference stock shares.    Gain (Loss) Attributed to Discontinued Operations. The Company recognized a $110,000 gain on discontinued operations for fiscal 2003, compared to a $5,926,000 loss attributed to discontinued operations for fiscal 2002.  For the year ended September 30, 2002, the loss attributed to discontinued operations consisted of a $3,120,000 loss on disposition of Interlace, a $1,829,000 loss from operations of Intellicom, a $1,127,000 loss on disposition of Micrographic Technology Corporation ("MTC"), as a result of a preliminary arbitration decision related to a dispute with Applications Informatiques Multimedia and a dispute related to the sale of MTC to Global Information Distribution GmbH, a $900,000 gain on disposition of ISP Channel, resulting from the lower than anticipated costs of closing ISP Channel, and a $750,000 loss on disposition of Aerzone, resulting from a court decision related to a breach of contract and other legal matters.  The gain of $110,000 in 2003 is primarily  attributable to lower than expected interest and expenses with regard to an arbitration award, substantially offset by additional reserves on Intellicom related to the lease obligations of the Livermore facility due to difficulty in subletting the facility as compared to original expectations.     Net Income/Loss. The Company had net income of $12,671,000 or $1.50 per share, diluted, for fiscal 2003, compared to a net loss of $14,756,000 or a net loss per share of $1.76, diluted, for the year ended September 30, 2002.    TRANSITION PERIOD ANALYSIS   Result of Operations for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2002, Compared to the Quarter Ended December 31, 2001   Due to the acquisition of the insurance operations of IAHC, certain line items do not appear in the quarter ended December 31, 2001 Consolidated Statement of Operations.   Premiums Earned .   The Company earned $1,636,000 of premiums on insurance business of Independence American for the six weeks ended December 31, 2002.   Net Investment Income.  Interest income decreased $324,000 to $292,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, compared to $616,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2001, as a result of lower interest rates, and a decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, available-for-sale due to the funding of losses from the Internet operations and the purchase of IAHC.   MGU Fee Income.  The Company earned $713,000 of fee income from its MGUs for the six weeks ended December 31, 2002 of this amount, $6,000 was from MGU profit sharing revenues.     Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3,451,000 to   $4,865,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, compared to $1,414,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2001. The increase is primarily due to estimated final expenses resulting from staff reductions associated with the December 28, 2000 corporate restructuring plan, the closing of the corporate headquarters in San Francisco and expenses related to corporate legal settlements and arbitration awards.   Insurance Benefits, Claims and Reserves.  Insurance benefits, claims and reserves amounted to $989,000 related to the premium earned by Independence American for the six weeks ended December 31, 2002.   Loss on Equity Investments.  The Company recognized a loss on equity investment of $1,000,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2002 as a result of the write-off of a preferred stock investment.  The Company did not incur a net loss on its equity investments in investee companies for the quarter ended December 31, 2001.   Amortization and Depreciation.  Amortization and depreciation expense increased $175,000 to $240,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, compared to $65,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2001.  The expense for December 31, 2002 relates to the amortization of the intangible asset for the value of third party administrators of the MGUs.  This asset was part of the purchase accounting adjustments for the acquisition of IAHC.   Non-Cash Compensation Expense (Benefit) Related to Stock Options.  The Company recognized a non-cash compensation expense related to stock options of $632,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2002. This expense is broken up into two components: an expense of $570,000 relating to the fair value of options issued for the three months ended December 31, 2002 accounted for under SFAS No. 123. (SFAS No. 123 was adopted as of October 1, 2002); and an expense of $62,000 for options issued prior to October 1, 2002 accounted for under the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles Board #25 ("APB 25"). The expense for the three months ended December 31, 2001 of $405,000 relates to options accounted for under APB 25.   Restructuring Expense.  The Company recognized a restructuring expense of $538,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, related to the plan to close its corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California.   Income Taxes.  The Company made no provision for federal income taxes for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, as a result of the Company's continuing losses.  For the quarter ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a $1,000 provision for state and local taxes attributed to IAHC.   Loss from Discontinued Operations.  As a result of the decision by the Board of Directors to discontinue the operations of Intellicom on March 29, 2002, the loss on operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2001 of $928,000 has been reclassified as loss from discontinued operations.   Loss on Disposition. Loss on disposition increased $885,000 to $1,475,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, compared to $590,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2001. The loss is primarily attributable to an arbitration award on MTC, a settlement on Aerzone, and additional reserves on Intellicom related to the lease obligations of the Livermore facility.   Net Loss.  The Company had a net loss of $7,052,000 or a net loss per share of $0.84, for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, compared to a net loss of $2,780,000 or a net loss per share of $0.33, for the three months ended December 31, 2001.  There was no gain or loss from discontinued operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2001.          LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $47,499,000 in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, net of amounts due to brokers compared with $40,498,000 as of December 31, 2003.   Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 was $8,447,000.  Net cash flows benefited from premium volume and fees from MGUs, partially offset by higher than expected claims and losses.   Net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations for fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 was $7,577,000.  This use of cash results from purchases of fixed maturities, equity securities, and short-term investments, net of sales of all such securities.  The Company also acquired ICH-MidAtlantic and a 23% equity interest in Majestic.    	Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 was $198,000, resulting from the exercise of common stock options.   The Company believes it has sufficient cash to meet its presently anticipated business requirements over the next twelve months including the funding of discontinued operations, working capital requirements, and capital investments.               LIQUIDITY   Independence American   	IAIC principally derives cash flow from: (i) operations; (ii) the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed income securities; and (iii) earnings on investments.  Such cash flow is partially used to finance liabilities for insurance policy benefits and reinsurance obligations.     IAIC maintains a revolving Letter of Credit ("LOC") with a financial institution to support reinsurance obligations of IAIC in the ordinary course of business.  The LOC has an outstanding face up to $5,000,000 although IAIC has not drawn upon funds to date.  The LOC renews October 15 of each year, unless cancelled by IAIC.     Corporate   Corporate derives cash flow funds principally from: dividends and tax payments from its subsidiaries and investment income from Corporate liquidity.  There are no regulatory constraints on the MGUs' ability to dividend to the parent company, however, state insurance laws have provisions relating to the ability of the parent company to use cash generated by IAIC.   Asset Quality      	The nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders.  Of the aggregate carrying value of the Company's investment assets, approximately 95% was invested in investment grade fixed income securities, resale agreements, and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004.  Also at such date, 99% of the Company's fixed maturities were investment grade.  These investments carry less default risk and, therefore, lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments.  At December 31, 2004, 1% of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in diversified non-investment grade fixed income securities.   Investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities, including greater risk of loss upon default, and thinner trading markets.  The Company does not have any non-performing fixed maturities.  The composition of the Company's fixed maturities at December 31, 2004, utilizing Standard and Poor's rating categories, was as follows:     GRADE               % INVESTED                    AAA            63%    AA            -    A            12%    BBB            24%    BB or lower            1%                100%          Investment Impairments   	The Company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments.  For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded a realized loss for other than temporary impairments of $134,000 and $0 respectively.  The Company's gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled $500,000 at December 31, 2004.  Substantially all of these securities were investment grade. The unrealized losses have been evaluated in accordance with the Company's policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at December 31, 2004. The Company holds all fixed maturities as available-for-sale and accordingly marks all of its securities to market through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).       Risk Management     	The Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities. Options may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets; see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   The following summarizes the estimated pre-tax change in fair value (based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the U.S. Treasury yield curve) of the fixed income portfolio assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at December 31, 2004:                     Estimated  Fair         Estimated   Change    Change in Interest Rates            Value         In Fair Value                (in thousands)    200 basis point rise         $   30,647      $   (3,359)    100 basis point rise            32,515         (1,491)    Base scenario            34,006         -    100 basis point decline            35,266         1,260    200 basis point decline            36,689         2,683        	 The Company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the Company will not be adversely affected by its current investments.     	In the Company's analysis of the asset-liability model, a 100 to 200 basis point change in interest rates on the Company's liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company. With respect to its investments, the Company employs (from time to time as warranted) investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures.                           Balance Sheet   	Total investments increased $ 6,211,000 to $44,469,000 at December 31, 2004 from $38,258,000 at December 31, 2003, due to the net growth in the business. The $6,339,000 increase in total stockholders' equity is mainly due to net income generated during fiscal 2004.   	The Company had receivables from reinsurers of $13,496,000 at December 31, 2004.  Substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration.  All of such receivables are either due from highly rated companies or are adequately secured.  No allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary at December 31, 2004.        CAPITAL RESOURCES   	Due to its strong capital ratio and excellent asset quality and credit-worthiness, the Company remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities. It is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity. In the event additional funds are required, it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable.   In accordance with SFAS No. 115, the Company may carry its portfolio of fixed income securities either as held to maturity (carried at amortized cost), as trading securities (carried at fair value) or as available-for-sale (carried at fair value).  The Company has chosen to carry all of its debt securities as available-for-sale.  The Company experienced a change in net unrealized loss of $219,000 reflecting a net unrealized loss of $285,000 at December 31, 2004 from a net unrealized loss of $66,000 at December 31, 2003.  From time to time, as warranted, the Company employs investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures.   The Company enters into a variety of contractual obligations with third-parties in the ordinary course of its operations.  These obligations, as of December 31, 2004, are set forth in the table below.   Insurance reserves all represent short-tail business.  However, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be fully assessed based upon an analysis of these obligations.  Future cash outflows, whether they are contractual obligations or not, also will vary based upon our future needs.  Although some outflows are fixed, others depend on future events.  The Company has expected contractual obligations relating to non-cancelable leases and insurance reserves of the following at December 31, 2004 (in thousands):        Year Ending         Operating       Insurance        December 31,         Lease      Reserves       2005      $   779   $   22,240       2006         444      -       2007         440      -       2008         353      -       2009          255      -       2010 and thereafter         111      -    Total      $   2,382   $   22,240           Under certain circumstances set forth in the Limited Liability Company Agreements of Marlton and Majestic, the Company has the right and/or obligation to purchase some or all of the minority interests in Marlton and Majestic.             OUTLOOK   	Independence American, which is domiciled in Delaware, is licensed to write property and/or casualty insurance in 33 states and the District of Columbia, and has a B+ (Very Good) rating from A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best"). An A.M. Best rating is assigned after an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company's financial condition and operating performance, and is also based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries, and is not directed towards protection of investors. A.M. Best ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities of the Company.   Independence American is primarily a reinsurer, and currently derives most of its business from long-term reinsurance treaties with IHC's carriers.  In addition to Medical Stop-Loss, Independence American also began to reinsure in 2004 a short-term statutory disability benefit product ("DBL") in New York, and will reinsure several additional IHC products in 2005, including 5% of a $50,000,000 block of employer-sponsored group major medical business.  This block was recently 100% reinsured by Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York from another carrier.  In addition, in 2005, Independence American will reinsure up to 10% of IHC's employer-sponsored group major medical, short-term medical, dental and vision business.  The short-term medical will be administered by Health Plan Administrators, Inc. ("HPA"), a market leader in this product, which is now affiliated with IHC.  The employer-sponsored group major medical will be marketed and administered by Insurers Administrative Corp oration, a market leader in consumer-driven medical plans for small and medium size employer groups.      Independence American is also positioning itself to be an issuing carrier of Medical Stop-Loss and short-term medical.  Currently, it has approved employer Medical Stop-Loss policies in 24 states and approved provider excess loss policies in 13 states. It is also in the process of filing a short-term medical product in 30 states for the continUcare program and otherwise.   Independence American is actively seeking more licenses and product approvals.   The Medical Stop-Loss market is generally cyclical in nature. When a product experiences several consecutive years of underwriting profitability, it is not unusual for there to be more competitors entering that line which can increase pressure on pricing and create a "softer" market. The Medical Stop-Loss market began to "soften" in 2003 and less favorable conditions continued through 2004.  Despite these market conditions, the Company produced profitable results in 2003 and 2004, and expects continued profitability in 2005.  However, profit sharing commissions for 2005 and future years may be adversely affected by higher loss ratios for business written in 2003 and 2004 for certain of the MGUs.  As a result of these market conditions, the rate that the carriers that cede business to the Company were able to charge for Medical Stop-Loss increased at a lesser rate in recent years, however, increases in medical trend have also been held in check to a greater extent and deductibles and attach ment points have increased. This reduces the risk taker's overall risk exposure.  Independence American remains optimistic that it will continue to produce profitable results due to stricter underwriting guidelines, and it will be able to grow the Medical Stop-Loss line in 2005 due to higher retention.  The MGUs, however, expect that their production will decrease in 2005 as a result of these guidelines.  This will adversely affect MGU income in 2005, but could produce higher profit sharing revenue in future years, subject to any profit commission loss carryforwards.  The new lines of business (major medical, short-term medical, dental an vision) that the Company will reinsure in 2005 are less volatile than Medical Stop-Loss.  The Company is optimistic that these lines will yield profitable results and diversify Independence American's product mix.      Madison National and Independence American entered into a reinsurance agreement to protect Independence American against losses (excluding terrorism and extra-contractual obligations) occurring during the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. In the event that Independence American's claims, loss adjustment expenses, and incurred but not reported reserves ("Net Losses") exceeds 95% of the net premiums earned by Independence American, then Madison National will pay Independence American an amount equal to the excess over the Net Losses. In no event shall Madison National pay Independence American more than $5,000,000.  Independence American will pay Madison National, quarterly, a premium of .175% of net retained premium subject to a minimum premium of $50,000 and a maximum premium of $100,000.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS No. 123R"), "Share-Based Payment" which revised SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." The revised statement addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees and other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB 25 and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The revised statement is effective as of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company already applies the fair value based method of accounting for all stock based compensation issued after October 1, 2002. At December 31, 2004 all such share accounted for under APB 25 were fully v ested or expired.       On September 30, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Issued Staff Position No. EITF Issue 03-1-1, "Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments," which delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 03-1. EITF Issue No. 03-1 provides guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired and was originally to be effective for other-than-temporary impairment evaluations made in reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004 (July 1, 2004 for the Company). The delay in the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in EITF Issue No. 03-1 does not suspend the requirement to recognize other-than-temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature. Subsequent to the issuance of Sta ff Position No. EITF Issue 03-1-1, the FASB announced plans for a full reconsideration of existing authoritative literature concerning other-than-temporary impairment of securities.  The outcome of this reconsideration and the impact, if any, on the Company's impairment recognition cannot be predicted at this time.                SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT   	From time to time, information provided by the Company, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on behalf of the Company, may contain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company's control, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated. Set forth below are important factors that could cause the Company's results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.     RISK FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS and FINANCIAL CONDITION     The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company's business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company's common stock could decline.        IHC Will Exercise Significant Influence Over the Company's Business and Affairs, Which May Result in Potential Conflicts of Interest Between IHC and the Company; Reliance on IHC's Expertise  	The Company's operations are being directed by IHC management and employees, which may result in potential conflicts of interest between IHC and the Company.  For example, a conflict may arise if IHC were to engage in activities or pursue corporation opportunities that overlap with the Company's business.  Because IHC's management will also constitute the Company's management, these individuals will have fiduciary duties to both companies, which could result in conflicts of interest, including the Company foregoing opportunities or taking actions that disproportionately benefit IHC.  IHC will also have at least two representatives on the Company's Board of Directors who will have similar conflicts of interest.  In addition, the Company is relying upon the management and expertise of officers of IHC who also serve as officers of the Company.     The Occurrence of Various Events May Adversely Affect the Company's Ability to Utilize Fully Its Tax Net Operating Loss Carryforwards.  	The Company has U.S. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $280 million, which may be used against any profits from the Company's business.  However, events outside of the control of the Company or IHC, such as certain acquisitions and dispositions of the Company's common stock, may limit the use of all or a portion of the Company's tax net operating loss carryforwards.  If such events were to occur, the Company's expectation of using its tax net operating loss carryforwards against potential profits would not be realized and the Company could potentially have a higher tax liability in the future than it would otherwise have had.      Stock Transfer Restrictions   	Although the stock transfer restrictions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation are intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change, it will not prevent all transfers that might result in an "ownership change."  Furthermore, certain changes in relationships and other events not addressed by the stock transfer restrictions could cause AMIC to undergo an "ownership change."  Section 382 of the Code is an extremely complex provision with respect to which there are many uncertainties.  In addition, AMIC has not requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the effectiveness of the stock transfer restrictions and, therefore, AMIC cannot be certain that the IRS will agree that the stock transfer restrictions are effective for purposes of Section 382 of the Code.  Further, AMIC cannot assure that the stock transfer restrictions or portions thereof will be enforceable in Delaware courts or that the IRS would agree that all of AMIC's tax net operating loss carryforwards are  allowable.  In addition, AMIC's board of directors may determine, in its sole discretion, to permit a restricted transfer that results in an "ownership change" if it determines that such transfer is in the best interests of AMIC.  Therefore, the stock transfer restrictions were to reduce, but not necessary eliminate, the risk that Section 382 of the Code will cause limitations on the use of tax attributes of AMIC.     Results May Fluctuate as a Result of Factors Generally Affecting the Insurance and Reinsurance Industry  The results of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties.  Factors that affect the industry in general could also cause results to fluctuate.  The industry's and the Company's financial condition and results of operations may be affected significantly by:      Fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment, which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of loss amounts;  Rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products;  Events like the September 11, 2001 attacks, which affected the insurance and reinsurance markets generally;  Changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise and the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers' liability; and  The overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry.    Decrease in Rates for Reinsurance and Insurance Could Reduce Net Income  	Independence American, the Company's insurance subsidiary, primarily reinsures medical stop loss insurance.  Rates for medical stop loss insurance and reinsurance are influenced primarily by factors that are outside of Independence American's control and historically have been highly cyclical.  Any significant decrease in the rates for medical stop loss insurance or reinsurance could reduce the Company's net income.  If the Rating Agencies Downgrade Independence American, the Company's Results of Operations and Competitive Position in the Industry May Suffer  	Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Independence American is rated B+ (Very Good) by A.M. Best Company, Inc., whose ratings reflect its opinions of an insurance company's financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders, and are not evaluations directed to investors. The rating of Independence American is subject to periodic review by A.M. Best Company, Inc., and the Company is not assured of the continued retention of this rating.  If A.M. Best Company, Inc. reduces Independence American's ratings from its current levels, the Company's business would be adversely affected.  The Company's Insurance Reserves are Based on an Estimate of Its Future Liability, and if Actual Claims Prove to be Greater Than Reserves, the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition May be Adversely Affected.  	The Company maintains insurance reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees as well as a portion of its general expenses, for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period.  Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, the Company cannot assure that current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.  If the Company reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, it would have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings, and these charges could be material. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability.  Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what the Company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost.  These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as es timates of future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors.  These variables are affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial trends and legislative changes.  Many of these items are not directly quantifiable in advance.   Additionally, there may be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported.  The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities, particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made.  Reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled.  Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed.     Inability to Assess Underwriting Risk Accurately Could Reduce Its Net Income  	The Company's success is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained.  If the Company fails to assess accurately the risks it retains, it may fail to establish the appropriate premium rates and its reserves may be inadequate to cover its losses, requiring augmentation of the Company reserves.  If the Company is Unsuccessful in Competing Against Larger or More Well-Established Competitors, Its Results of Operations and Financial Condition Will Be Adversely Affected  	The Company's industry is highly competitive and has experienced severe price competition from time to time over the last several years.  The Company faces competition from domestic and international insurance and reinsurance companies, underwriting agencies, and from diversified financial services companies that are significantly larger than the Company.  Some of these competitors have greater financial, marketing and other resources, have been operating longer than the Company and have established long-term and continuing business relationships through the industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage.  In addition to competition in the operation of its business, the Company faces competition from a variety of sources in attracting and retaining qualified employees.  The Company cannot assure that it will maintain its current competitive position in the markets in which it operates, or that it will be able to expand its operations into new markets and compete eff ectively in the future.  If the Company fails to do so, its business could be materially adversely affected.   If the Company Fails to Comply with Extensive State and Federal Regulations, It Will Be Subject to Penalties, Which May Include Fines and Suspension and Which May Adversely Affect its Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  	The Company is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors.  This regulation, generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which it does business, relates to, among other things:    Approval of policy forms and premium rates;  Standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements, which are a measure developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and used by state insurance regulators to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized;  Licensing of insurers and their agents;  Restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;  Restrictions on the ability of Independence American to pay dividends to the Company;  Restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates;  Restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy;  Requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;  Requiring certain methods of accounting;  Prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and  Requiring reserves for losses and other purposes.   State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters.  The Company's business depends on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and its ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for its operations.  Regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, or revoke licenses and approvals.    Regulatory authorities may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation or regulations.  In some instances, the Company follows practices based on its interpretations of regulations, or those that it believes to be generally followed by the industry, which may be different from the requirements or interpretations of regulatory authorities.  If the Company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals and does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend it from carrying on some or all of its activities or otherwise penalize it.  That type of action could have a material adverse effect on its business. Also, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry (whether federal, state or foreign), or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.  Certain Proposed Federal and State Legislation May, if Adopted, Adversely Affect the Company's Reinsurance of Medical Stop-Loss.  	Individuals who obtain health coverage through self-insured plans cannot currently sue their employer in state court for punitive or compensatory damages, but can seek legal recourse in federal court where an employer can be ordered to cover a wrongfully-denied benefit.  In the continuing debate over health care reform, certain federal and state legislation has been proposed which could have the effect of making plan sponsors, administrators, or certain other parties liable for punitive damages in state court.  While the Company cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or what, if any, impact enactment of any of these would have on its reinsurance of Medical Stop-Loss, the number of employers offering health benefits or choosing self-insured plans could be reduced, plans could increase the portion paid by employees (thereby reducing participation), pricing and coverage options could be affected, and the Company could be faced with greater liability exposure .  Decreases in the Fair Market Value of Fixed Income Securities May Greatly Reduce the Value of the Company's Investment Portfolio, and as a Result, the Company's Financial Condition May Suffer  	At December 31, 2004, $34.0 million of the Company's $44.5 million investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities.  The fair market value of these fixed income securities and the investment income from these fixed income securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions.  With respect to the Company's investments in fixed income securities, the fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by the Company from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates.  In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.  An investment has prepayment risk when ther e is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates.  Historically, the impact of market fluctuations has affected the Company's financial statements.  Because all of the Company's fixed income securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the fair market value of the Company's securities are reflected in the Company's other comprehensive income.  Similar treatment is not available for liabilities.  Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could aversely affect the Company's stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income (loss) and/or cash flows.           Regulatory Restrictions Limit the Company's Ability to Obtain Dividends from Independence American  	One of the Company's principal assets through its ownership of IAHC, is the shares of capital stock of Independence American. The Company may rely on dividends from Independence American to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses.  The payment of dividends by Independence American is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of Independence American, as well as the regulatory restrictions.  As a result, should the Company's other sources of funds prove to be inadequate.  The Company may not be able to receive dividends from Independence American at times and in amounts necessary to meet its obligations.  Prospective Anti-Takeover Provisions Could Negatively Impact the Company's Stockholders  	The Company is a Delaware corporation.  The Delaware General Corporation Law contains certain provisions that may discourage or delay a change in control of the Company, make a change in control the Company more difficult or prevent the removal of incumbent directors.  In addition, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain certain provisions that have the same or a similar effect.  These provisions may have a negative impact on the price of the Company's common stock and may discourage third-party bidders from making a bid for the Company or may reduce any premiums paid to stockholders for their common stock.      Item 7A.
