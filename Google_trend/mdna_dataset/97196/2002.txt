OVERVIEW  On July 30, 2002, SoftNet Systems, Inc., and subsidiaries (collectively referred to  as  the  "Company")  entered  into  an  agreement  to acquire First Standard Holdings  Corp.  from  SSH  Corp.  and  Independence Holding Company ("IHC") for $31,920,000  in  cash.  Subsequently  at  the Special Meeting of Stockholders on November  14,  2002,  the  Company's  stockholders  approved  the stock purchase agreement between the Company, SSH Corp. and IHC (the "Purchase Agreement"), and approved  the  Company's  name  change  to  American Independence Corp.  Also on November  14, 2002, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the Purchase  Agreement  and  First  Standard  Holdings  Corp.  changed  its name to Independence  American  Holdings  Corp.  ("IAHC").  IAHC  and  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries  are  engaged  in  the  insurance  and  reinsurance  business.  The Company,  which  was a holding company principally engaged in providing Internet services,  had  previously  wound  down its Internet related businesses and as a result  of  the  acquisition  of  IAHC  has become an insurance holding company. Additionally,  due  to the acquisition of IAHC, the Company has decided to close its  offices in San Francisco, terminate all but one of its employees, and enter into  a services agreement with IHC under which the Company's operations will be directed  by  IHC  management  and  employees.  The  transaction  is  more fully described in the Company's Definitive Proxy/Prospectus Statement on Schedule 14A as  filed  with  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission  on  September  30, 2002.  In  a  separate  transaction  on  July  30,  2002,  IHC acquired Pacific Century Cyberworks  Limited's  ("PCCW")  entire  interest  in  the Company consisting of 5,000,000  common  stock  shares  at  $3.00  per  share  for  a  total  value of $15,000,000.  As  a  result  of  this  transaction, PCCW's appointees Linus W.L. Cheung and Jeffrey A. Bowden resigned from the Company's Board of Directors, and Edward  Netter,  Chairman  of  IHC,  and  Roy  T.K.  Thung,  President and Chief Executive  Officer  of  IHC, were appointed to the Company's Board of Directors. Additionally,  upon  closing  of  the purchase of IAHC, IHC has agreed to make a cash  tender  offer at $3.00 per share for at least 3,000,000 outstanding common stock  shares  of  the  Company,  subject  to  certain  limitations.  On  May  17,  2002,  the  Company  received  a Nasdaq Staff Determination Letter stating  that  the  Company's  common stock was no longer eligible for continued listing  on  the  Nasdaq  National Market as a result of the Company ceasing the operations  of  its  last  business  segment,  Intellicom,  and that the Company therefore  did  not  meet  the  requirements  for continued listing set forth in Marketplace  Rules  4300  and 4330.  Subsequently, the Company requested and was granted  an  oral hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to appeal the  Nasdaq  Staff  Determination  Letter,  which  stayed  the  delisting of the Company's  common  stock  pending the outcome of the hearing.  On July 12, 2002, the  Company  appeared before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to present the Company's plan to acquire IAHC, which would allow the Company to comply with the  Marketplace  Rules  4300  and 4330.  On August 15, 2002, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel informed the Company that the Company will remain listed on Nasdaq,  subject  to meeting various conditions, including the completion of the acquisition  of IAHC by December 31, 2002.  Nasdaq has also informed the Company that  if it does remain listed on Nasdaq, following the acquisition of IAHC, the Company  will  be required to meet Nasdaq's initial listing requirements as well as  Nasdaq's  continued  listing  requirements.                                         -13-  As  of September 30, 2002, the Company had substantially completed the wind down of  its  Internet  services  related  subsidiaries,  ISP  Channel,  Inc.  ("ISP Channel"),  Intelligent  Communications,  Inc.  ("Intellicom"),  and  Aerzone Corporation  ("Aerzone"),  including  Laptop  Lane Limited ("Laptop Lane"), as a result  of  the  following:  On  December  7,  2000,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors approved a plan to discontinue  its  ISP Channel operations because of (1) the consolidation in the cable  industry  made  it  difficult for ISP Channel to achieve the economies of scale  necessary to provide such services profitably, and (2) the Company was no longer  able  to bear the costs of maintaining the ISP Channel.  Subsequently on December  19,  2000,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  approved  a  plan to discontinue  its  Aerzone,  including  Laptop  Lane, business in light of, among other things, significant long-term capital needs and the difficulty of securing the  necessary  financing because of the financial markets.  In conjunction with discontinuing  the  ISP  Channel  and Aerzone businesses, the Company's Board of Directors  on  December  28,  2000,  approved  a  plan  to  reduce its corporate headquarters  staff.  On  March  29,  2002,  the  Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Intellicom, entered  into  an agreement to sell its operating business and certain assets to Loral  Cyberstar, Inc.  Following the sale of its operating business and certain assets  to  Loral  Cyberstar, Inc., the Company's Board of Directors unanimously agreed  to cease the operations of Intellicom on April 3, 2002.  Subsequently on April  22,  2002, Intellicom entered into an agreement to sell certain assets to Native  Intellicom,  Inc.,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Pinoleville Band of Pomo Indians, for cash, subject to the termination of Intellicom's lease for its facility in Livermore, California.  On August 1, 2002, Intellicom terminated the agreement  with  the Pinoleville Band of Pomo Indians and is negotiating to sell those  assets  to  another  group  of  Native  Americans.  The  Company  reports  operating expenses in several categories: (i) selling and marketing;  (ii)  engineering; and (iii) general and administrative costs.  Also included  in  operating  expenses  are  depreciation  and  non-cash compensation expense  related  to  stock  options.  Non-cash  compensation expense related to stock  options  relates  primarily  to  the  amortization  of  deferred  stock compensation  resulting  from  below  market value stock options granted between October  1998  and  March  1999.  The  results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, have been  reclassified  for  the  effects  of discontinued operations of Intellicom.                                         -14-  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  The  preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America  requires  management  to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  amounts  of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of  the revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ  from  those  estimates.  The  Company  believes  the  following critical accounting  policies  are  significantly  affected by judgments, assumptions and estimates  used  in preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  For a detailed  discussion  on the application of these and other accounting policies, see  Note  2  to  the consolidated financial statements of the Company appearing elsewhere  in  this  annual  report  on  Form  10-K.

Under APB 30, the Company  accrued  estimates  of  expected  liabilities  related  to discontinued operations  through its eventual discharge.  The estimated remaining liabilities related to discontinued operations include contract terminations, litigation and loss  from operations subsequent to September 30, 2002.  The Company reviews the estimated  closure  costs liability on a quarterly basis to determine changes in the  costs  of  the  discontinued  operations  activities.  Restructuring  Expense  The  Company  recorded  restructuring  expenses  related  to an approved plan to reduce  corporate  headquarters  staff  and to relocate its corporate offices in conjunction  with  discontinuing  the  Aerzone,  ISP  Channel  and  Intellicom businesses.  These restructuring expenses are based on estimates of the expected costs  associated  with  employee  severance,  lease  terminations, and facility relocation.  The  Company reviews the estimated restructuring costs accrual on a quarterly  basis  to  determine  changes  in  the  costs  of  the  restructuring activities.  Impairment  of  Long-lived  Assets  The  Company  evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever current events or  changes  in  circumstances,  as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  No.  121  ("SFAS  121"),  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  and  for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, indicate that the carrying value  of  an  asset  may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows  attributable  to that asset.  The amount of any impairment is measured as the  difference  between  the  carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.  Short-term  Investments  The  Company  accounts  for  its  short-term  investments  in  debt  and  equity securities  under  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS 115"),  Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity Securities. Short-term  investments  generally  consist  of  highly  liquid  securities with original  maturities  in excess of three months.  The Company has classified its short-term  investments  as  available-for-sale  securities.  These  short-term investments  are  carried  at  fair  value  based  on  quoted market prices with unrealized  gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss of the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Realized  gains and losses on short-term investments are computed using the specific identification method and are  reported  in  miscellaneous  income  (expense),  net  of  the  accompanying consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Declines  in  value  judged  to  be other-than-temporary  is  determined based on the specific identification method and  are  reported  in  loss  in  disposition  of  equity  investments  of  the accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations.                                         -15-  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  FOR  THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, COMPARED TO THE YEAR  ENDED  SEPTEMBER  30,  2001  Selling  and  Marketing.

The - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Company  recognized  a gain of $1,326,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001, resulting  from the cash payment made in lieu of the Company's obligation to pay off  the  8.5%  promissory note and related interest, and to settle the business acquisition  liability  to  former  Intellicom  stockholders  with common stock.  Net Loss.  The Company had a net loss of $57,647,000, or a net loss per share of - --------- $2.31,  for  the  year  ended  September  30,  2001,  compared  to a net loss of $232,353,000, or a net loss per share of $9.88, for the year ended September 30, 2000.                                         -18-  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES  Since September 1998, the Company has funded the significant negative cash flows from its subsidiary operating activities and the associated capital expenditures through  a  combination  of  public  and  private equity sales, convertible debt issues and equipment leases.  At September 30, 2002, the Company had $62,059,000 in  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments compared with $75,454,000 at  September  30,  2001.  Net  cash  used  in  operating  activities of continuing operations for the year ended  September  30,  2002,  was  $7,425,000.  This  results from a net loss of $8,830,000  from  continuing  operations,  net  increase  in operating assets of $848,000  and  a  net decrease in operating liabilities of $1,055,000, offset by several  non-cash  items  including  loss  on  write  down of impaired assets of $352,000,  loss  on disposition of equity investments of $733,000, provision for restructuring  costs  of  $502,000,  amortization of deferred stock compensation expense  of  $1,466,000, and depreciation expense of $189,000.  Net cash used in operating  activities  of  discontinued  operations  was  $4,721,000.  Net  cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations for the year ended  September  30,  2002,  was  $19,841,000,  and  was  primarily provided by proceeds  from maturities and sales of short-term investments, net of purchases. Net  cash  used  in  investing activities of discontinued operations was $2,000.  Net  cash  used  in  financing  activities of continuing operations for the year ended  September  30, 2002, was $1,444,000, resulting from the payment of the 5% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures  due  September  30,  2002,  to Mr. R.C.W. Mauran.  Net  cash  used  in financing activities of discontinued operations was $60,000.  The  Company  believes  it has sufficient cash to meet its presently anticipated business  requirements  over  the  next  twelve  months including the funding of operating  losses,  discontinued  operations,  working capital requirements, and capital  investments.  The Company expects significant reductions in cash usages from  its  discontinued  operating  activities for the year ending September 30, 2003.  Acquisition  and  Discontinued  Operations of Intellicom. On February 9, 1999, a - --------------------------------------------------------- wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company merged with and into Intellicom (the "Intellicom  Acquisition").  The  Intellicom Acquisition was accounted for under the  purchase  method,  and  the results of Intellicom have been included in the consolidated  financial  statements since the date of acquisition.  The purchase price  of  $14,869,000  was  comprised of: (i) a cash component of $500,000 (the "Cash  Consideration");  (ii)  a  promissory  note  in  the amount of $1,000,000 bearing  interest  at  7.5% per annum and due one year after closing (the "First Promissory  Note");  (iii) a promissory note in the amount of $2,000,000 bearing interest  at  8.5%  per  annum  and  due  two  years  after closing (the "Second Promissory  Note",  together  with  the First Promissory Note are defined as the "Debt  Consideration");  (iv)  the  issuance  of 500,000 shares of the Company's common  stock  (adjustable  upwards  after  one  year in certain circumstances), valued  at  $14.938  per  share,  for  a total value of $7,469,000 (the "Closing Shares");  (v) additional shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon the first,  second  and  third  anniversaries  of  the closing, valued at a total of $3,500,000  (the  "Anniversary  Shares",  together  with  the Closing Shares are defined  as  the  "Equity  Consideration");  and (vi) certain direct acquisition costs  totaling  $400,000.  The  Debt  Consideration  may be partially or wholly converted  into  the  Company's  common stock, under certain circumstances.  The conversion  price  of  the Debt Consideration was based upon the average closing price  of  the  Company's common stock for the 15 days immediately preceding the conversion  date.  In  April  1999, the Company paid the First Promissory Note and related interest in  full  with a combination $832,000 in cash and the remainder, after expenses, with  6,118  common stock shares valued at $190,000.  The Intellicom Acquisition agreement required the Company to issue $1,500,000 of common stock shares on the first  anniversary date of the Intellicom Acquisition.  Accordingly, on February 8,  2000, the Company issued 43,314 common stock shares valued at $1,499,000 and paid  $1,000  for  fractional  shares to the former Intellicom stockholders.  On February  7,  2001,  the  Company  made  an  offer  to  the  former  Intellicom stockholders  to  pay a discounted amount in lieu of the Company's obligation to pay  cash  and  stock  for  the remaining consideration, which was to be paid in connection  with  the  Intellicom  acquisition and consisted of (i) a $2,000,000 8.5%  promissory note and accrued interest, (ii) the requirement for the Company to issue $1,500,000 of common stock shares on the second anniversary date of the Intellicom  acquisition,  and  (iii)  the  requirement  for the Company to issue $500,000  of common stock shares on the third anniversary date of the Intellicom acquisition.  The  parties  agreed to settle the obligation by which the Company paid  $2,815,000  (including accrued interest of $325,000), issued 99,922 common stock  shares valued at $199,000, and recognized a $1,326,000 extraordinary gain on  settlements  of  outstanding  obligations.  On February 9, 2002, the Company issued 12,426 common stock shares to settle the remaining obligations related to the  requirement  to  issue common stock shares on the third anniversary date of the  Intellicom  acquisition.                                         -19-  Additionally,  the  Intellicom  Acquisition  agreement  included a demonstration bonus  ("Demonstration  Bonus")  of  $1,000,000 payable in cash or shares of the Company's  common stock at the Company's option by the first anniversary date of the Intellicom Acquisition if certain conditions were met.  On February 8, 2000, the  opportunity  to  earn the Demonstration Bonus had expired, and accordingly, the  Demonstration  Bonus  was  not  paid  or  included in the purchase price of Intellicom.  On  March  29,  2002,  the  Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Intellicom, entered  into  an agreement to sell its operating business and certain assets to Loral  Cyberstar, Inc.  Following the sale of its operating business and certain assets  to  Loral  Cyberstar, Inc., the Company's Board of Directors unanimously agreed  to cease the operations of Intellicom on April 3, 2002.  Subsequently on April  22,  2002, Intellicom entered into an agreement to sell certain assets to Native  Intellicom,  Inc.,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Pinoleville Band of Pomo Indians, for cash, subject to the termination of Intellicom's lease for its facility  in Livermore, California.  On August 1, 2002 Intellicom terminated the agreement with the Pinoleville Band of Pomo Indians and is negotiating to a sell those  assets  to  another  group of Native Americans.  The operating results of Intellicom have been segregated from continuing operations and are reported as a loss from discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  Although  it is difficult to predict the final results, the loss on disposition  from  discontinued  operations  includes  management's estimates of costs  to  wind  down the business, costs to settle its outstanding liabilities, and  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of assets.  The actual results could differ materially  from these estimates.  The assets and liabilities of such operations are  reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued operations of the accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets at September 30, 2002 and 2001.  The Company  recorded  an  estimated loss on disposition of Intellicom of $3,120,000 for  the  year  ended  September  30,  2002.  The  estimated loss on disposition reserve  of  Intellicom  is  reflected  in  net  liabilities  associated  with discontinued  operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets at September  30,  2002,  and  the  corresponding  charge  is  reflected in loss on disposition  of  discontinued  operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated statements  of  operations  for  the  years  ended  September  30,  2002.  Formation of Aerzone, Acquisition of Laptop Lane, and Discontinued Operations of - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aerzone.  On  January  24,  2000,  the Company founded Aerzone (formerly SoftNet - -------- Zone,  Inc.),  a  Delaware corporation, to provide high-speed Internet access to global  business  travelers.  As  part  of  the  Aerzone  business,  the Company acquired  Laptop  Lane,  a  Washington  corporation,  on  April  21,  2000.  The acquisition  was  accounted  for  under  the purchase method, and the results of Laptop  Lane  have  been included in the consolidated financial statements since the  date  of acquisition.  Laptop Lane is a leading provider of business center services  in airports.  The Company paid approximately $21,559,000 consisting of (i)  972,266  common  stock  shares of the Company valued at $15,107,000, net of adjustment  for expenses paid by the Company on behalf of Laptop Lane, exchanged for  all outstanding common stock shares of Laptop Lane, (ii) direct acquisition costs of approximately $2,300,000, which included a bonus payment to Laptop Lane employees  of  $431,000  in lieu of Laptop Lane stock options, and (iii) 250,000 common  stock shares of the Company valued at $3,652,000 issued to former Laptop Lane  stockholders  in  payment  for achieving certain criteria.  As part of the acquisition, an additional 333,333 common stock shares of the Company were to be distributed  to  former Laptop Lane stockholders if certain performance goals or other  criteria  were met.  As of September 30, 2000, Laptop Lane achieved three of  the  four performance goals; as a result, 249,981 common stock shares of the Company  and  cash amounting to $3,652,000 were distributed to the former Laptop Lane stockholders.  In October 2000, Laptop Lane achieved the fourth performance goal requirement, resulting in the distribution of 81,050 common stock shares of the  Company  valued  at  $332,000  to  the  former  Laptop  Lane  stockholders. Additionally,  in  connection  with  the  acquisition,  the  Company  provided $6,000,000  in  working capital to Laptop Lane, under a secured promissory note.  On December 19, 2000, the Company decided to discontinue the Aerzone business in light  of significant long-term capital needs and the difficulty of securing the necessary  financing because of the current state of the financial markets.  The operating results of Aerzone have been segregated from continuing operations and are  reported  as  loss  from  discontinued  operations  of  the  accompanying consolidated  statement  of  operations.  The  loss from discontinued operations includes management's estimates of the remaining costs to wind down the business and  costs to settle its outstanding liabilities.  The assets and liabilities of such  operations  are  reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued operations of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2002 and  2001.  For  the  year  ended  September  30,  2000, the Company recorded an estimated  loss  on disposition reserve of Aerzone of $42,200,000.  For the year ended  September  30,  2001,  the  Company  increased  the  estimated  loss  on                                         -20-  disposition  reserve  of  Aerzone  by  $14,906,000, primarily as a result of the Company  reducing  the  estimated  proceeds  from  the  sale  of Laptop Lane and increasing estimated discontinued operating costs.  For the year ended September 30,  2002, the Company increased the estimated loss on disposition of Aerzone by $750,000,  as  a  result  of  a  superior  court decision related to a breach of contract  and other legal matters.  The estimated loss on disposition reserve of Aerzone  is reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued operations of  the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2002 and 2001, and the corresponding charge is reflected in loss on disposition of discontinued operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated statements of operations for the years  ended  September  30,  2002,  2001  and  2000.  Discontinued  Operations  of  ISP  Channel.  On  December 7, 2000, the Company's - ------------------------------------------- Board of Directors approved a plan to discontinue providing cable-based Internet services through its ISP Channel subsidiary by December 31, 2000, because of (1) consolidation in the cable television industry made it difficult for ISP Channel to achieve the economies of scale necessary to provide such services profitably, and  (2) the Company was no longer able to bear the costs of maintaining the ISP Channel.  The  operating  results  of  ISP  Channel  have  been  segregated from continuing  operations  and are reported as loss from discontinued operations of the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  The  loss  from discontinued  operations  includes management's estimates of the remaining costs to  wind down the business, costs to settle its outstanding liabilities, and the proceeds from the sale of assets.  The assets and liabilities of such operations are  reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued operations of the accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets at September 30, 2002 and 2001.  For the  year  ended  September  30, 2000, the Company recorded an estimated loss on disposition reserve of ISP Channel of $97,200,000.  For the year ended September 30, 2001, the Company decreased the estimated loss on disposition reserve of ISP Channel by $10,008,000, primarily as a result of the Company experiencing better than  previously  estimated  contract settlements.  For the year ended September 30,  2002,  the Company reduced the estimated loss on disposition reserve of ISP Channel  by  $900,000,  primarily as a result of the Company experiencing better than  previously  estimated  contract  settlements.  The  estimated  loss  on disposition  reserve  of  ISP  Channel  is  reflected  in  net  liabilities  of discontinued  operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets at September  30,  2002  and  2001,  and  the  corresponding  benefit and charge is reflected  in loss on disposition of discontinued operations of the accompanying consolidated  statements  of  operations for the years ended September 30, 2002, 2001  and  2000.  Discontinued  Operations  of  Micrographic  Technology  Corporation  ("MTC")  As  a  result  of  a  preliminary arbitration decision related to a dispute with Applications  Informatiques  Multimedia and a dispute related to the sale of MTC to  Global  Information  Distribution  GmbH  ("GID"),  the  Company  recorded  a $1,127,000  estimated  loss  on  disposition  reserve  of MTC for the year ended September  30,  2002.  MTC  was previously owned by the Company, and was sold to GID  on September 30, 1999.  The estimated loss on disposition reserve of MTC is reflected  in  net  liabilities  associated  with discontinued operations of the accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet  at  September  30,  2002,  and  the corresponding  charge  is  reflected  in  loss  on  disposition  of discontinued operations of the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended  September  30,  2002.                                         -21-                  FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS  The  risks  and  uncertainties  described  below  are not the only ones that the Company  faces.  Additional  risks  and uncertainties not presently known to the Company  or  that  the  Company  currently  deems immaterial may also impair the Company's  business  operations.  If  any of the following risks actually occur, the  Company's  business,  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  In such case, the trading price of the Company's common  stock  could  decline,  and you may lose all or part of your investment.                                    COMPANY RISKS  IHC WILL EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND AFFAIRS, WHICH  MAY RESULT IN POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN IHC AND THE COMPANY  The  Company's  operations  are  being directed by IHC management and employees, which may result in potential conflicts of interest between IHC and the Company. For  example, a conflict may arise if IHC were to engage in activities or pursue corporate opportunities that overlap with the Company's business.  Because IHC's management will also constitute the Company's management, these individuals will have  fiduciary  duties  to  both  companies, which could result in conflicts of interest,  including  the Company foregoing opportunities or taking actions that disproportionately benefit IHC.  IHC will also have at least two representatives on the Company's Board of Directors who will have similar conflicts of interest. These  conflicts  could  harm  the  Company's  business.  THE  OCCURRENCE  OF VARIOUS EVENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO UTILIZE  FULLY  ITS  TAX  NET  OPERATING  LOSS  CARRYFORWARDS  One  of  the  potential  benefits  of  the  Company's acquisition of IAHC is the Company's  expectation  that  the  Company's U.S. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  of  approximately $264 million may be used against any subsequent profits  from  IAHC's  business.  However,  events outside of the control of the Company  or  IHC, such as certain acquisitions and dispositions of the Company's common  stock,  may  limit  the use of all or a portion of the Company's tax net operating  loss  carryforwards.  If  such  events  were  to occur, the Company's expectation  of using its tax net operating loss carryforwards against potential IAHC  profits  would  not  be  realized and the Company could potentially have a higher  tax  liability  in  the  future  than  it  would  otherwise  have  had.  AS  A  RESULT  OF THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF IAHC, THE COMPANY WILL OPERATE IN THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRY, AN INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY  OPERATED  The  Company  has  not  previously  operated  in  the  insurance and reinsurance industry.  As  such, the Company is faced with risks that are new to the Company and  which  may  adversely  affect the Company.  The Company is relying upon the management  and  expertise  of officers of IHC who will serve as officers of the Company  post-closing.  The  Company  cannot  assure you of the effect this will have  on  the  Company's  future  operating results or stock price.  These risks include  the  following:       IAHC's Results May Fluctuate as a Result of Factors Generally Affecting the      Insurance  and  Reinsurance  Industry       The  results  of  companies  in  the  insurance  and  reinsurance  industry      historically  have  been  subject  to  significant  fluctuations  and      uncertainties. Factors that affect the industry in general could also cause      IAHC's  results to fluctuate. The industry's and IAHC's financial condition      and  results  of  operations  may  be  affected  significantly  by:            -    Fluctuations  in interest rates, inflationary pressures and other                changes  in  the  investment environment, which affect returns on                invested  capital  and  may  impact  the  ultimate payout of loss                amounts;           -    Rising  levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at                the  time  they  price  their  products;           -    Events  like  the  September l1, 2001 attacks, which affected the                insurance  and  reinsurance  markets  generally;           -    Changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that                may  arise  and  the  development  of  judicial  interpretations                relating  to  the  scope  of  insurers'  liability;  and           -    The  overall  level  of  economic  activity  and  the competitive                environment  in  the  industry.                                         -22-       Decrease  in  Rates for Accident and Health Reinsurance and Insurance Could      Reduce  IAHC's  Net  Income       IAHC  primarily writes accident and health insurance and reinsurance. Rates      for  accident and health insurance and reinsurance are influenced primarily      by  factors  that  are outside of IAHC's control and historically have been      highly  cyclical.  Any  significant  decrease in the rates for accident and      health  insurance  or  reinsurance  could  reduce  IAHC's  net  income.       If  the  Rating Agencies Downgrade IAHC's Insurance Company, IAHC's Results      of  Operations  and  Competitive  Position  in  the  Industry  May  Suffer       Ratings  have  become  an increasingly important factor in establishing the      competitive  position  of  insurance companies. IAHC's insurance subsidiary      Independence  American Insurance Company ("Independence American") is rated      B+  (Very  Good)  by  A.M.  Best  Company,  Inc., whose ratings reflect its      opinions  of  an  insurance  company's  financial  strength,  operating      performance,  strategic  position,  and  ability to meet its obligations to      policyholders, and are not evaluations directed to investors. The rating of      Independence  American  is subject to periodic review by A.M. Best Company,      Inc., and IAHC cannot assure you of the continued retention of this rating.      If A.M. Best Company, Inc. reduces Independence American's ratings from its      current  levels,  IAHC's  business  would  be  adversely  affected.       IAHC's  Loss Reserves are Based on an Estimate of Its Future Liability, and      if  Actual  Claims Prove to be Greater Than IAHC's Reserves, Its Results of      Operations  and  Financial  Condition  May  Be  Adversely  Affected       IAHC maintains loss reserves to cover IAHC's estimated liability for unpaid      losses and loss adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees as well      as a portion of IAHC's general expenses, for reported and unreported claims      incurred  as of the end of each accounting period. Because setting reserves      is  inherently uncertain, IAHC cannot assure you that current reserves will      prove  adequate  in  light  of  subsequent  events.  If IAHC's reserves are      insufficient  to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, IAHC      would  have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings, and      these  charges  could  be  material.  Reserves  do  not  represent an exact      calculation  of  liability.  Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what      IAHC  expects  the  ultimate  settlement  and administration of claims will      cost.  These  estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are      based  on  IAHC's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well      as  estimates  of  future  trends  in  claims severity, frequency, judicial      theories  of  liability  and other factors. These variables are affected by      both  internal  and  external  events,  such  as changes in claims handling      procedures,  inflation,  judicial  trends  and legislative changes. Many of      these  items  are not directly quantifiable in advance. Additionally, there      may  be  a  significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured      event  and  the  time it is reported to IAHC. The inherent uncertainties of      estimating  reserves  are  greater  for  certain  types  of  liabilities,      particularly  those  in which the various considerations affecting the type      of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse      before  a  definitive determination of liability is made. Reserve estimates      are  continually  refined  in  a  regular and ongoing process as experience      develops  and  further  claims  are  reported  and  settled. Adjustments to      reserves  are  reflected  in  the  results  of  the  periods  in which such      estimates  are  changed.       IAHC's  Inability  to  Assess Underwriting Risk Accurately Could Reduce Its      Net  Income       IAHC's  success  is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks      associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained. If IAHC fails      to  assess  accurately the risks it retains, IAHC may fail to establish the      appropriate  premium  rates  and IAHC's reserves may be inadequate to cover      its  losses, requiring augmentation of IAHC's reserves, which in turn could      reduce  IAHC's  net  income.       If  IAHC  is  Unsuccessful  in  Competing  Against  Larger  or  More      Well-Established  Competitors,  IAHC's  Results of Operations and Financial      Condition  Will  Be  Adversely  Affected       IAHC's  industry  is  highly  competitive  and has experienced severe price      competition  from  time  to  time  over  the last several years. IAHC faces      competition  from  domestic  and  international  insurance  and reinsurance      companies,  underwriting  agencies, and from diversified financial services      companies  that  are  significantly  larger  than  IAHC.  Some  of  these      competitors  have  greater  financial,  marketing  and other resources than      IAHC,  have  been operating longer than IAHC and have established long-term      and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be      a  significant  competitive  advantage.  In  addition to competition in the      operation  of  IAHC's  business,  IAHC  faces competition from a variety of      sources in attracting and retaining qualified employees. IAHC cannot assure      you  that  it will maintain its current competitive position in the markets      in which it operates, or that it will be able to expand its operations into      new  markets and compete effectively in the future. If IAHC fails to do so,      its  business  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.                                         -23-       If  IAHC Fails to Comply With Extensive State and Federal Regulations, IAHC      Will  Be  Subject  to Penalties, Which May Include Fines and Suspension and      Which  May  Adversely  Affect  IAHC's  Results  of Operations and Financial      Condition.       IAHC  is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision. Most      insurance  regulations  are  designed  to  protect  the  interests  of      policyholders  rather  than  stockholders  and  other  investors.  This      regulation,  generally  administered  by  a department of insurance in each      state  in  which  IAHC  does  business,  relates  to,  among  other things:            -    Approval  of  policy  forms  and  premium  rates;           -    Standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements,                which  are  a  measure  developed  by the National Association of                Insurance Commissioners and used by state insurance regulators to                identify  insurance  companies  that potentially are inadequately                capitalized;           -    Licensing  of  insurers  and  their  agents;           -    Restrictions  on  the  nature,  quality  and  concentration  of                investments;           -    Restrictions  on the ability of Independence American's insurance                company  to  pay  dividends  to  IAHC;           -    Restrictions  on  transactions  between  insurance  companies and                their  affiliates;           -    Restrictions  on  the  size  of  risks  insurable  under a single                policy;           -    Requiring  deposits  for  the  benefit  of  policyholders;           -    Requiring  certain  methods  of  accounting;           -    Periodic  examinations  of Independence American's operations and                finances;           -    Prescribing  the  form  and  content  of  records  of  financial                condition  required  to  be  filed;  and           -    Requiring  reserves  for  unearned  premium,  losses  and  other                purposes.       State  insurance  departments  also  conduct  periodic  examinations of the      affairs  of  insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other      reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding      company  issues  and  other  matters.       Recently  adopted  federal  financial services modernization legislation is      expected to lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry      in  the coming years. IAHC's business depends on compliance with applicable      laws  and  regulations  and  its  ability  to  maintain  valid licenses and      approvals  for its operations. Regulatory authorities have broad discretion      to  grant,  renew, or revoke licenses and approvals. Regulatory authorities      may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of      regulations.  In  some  instances,  IAHC  follows  practices  based  on its      interpretations  of  regulations, or those that it believes to be generally      followed  by  the industry, which may be different from the requirements or      interpretations  of  regulatory  authorities.  If  IAHC  does  not have the      requisite  licenses  and  approvals  and  does  not  comply with applicable      regulatory  requirements,  the  insurance  regulatory  authorities  could      preclude  or  temporarily  suspend IAHC from carrying on some or all of its      activities  or  otherwise  penalize  it.  That  type of action could have a      material  adverse  effect on IAHC's business. Also, changes in the level of      regulation  of  the insurance industry (whether federal, state or foreign),      or  changes  in  laws  or  regulations  themselves  or  interpretations  by      regulatory  authorities,  could  have  a  material adverse effect on IAHC's      business.       Certain  Proposed  Federal and State Legislation May, if Adopted, Adversely      Affect  IAHC's  Reinsurance  of  Medical  Stop-Loss.       Individuals  who  obtain  health coverage through self-insured plans cannot      currently  sue  their  employer in state court for punitive or compensatory      damages, but can seek legal recourse in federal court where an employer can      be  ordered  to cover a wrongfully-denied benefit. In the continuing debate      over  health  care  reform,  certain federal and state legislation has been      proposed  which  could  have  the  effect  of  making  plan  sponsors,      administrators,  or  certain  other  parties liable for punitive damages in      state  court. While IAHC cannot predict whether any of these proposals will      be  adopted or what, if any, impact enactment of any of these would have on      its  reinsurance  of  medical  stop-loss,  the number of employers offering      health  benefits  or  choosing  self-insured  plans could be reduced, plans      could  increase  the  portion  paid  by  employees  (thereby  reducing      participation),  pricing  and  coverage  options  could  be  affected,  and      Independence  American  could  be  faced  with greater liability exposures,      although this would be somewhat mitigated since Independence American would      not  be  the  issuing  carrier.                                         -24-       Decreases  in  the Fair Market Value of Fixed Income Securities May Greatly      Reduce  the  Value  of IAHC's Investment Portfolio, and as a Result, IAHC's      Financial  Condition  May  Suffer       At  September  30,  2002,  $5,463,000  of  IAHC's  $11,203,000  investment      portfolio was invested in fixed income securities. The fair market value of      these  fixed  income  securities and the investment income from these fixed      income  securities  fluctuate  depending  on  general  economic  and market      conditions.  With respect to IAHC's investments in fixed income securities,      the fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases      in  an  inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net      investment  income realized by IAHC from future investments in fixed income      securities  will  generally  increase  or  decrease with interest rates. In      addition,  actual  net investment income and/or cash flows from investments      that  carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed      securities,  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as      a  result  of interest rate fluctuations. An investment has prepayment risk      when  there  is  a  risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the      repayment  of  principal  might  occur  earlier than anticipated because of      declining  interest  rates  or  later  than  anticipated  because of rising      interest  rates.  Historically,  the  impact  of  market  fluctuations  has      affected  IAHC's  financial  statements. Because all of IAHC's fixed income      securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the fair market      value  of  IAHC's  securities  are  reflected in IAHC's other comprehensive      income.  Similar  treatment  is  not  available for liabilities. Therefore,      interest  rate  fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect      IAHC's  stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows.       Regulatory  Restrictions  Limit  IAHC's  Ability  to  Obtain Dividends from      Independence  American       One  of  IAHC's  principal  assets  is  the  shares  of  capital  stock  of      Independence  American.  IAHC  may  rely  on  dividends  from  Independence      American  to  meet  its  obligations  for  paying principal and interest on      outstanding  debt  obligations,  dividends  to  stockholders  and corporate      expenses.  The  payment of dividends by Independence American is subject to      regulatory  restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings      of  Independence  American,  as  well  as the regulatory restrictions. As a      result,  should  IAHC's other sources of funds prove to be inadequate, IAHC      may  not  be  able to receive dividends from Independence American at times      and  in  amounts  necessary  to  meet  its  obligations.       IAHC  is  Dependent  on  Key  Personnel       IAHC's  success has been, and will continue to be, dependent on its ability      to retain the services of its existing key executive officers, who are also      executive  officers  of IHC, and to attract and retain additional qualified      personnel  in  the  future.  The  loss  of  the  services of any of its key      executive  officers  or  the  inability  to  hire  and  retain other highly      qualified  personnel in the future could adversely affect IAHC's ability to      conduct  its  business.       New  Laws  and  Regulations  Addressing  Privacy and Electronic Transaction      Issues  Create  Uncertainty  and  Risk  for  Insurers       In  recent  years, the United States Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley      Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. These acts      afford  protection  for  "nonpublic  personal  information"  relating  to      consumers,  and  require  certain  transactions  to  be  conducted  on  an      electronic  basis. Federal regulators have implemented several requirements      of these acts. Additionally, virtually all state legislatures or regulatory      bodies  have  adopted,  or are considering the adoption of, additional laws      and regulations to address privacy and electronic transaction issues. These      new  laws  create  uncertainty  and  risks  for  insurers,  which  need  to      accurately  describe  their  privacy  practices  and  develop  appropriate      procedures  to manage, protect and transmit certain types of customer data.      While IAHC has implemented a process to monitor and achieve compliance with      these  laws,  the  associated costs and potential risks and liabilities are      difficult  or impossible to quantify. IAHC is unable to predict the precise      nature and content of future laws and regulations, or the effects that they      may  have  on  the  business,  operations,  operating  results or financial      condition  of  IAHC.  Potential  areas of exposure facing the industry as a      whole  include  failure  to  accurately  or  adequately  describe  privacy      practices  or to protect customer information from unauthorized disclosure.  THE  COMPANY'S  ACQUISITION OF IAHC MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION  The  acquisition  of  IAHC  may have potential negative effects on the Company's reported results of operations from acquisition-related charges and amortization of  other  intangible  assets.  As a result of the IAHC acquisition, the Company may  record  additional  intangible  assets,  which  may  adversely  affect  the Company's  earnings and profitability for the foreseeable future.  If the amount                                         -25-  of  such  recorded  intangible  assets is increased or if the Company has future losses  and is unable to demonstrate the Company's ability to recover the amount of intangible assets recorded during such time periods, the intangible asset can be  written  down  or  the  period of amortization could be shortened, which may further  increase  annual  amortization  charges.  In  such event, the Company's business  and  financial  condition  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.  IF  THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS INTO THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS, THEN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE  ADVERSELY  AFFECTED  Following its acquisition of IAHC, the Company expects to acquire other managing general  underwriter  businesses.  The  Company  cannot  predict  if or when any prospective  acquisitions  will  occur  or  the  likelihood  that  they  will be completed  on  favorable  terms.  Acquiring  a  business  involves  many  risks, including:       -    Diversion  of  resources  and  management  time;      -    Dilution  to  existing  stockholders  if  the  Company  uses  equity           securities  to  finance  acquisitions;      -    Incurrence  of  unforeseen  obligations  or  liabilities;      -    Inability  of  management  to  maintain  uniform  standards, controls,           procedures  and  policies;      -    Difficulty  assimilating  the  acquired  operations  and  personnel;      -    Risks of entering markets in which the Company has little or no direct           prior  experience;  and      -    Impairment  of  relationships with employees as a result of changes in           management.  The Company cannot assure you that it will make any acquisitions or that it will be  able to obtain additional financing for such acquisitions, if necessary.  If any acquisitions are made, the Company cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully  integrate  the  acquired  business into its operations or that the acquired  business  will  perform  as  expected.  THE  COMPANY'S  EQUITY  INVESTMENTS IN OTHER COMPANIES MAY NOT YIELD ANY RETURNS  Although  the  Company  does  not intend to do so in the future, the Company has made equity investments in Internet-related companies.  In most instances, these investments  are  in  the  form of unregistered securities of private companies. These  companies  typically  are  in  an  early  stage of development and may be expected  to  incur  substantial  losses.  The  Company's  investments  in these companies  may  not  yield any returns.  Furthermore, if these companies are not successful,  the  Company  could  incur  and has incurred charges related to the write-down  or  write-off  of these investments.  For example, the Company wrote down  equity investments by $733,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002.  The Company  also records and continues to record a share of the net losses in these companies, up to its cost basis.  The Company may make additional investments in the  future.  Losses  or charges resulting from these investments could harm the Company's  operating  results.  THE  COMPANY'S  STOCK  PRICE  IS  VOLATILE  The volatility of the Company's stock price may make it difficult for holders of the  common  stock to transfer their shares at the prices they want.  The market price  for the Company's common stock has been volatile in the past, and several factors  could  cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future.  These factors  include:       -    Announcements  of  developments  related  to  the  Company's business;      -    Fluctuations  in  the  Company's  results  of  operations;      -    Sales  of  substantial  amounts  of  the  Company's  securities in the           marketplace;      -    General  conditions  in  the  Company's  industries  or  the worldwide           economy;      -    An  outbreak  of  war  or  hostilities;      -    A shortfall in earnings compared to securities analysts' expectations;      -    Changes  in  analysts'  recommendations  or  projections;  and      -    Changes  in  the Company's relationships with the Company's suppliers.  The  market  price  of the Company's common stock may fluctuate significantly in the  future,  and  these  fluctuations  may  be  unrelated  to  the  Company's performance.  General  market  price declines or market volatility in the future could  adversely  affect  the price of the Company's common stock, and thus, the current  market  price  may  not  be  indicative  of  future  market  prices.                                         -26-  PROSPECTIVE  ANTI-TAKEOVER  PROVISIONS  COULD  NEGATIVELY  IMPACT  THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS  The  Company  is  a  Delaware  corporation. The Delaware General Corporation Law contains  certain provisions that may discourage or delay a change in control of the  Company,  make a change in control of the Company more difficult or prevent the  removal  of  incumbent directors. In addition, the Company's certificate of incorporation  and  bylaws  contain  certain  provisions that have the same or a similar  effect. These provisions may have a negative impact on the price of the Company's  common stock and may discourage third-party bidders from making a bid for the Company or may reduce any premiums paid to stockholders for their common stock.  THE  COMPANY  HAS  A  HISTORY  OF  LOSSES AND MAY FACE UNEXPECTED LIABILITIES IN WINDING  DOWN  THE  BUSINESSES  OF  INTELLICOM,  ISP  CHANNEL  AND  AERZONE  The  Company  has  sustained substantial losses over the last five fiscal years. For  the  year  ended  September  30,  2002,  the  Company  had  a  net  loss of $14,756,000.  At  September  30, 2002, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $405,003,000.  While  the Company expects the process of winding down Intellicom to  be  substantially  completed by December 31, 2002, the Company cannot assure you  that  it  will  be able to do so.  The Company expects to incur significant costs  related  to  terminating contracts, reducing the workforce and recovering and  disposing  of  deployed  assets.  While  the  businesses  of  ISP  Channel, Intellicom,  and  Aerzone  have  been substantially wound down, the Company also cannot  assure  you that all claims and issues have been resolved.  In addition, the  Company  is  currently  involved  in  litigation,  and may in the future be involved  in  additional  litigation,  with respect to the winding down of these former  businesses.  The  Company  cannot  assure you of the outcome of any such litigation.                                         -27-  ITEM  7A.  QUANTITATIVE  AND  QUALITATIVE  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT  MARKET  RISK  INTEREST  RATE  RISK  The  Company's  exposure  to  market  risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily  to  the  increase  or  decrease  in the amount of interest income the Company can earn on its investment portfolio, and on the increase or decrease in the  amount of interest expense the Company must pay with respect to its various outstanding  debt  instruments.  The  risk  associated with fluctuating interest expense  is  limited, however, to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit facilities, which are tied to market rates.  The Company does not use derivative  financial  instruments  or  engage  in  hedging  activities  in  its investment  portfolio.  The  Company  ensures the safety and preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default risks, market risk and reinvestment risk.  The  Company  mitigates default risk by investing in safe and high-credit quality  securities.  The  Company  had  short-term  investments of $40,910,000 at September 30, 2002. Except  for  investments  in  common  and  preferred  stock,  these  short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date  of  purchase  of between three and twenty-three months.  These investments are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.  The Company believes a hypothetical increase in market interest rates  by  10%  from levels at September 30, 2002, would cause the fair value of these short-term investments to fall by an immaterial amount.  Since the Company is not required to sell these investments before maturity, it has the ability to avoid  realizing  losses  on  these investments due to a sudden change in market interest  rates.  On  the  other  hand, declines in the interest rates over time will  reduce  its  interest  income.  Interest rate increases, however, will increase interest expense associated with future  borrowing  by  the  Company, if any.  The Company does not hedge against interest  rate  fluctuations.  CURRENCY  EXCHANGE  RISK  The  Company  has  historically  had  very  low  exposure  to changes in foreign currency  exchange  rates,  and  as  such,  has  not  used  derivative financial instruments  to  manage  foreign  currency  fluctuation  risk.  RECENT  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS  In  April  2002,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued Statement  of  Financial Accounting No. 145 ("SFAS 145"), Rescission of SFAS No. 4,  44,  and  64,  Amendment  of  SFAS  No. 13, and Technical Corrections.  This statement  rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses  from  Extinguishment  of Debt, Statement of Financial Accounting No. 64, Extinguishment  of Debt made to satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements, and Statement of  Financial  Accounting  No.  44,  Accounting  for  Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers.  This  statement also amends Statement of Financial Accounting No. 13, Accounting  for Leases, to eliminate an inconsistency between the accounting for sale-leaseback  transactions  and the accounting for certain lease modifications that  have  economic  effects  that  are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. SFAS  145  is  effective  for fiscal years beginning after, transactions entered into  after  and  financial  statements issued on or subsequent to May 15, 2002. The  adoption  of SFAS 145 had no impact on financial statements of the Company.  In  June  2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting No. 146 ("SFAS 146"),  Accounting  for  Exit  or  Disposal  Activities.  SFAS 146 addresses the recognition,  measurement,  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and  disposal activities, including costs related to terminating a contract that is  not  a  capital  lease  and  termination  benefits  that  employees  who are involuntarily  terminated  receive  under  the  terms  of  a  one-time  benefit arrangement  that  is  not  an  ongoing  benefit  arrangement  or  an individual deferred-compensation  contract.  SFAS 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue  No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and  Other  Costs  to  Exit  an  Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring),  and  requires  liabilities  associated  with  exit and disposal activities  to  be  expensed  as  incurred.  SFAS  146  is effective for exit or disposal  activities  that  we  initiate  after  December  31,  2002.                                         -28-  ITEM  8.
