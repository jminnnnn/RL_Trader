Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations  The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements of the Company and the related Notes thereto  appearing  elsewhere in Form 10-K.  The Company's  fiscal year ends on  September  30th of each year.  "Fiscal  1998" refers to the twelve months ended  September  30, 1998 with  comparable  references  for other twelve month periods ending  September 30th. This discussion  contains  forward-looking statements that involve risks and  uncertainties.  The Company's  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those discussed in "Risk  Factors,"  "Business"  and  elsewhere  in this  Form  10-K.  The  Company disclaims any obligation to update information  contained in any forward-looking statement.   Overview  During  fiscal 1998,  the Company  resolved to become,  through its wholly owned subsidiary,  ISP Channel,  Inc.  (formerly known as MediaCity World, Inc.) ("ISP Channel"),  the dominant cable-based provider of high-speed Internet access, and other Internet  related  services to homes and businesses in the franchise areas of those cable systems unaffiliated with the six largest US cable operators.  As part of this new focus, on November 22, 1998 the Company announced its agreement to acquire  Intelligent  Communications  Inc.  ("Intellicom"),  the former Xerox Skyway  Network.  The Company  believes that this  acquisition  will give it the ability,  using satellite,  to bypass telephone  companies and thus dramatically reduce the cost of bringing  high-speed  Internet  service to customers of small and  mid-sized  cable  systems.  Also in line with this  strategy of becoming an Internet  access  provider,  the  Company  determined  to  divest  its two other businesses:   Micrographic   Technology  Corporation  ("MTC"),  a  wholly  owned subsidiary offering document management  solutions,  and Kansas  Communications, Inc.  ("KCI"),  a wholly  owned  subsidiary  that sells and  services  telephone systems,  third party  computer  hardware and  application  oriented  peripheral products such as voice mail and video conferencing  systems. The Company entered into  letters  of  intent  for the sale of MTC and KCI on  November  5, 1998 and November  9,  1998,   respectively.   Since  July  27,  1998,  the  Company  has reclassified  and reported KCI as a  discontinued  operation.  However,  at this time,  pending  shareholder  approval  of the  sale of both  MTC and KCI  (which together,  comprise  substantially  all of the  Company's  assets),  the Company continues to classify and report MTC as a continuing business. It is the current intent of the  Company to  conclude  the sale of both KCI and MTC during  fiscal 1999.  ISP Channel and Intellicom  The Company began providing  Internet services  following its acquisition of ISP Channel  in June  1996.  While  the  Company  seeks to  maintain  and build the traditional  dial-up  Internet access business  acquired at, and built up since, that time, the Company's primary objective is to become the dominant provider of high-speed  Internet access via the existing cable television  infrastructure to homes and businesses in the franchise areas of those cable systems  unaffiliated with the six largest US cable operators.  The Company  commenced  marketing this high-speed service,  using cable modems, to select cable operators and potential subscribers in March 1998.  However,  the Company  believes that, as a result of its limited  financial  resources,  the Company  has not fully  implemented  its marketing  strategies,  and this business has, to date,  generated  only nominal revenues.  The Company has signed a  definitive  agreement  to acquire  Intellicom  and the acquisition is currently pending  regulatory  approvals.  The Company expects to complete the acquisition  during the second quarter of fiscal 1999.  Through use of its proprietary  satellite  system,  Intellicom  currently  provides  two-way Internet  connectivity  to local Internet  service  providers  ("ISPs"),  school systems  and   businesses,   primarily   located  in  remote  and  rural  areas. Intellicom's VSAT (very small aperture  terminals)  network allows  connectivity throughout  the 48 lower states as well as in southern  Canada and south Alaska. Intellicom  offers a wide range of Internet  services  based on its  proprietary T1Plus product that presently offers up to 2 Mbps data transfer rates. It is the Company's  intention that, while Intellicom will continue to market its services to its traditional  customer sectors,  it will also provide ISP Channel with the in-house  ability to bypass many of the high cost  terrestrial  telephone  links that ISP Channel has  historically  used to connect the cable  head-ends  of its affiliated cable operators to the network operating center of ISP Channel.  ISP Channel  Affiliates.  As of December 31, 1998, the Company had contracts for its ISP Channel service with 28 cable  operators,  including  Galaxy,  Palo Alto Cable  Co-op  and Coral  Springs  Cable,  representing  119  cable  systems  and approximately 1.4 million homes passed. Nineteen of these systems,  representing approximately  216,000 homes passed,  have been equipped and have begun offering the Company's services, in most cases during the past three months. In addition,    the  Company  has  non-binding  letters  of  intent  with ten  cable  operators, including 39 systems,  representing  approximately  359,000 homes passed.  As of December 31, 1998, the Company had approximately  1,250 residential and business subscribers to its ISP Channel service. See "Risk  Factors--Dependence  on Local Cable Operators and their Cable  Infrastructure"  and "--Dependence on Exclusive Access to Cable Subscribers Need for Aggressive Implementation and Deployment."  In order to expand its cable-based  Internet subscriber base significantly,  the Company  expects  to  aggressively  pursue  affiliation  agreements  with  cable operators which will provide it with the exclusive  right to market  cable-based Internet  services  to  existing  cable  television  subscribers  in such  cable operators' systems. The Company anticipates that this policy of rapid deployment will result in substantial capital  expenditures,  operating losses and negative cash flow in the near term.  While the Company  believes  that it currently  has sufficient cash and financing sources  available to fund its operations  through 1999,  there can be no  assurance,  however,  that the  Company  will be able to access  additional  capital to finance  its  strategy  in the longer  term or to implement  its  strategy or achieve  positive  cash flow or  profitability  in a timely fashion, or at all.  ISP Channel Revenue  Sources.  In providing its Internet  services,  the Company receives  revenue from the provision of (i) cable  modem-based  Internet  access services and (ii) traditional dial-up Internet access services.  Currently,  the Company or, in certain cases, its local cable affiliate,  typically  charges new cable modem-based  Internet access subscribers a one-time connection fee of $99, which includes modem installation but excludes any required  modification of the existing cable television  connection,  which is usually  performed by the local cable affiliate. Thereafter, each subscriber pays a monthly access fee, which is currently as low as $39 per month.  It is the  Company's  expectation  that such rates will decrease over time. The Company  anticipates  that it will purchase a majority  of the cable  modems used by  subscribers,  who will then be charged a nominal  lease  fee.  The  Company  does not charge new  dial-up  subscribers  a connection fee, but does charge a monthly access fee of approximately $20.  In addition to connection  fees and monthly access fees, the Company  intends to pursue additional revenue  opportunities from Internet  advertising,  e-commerce and Internet-based  telephony.  The Company also intends to pursue long distance telephone  services and  telephony  debit and credit  cards.  Intellicom is also anticipated to generate continuing revenue from the sale of VSAT service.  In the future, as digital set-top boxes become available and are introduced into the Company's  affiliated  cable  systems,  the Company  expects to charge those subscribers  monthly access fees  comparable to those now charged to traditional dial-up  subscribers.  The Company  also  expects to charge  customers a set-top connection fee to help defray installation expenses.  For cable-based  Internet services,  the Company typically shares 25% of monthly access  revenues with cable  affiliates  for the first 200  subscribers  in each system and 50% thereafter. For other services, such as Internet-based telephony, e-commerce and advertising,  the Company expects to share between 25% and 50% of these revenues with the cable affiliates.  The Company expects that all revenues from cable modem lease  income will be  retained by the  Company.  Depending  on competitive  market  conditions,  these pricing and revenue  sharing  parameters could change over time.  Cost of Services.  Costs to the Company include  installation costs, network and cable operation costs and personnel and other costs.  Commissions  paid to cable affiliates vary by type of connectivity and size of contract.  Installation  costs are  expected  to vary by type of  connectivity  and type of customer. The Company charges new subscribers a one time fee to defray the costs of  installation,  which  includes  labor  and  overhead.  While  currently  the installation  fee does not cover the entire cost  incurred by the  Company,  the Company expects over time that  installation  costs will decline as cable modems become more standardized and are eventually bundled as standard equipment in new personal computers.  Other  network  costs  include  the  cost of  connection  to the  public  switch telephone  network.  Such  connections  are required,  among other  reasons,  to service the Company's  dial-up customers as well as to provide those cable modem customers located on a one-way cable system,  the return path (or upstream link) to the  Company's  equipment  located  at the cable  operator's  system  hub (or headend).  In  addition,  the  Company  incurs  costs  associated  with  leasing telecommunications  capacity  such as fiber where such  capacity is used,  among other things,  to link the Company's  equipment at the cable system headend back to the Company's  network  operating  center in Mountain View,  California.  The Company anticipates that the utilization of Intellicom's network as a substitute for third party terrestrial  links will provide  significant cost savings to the    Company as it grows.  There are two major cost  benefits to the Company in using Intellicom's  VSAT capacity to supplement or replace its current  landline-based communications  infrastructure.  First,  for  downstream  Internet  traffic,  it enables the Company to  simultaneously  broadcast data from one single source to its  entire  network  of  headend-based  receivers  which  produces  significant efficiency  improvements over comparable landline systems.  Second, for upstream traffic,  it permits the Company to allocate the necessary  capacity required by each headend in smaller  increments (and consequently  lower cost) than would be available using terrestrial links, such as T1 lines.  Sales, Marketing and Operating Expenses. Sales, marketing and operating expenses include the costs of the Company's cable affiliate  program,  maintenance of its infrastructure,  customer care, content and new business development in addition to sales and marketing expenses.  Capital Expenditures.  In order to pursue its business plan, the Company expects to incur  significant  capital  expenditures to provide its turnkey solution for cable operators,  principally  relating to the installation of headend equipment and the purchase of customer premise equipment such as cable modems. The cost of headend equipment (including  installation) has averaged $45,000 per headend for the 19 systems through which the Company currently provides service.  The retail costs of cable  modems,  currently  approximately  $179 to $349,  is expected to decline over time as economies of scale in production and new market entrants in the cable modem market push down prices.  However,  the Company recognizes that, in line with experience in other subscription  service industries,  it will need to subsidize for the customer both the cost of installation  and the cable modem equipment. Such expenditures,  however, are expected to be offset in part by the savings  resulting  from  decreased  costs of  installation  and prices for such equipment  as  equipment  is  standardized   and  production   volumes  increase respectively.  MTC. Through MTC, the Company develops and manufactures sophisticated, automated electronic  document  management and film-based  imaging solutions for customers with large-scale,  complex,  document-intensive requirements. MTC's hardware and software products are based on an industry standard client-server  architecture, providing  flexibility to connect to a wide variety of  information  systems and produce output to various storage media,  including optical disk,  magnetic disk and tape,  CD-ROM,  and microfilm and  microfiche,  spanning the entire document lifecycle.  MTC's electronic and film-based  imaging hardware systems  typically range in price between $200,000 and $1,000,000,  and may represent a significant capital commitment by MTC's customers, leading to a lengthy sales cycle of up to 24 months. Accordingly, MTC's operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period.  The Company has signed a letter of intent to sell MTC. Either through the currently contemplated transaction or otherwise, the Company expects to dispose of this business during fiscal 1999       Historical Results of Operation  The Company  has changed  significantly  over the last  several  years as it has entered certain  businesses and exited or prepared to exit others. In July 1998, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a plan to discontinue operations of the telecommunications   business.   Accordingly,   the  operating  results  of  the telecommunications  business have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line item on the  consolidated  statements of operations. The assets and liabilities of such operations have been reflected as a net asset in the consolidated balance sheets.  The  Company is in the process of  negotiating  the sale of both the MTC and KCI operations and expects that these sales will be completed  within a twelve month period.  Management does not anticipate a loss on these sales and intends to use sale proceeds to reduce outstanding  indebtedness and provide additional working capital to ISP Channel.  Until such time as the Company's  shareholders  approve the disposition of these businesses,  the Company will treat the MTC business as part of its continuing operations.  The  discussion  of  the  Company's  consolidated  results  of  operation  below therefore treats the telecommunication  business as a discontinued operation. In addition,  the  Company  entered  the  Internet  business  in June 1996 with the purchase of the Internet services  business and only began offering  cable-based Internet   services  in  the  fourth   quarter  of  fiscal  1997.   Accordingly, year-to-year comparisons may not be meaningful.                                              1998           1997          1996                                          ---------      ---------     ---------                                                      (in thousands)           Sales              MTC                          $ 13,042        $20,330       $19,417              ISP Channel                     1,018          1,008           167            Cost of Sales              MTC                             9,410         11,050        11,375              ISP Channel                     1,218            885             -            Gross Profit              MTC                             3,632          9,280         8,042              ISP Channel                      (200)           123           167            Operating Expenses              MTC                             9,272          8,714         8,162              ISP Channel                     8,016          1,273           478            Income (loss) from               continuing operations              MTC                            (5,640)           566          (120)              ISP Channel                    (8,216)        (1,150)         (311)              Corporate Overhead             (1,977)        (1,204)       (2,281)                                          ---------      ---------     ---------                Consolidated               $(15,833)      $ (1,788)     $ (2,712)                                          ---------      ---------     ---------  Fiscal 1998 compared to Fiscal 1997  Consolidated sales decreased $7.3 million, or 34.0%, to $14.1 million for fiscal 1998, as compared to $21.4 million for fiscal 1997. The decrease in consolidated sales was the result of a decrease in the sales  associated  with the operations of MTC.  Sales in this  business  decreased  $7.3  million,  or 35.8%,  to $13.0 million for fiscal 1998,  as compared to sales of $20.3 million for fiscal 1997. The decrease in MTC's sales was primarily  the result of a significant  decrease in the domestic  sales of the  business's  core product  line:  computer  output microfiche  ("COM")  equipment.  Domestic orders for MTC's  microfiche  systems, which  typically  range in price from $200,000 to $1 million,  were delayed by a purchasing  slowdown  brought  about  by  a  trend  of  corporate  consolidation occurring within the business's major markets,  including such industries as the document  management  service  bureau  industry  and the banking  and  insurance industries.  Sales were  further  affected by the fact that MTC entered the year with an order backlog of $1.4  million,  as compared to an order backlog of $3.4 million in the prior period.  MTC believes that this trend is reversing and that the demand for its  products  will return at least to their  historical  levels. Sales in the Company's Internet service business increased $10,000,  or 1.0%, to $1.0  million for fiscal  1998,  as compared to fiscal  1997.  Net sales for the business's ISP Channel service  increased  $289,000 to $309,000 for fiscal 1998, as  compared  to  $20,000  for fiscal  year 1997.  ISP  Channel  introduced  its cable-based  services  to the  market in the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  1997. Traditional dial-up and dedicated Internet service sales increased $42,000, or    7.0%, to $644,000 for fiscal 1998, as compared to $602,000 for fiscal 1997. This business also experienced a decrease in miscellaneous and one-time service sales of $321,000,  or 83.2% to $65,000 for fiscal  1998,  as compared to $386,000 for fiscal 1997. This decrease in  miscellaneous  and one-time  service sales is the result  of  the  Company's  decision  to  re-focus  its  sales  efforts  on  its cable-based ISP Channel services.  Consolidated gross profit decreased $6.0 million,  or 63.5%, to $3.4 million for fiscal 1998,  as compared to $9.4 million for fiscal 1997,  with profit  margins decreasing to 24.4% from 44.1% for the  comparable  period in 1997. The decrease in gross profit is primarily  the result of a decrease in gross  profits of $5.6 million  associated  with the  operations of MTC.  Gross profit  margins in this business decreased to 27.9% in fiscal 1998, from 45.6% for the comparable period in 1997.  This  decrease in profit  margin is a direct result of the decrease in MTC's COM  equipment  sales,  which have  historically  contributed  the highest product profit margins for this business. Gross profit decreased $323,000 in the Internet  service  business for fiscal 1998. ISP Channel  experienced a negative gross  profit  of  $200,000  in  fiscal  1998,  primarily  as the  result of the build-out of the segment's  Internet  operations used to support its cable-based service offering.  In addition,  on a system by system deployment basis, the ISP Channel  cable-based  service  offering  initially  results in a negative  gross profit, until such time as subscriber sales exceed the up-front, recurring fixed telephony and Internet connection fees.  Operating expenses (selling, engineering,  general and administrative) increased $7.1  million,  or 91.6%,  to $14.9 million for fiscal 1998, as compared to $7.8 million for fiscal 1997.  Operating  expenses  associated with the operations of MTC decreased  approximately $400,000, or 7.1%, to $5.3 million for fiscal 1998, as compared to $5.7 million for fiscal 1997.  Operating expenses associated with ISP Channel and  corporate  overhead  increased a combined  $7.5  million,  with expenses associated with ISP Channel increasing $6.7 million to $7.6 million for fiscal 1998, as compared to $860,000 for fiscal 1997. This increase in operating expense is primarily the result of the increase in ISP Channel's administrative, sales and  marketing  efforts  supporting  the ISP Channel  cable-based  service offering.  Similarly,  the  increase in the  corporate  operating  expenses  are directly related to the management changes and financing  activities  associated with the  Company's  strategic  refocusing  towards the ISP Channel  cable-based service offering.  Amortization expense associated with goodwill remained constant in fiscal 1998.  In fiscal 1998, the Company recorded an impairment loss on the long-lived assets of the document management business.  Estimates based upon certain trends in the document  management  business indicated that the undiscounted future cash flows from this  business  would be less  than the  carrying  value of the  long-lived assets related to this business.  Accordingly,  the Company  recognized an asset impairment  loss of $3.1  million,  all of which was reduced  from the  carrying value of goodwill.  For fiscal 1998, the Company had a net loss from continuing  operations of $15.8 million,  as compared to a net loss from  continuing  operations of $1.8 million for fiscal 1997.  Interest expense increased  $271,000,  or 23.7%, to $1.4 million for fiscal 1998 from $1.1 million for fiscal 1997,  primarily as a result of fluctuations in the Company's outstanding  indebtedness with respect to its revolving line of credit and the issuance of its 5% convertible subordinated debentures.   The Company made no  provisions  for income taxes for fiscal 1998 and 1997, as a result of the Company's net operating loss carry-forward.  The Company  recognized a loss from operations with respect to its  discontinued telecommunications  business of $73,000 for fiscal  1998,  as compared to a gain from operations of $739,000 for the same period in 1997.  The Company  paid  aggregate  dividends  of $343,000  during  fiscal 1998 on its outstanding 5% Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock.  For fiscal 1998, the Company had a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $17.3 million, as compared to a net loss of $2.6 million for fiscal 1997.       Fiscal 1997 compared to Fiscal 1996  Consolidated sales increased $1.7 million,  or 8.9%, to $21.3 million for fiscal 1997,  as  compared  to $19.6  million for fiscal  1996.  MTC's sales  increased $913,000, or 4.7%, to $20.3 million for fiscal 1997 as compared to $19.4 million for  fiscal  1996.  This  increase  in MTC's  sales is  primarily  the result of increased monthly rental revenues  associated with its continued  implementation of alternative customer leasing arrangements for its core COM products. Sales in the Internet  services  business  increased  $841,000 to $1.0 million for fiscal 1997 from $167,000 for fiscal 1996. Sales in the Internet  services business for fiscal 1996 consist only of fourth quarter  sales,  as the business was acquired in June 1996.  Consolidated gross profit increased $1.2 million,  or 14.6%, to $9.4 million for fiscal 1997,  as compared to $8.2 million for fiscal 1996,  with profit  margins increasing  to 44.1%  from  41.9%  for the same  period  in 1996.  Gross  profit increased  $1.3 million,  or 15.4%,  in MTC to $9.3 million for fiscal 1997 from $8.0 million for fiscal 1996, with gross profit margins increasing to 45.7% from 41.4% for the same  period in 1996.  The  increase  in gross  profit  margin was primarily the result of increased productivity efficiencies in the manufacturing operation, which resulted from a strong equipment backlog and a steady, customer order driven,  manufacturing  schedule.  The Internet services business recorded gross profits of $123,000 for fiscal 1997,  however year to year comparisons are not meaningful,  given the fact that the business  operated for only one quarter in fiscal  1996 and  allocated  no expense to cost of goods sold during this one quarter period.  Operating expenses (selling, engineering,  general and administrative) decreased $24,000 to $9.9  million for fiscal 1997 as compared to $9.9  million for fiscal 1996.  General and  administrative  expenses  associated  with MTC and corporate overhead  decreased a combined  $810,000,  or 20.2%,  to $3.2 million for fiscal 1997,  as compared to $4.0  million in the same period in 1996.  The decrease in these  combined  general  and  administrative  expenses is the result of certain overhead cost cutting measures  implemented to achieve back office  efficiencies throughout the Company.  For MTC,  engineering  expenses increased $324,000,  or 19.1%,  to $2.0 million for fiscal 1997,  as compared to $1.7 million for fiscal 1996, as a result of the business's  continued  effort to expand and improve the products  offered  to its  customers.  Included  in the  consolidated  operating expenses  are two  separate,  one-time  charges  associated  with changes in the Company's product lines, in the amounts of $2.1 million for fiscal 1997 and $2.2 million for fiscal 1996.  Operating  expenses in the Internet  services business increased $483,000 to $858,000 for fiscal 1997, however year to year comparisons are not  meaningful  given  the fact  that the  business  operated  for only one quarter in fiscal 1996.  Amortization  expense increased  $294,000,  or 29.6%, to $1.3 million for fiscal 1997 from  $993,000 for fiscal 1996.  This increase in  amortization  expense is primarily the result of the additional  amortization expense associated with the acquisition of the Internet services business in June 1996.  The Company had a net loss from continuing operations of $1.8 million for fiscal 1997, as compared to a net loss from  continuing  operations of $2.7 million for fiscal 1996.  Consolidated  interest expense decreased  $75,000,  or 6.1%, to $1.1 million for fiscal 1997 as compared to $1.2 million for fiscal  1996,  primarily as a result of the conversion of $4.5 million of convertible  subordinated  notes since June 1996.  The  Company  recognized  a gain on the sale of  securities  of $5.7  million in fiscal  1996.  This  gain  was the  result  of the sale of all  shares  of IMNET Systems, Inc. ("IMNET") held by the Company.  The Company made no provisions  for income taxes for fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996 as a result of the Company's net operating loss carry-forward.  The Company  recognized a gain from operations with respect to its  discontinued telecommunications  business of $739,000 for fiscal 1997,  as compared to a loss of $1.8  million for the same period in 1996.  The loss  incurred in fiscal 1996 includes a loss from operations of $2.5 million  associated with the disposal of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Communicate Direct, Inc.  The Company  recognized  a loss from  extraordinary  item of $486,000 for fiscal 1997, as compared to a loss from extraordinary item of $6.1 million for the same period in 1996.  The losses are  associated  with the disposal of the  Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Communicate Direct, Inc.  For fiscal 1997, the Company had a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $2.6 million, as compared to a net loss of $6.1 million for fiscal 1996.     Liquidity and Capital Resources  Over the past year,  the Company's  growth has been funded through a combination of private equity, bank debt and lease financings.  As of December 31, 1998, the Company had  approximately  $3.5 million of unrestricted  cash. In addition,  on January  12,  1999,   the  Company   executed  an  agreement  with  a  group  of institutional  investors  whereby the Company  issued $12 million in convertible subordinated  loan notes.  These notes bear an interest  rate of 9% per year and mature in 2001.  In  connection  with these notes,  the Company  issued to these investors  an  aggregate  of 300,000  warrants.  These  warrants,  which have an exercise price of $17 per warrant, expire in 2003. The Company has also received a commitment to provide,  subject to final  documentation,  a secured $3 million loan from a financial lender and is in negotiations with a vendor with regard to a $6 million  equipment  lease line.  The Company  believes that, as a result of this, it currently has  sufficient  cash and financing  commitments  to meet its funding  requirements over the next year.  However,  the Company has experienced and continues to experience  negative  operating  margins and negative cash flow from operations,  as well as an ongoing  requirement for substantial  additional capital  investment.  The Company expects that it will need to raise substantial additional  capital to accomplish its business plan over the next several years. The Company's  future cash  requirements  for its business plan  expansion  will depend on a number  of  factors  including  (i) the  number  of cable  affiliate contracts, (ii) cable modem and associated costs of equipment, (iii) the rate at which subscribers  purchase the Company's Internet service offering and (iv) the level of marketing  required to acquire and retain  subscribers  and to attain a competitive  position in the marketplace.  In addition,  the Company may wish to selectively pursue possible acquisitions of businesses, technologies, content or products  complementary to those of the Company in the future in order to expand its Internet presence and achieve operating efficiencies. The Company expects to seek to obtain  additional  funding  through the sale of public or private  debt and/or equity securities or through a bank credit facility.  The Company expects it may raise as much as $150  million in debt  and/or  equity  financing  during fiscal 1999.  If additional  funds are raised  through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of the stockholders of the Company will be reduced,  stockholders  may experience  additional  dilution and such  securities may have rights,  preferences or privileges  senior to those of the Company's common stock.  There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing might be available.  For  fiscal  1998,  cash  flows  used  in  operating  activities  of  continuing operations  were $4.7 million,  as compared to $1.4 million for fiscal 1997. The Company used $5.6  million in  investing  activities  of  continuing  operations during fiscal 1998, as compared to $1.1 million used by investing  activities of continuing operations in fiscal 1997. Cash flow provided by financing activities of  continuing  operations  increased  $20.4 million to $23.4 million for fiscal 1998, as compared  $3.0 million for fiscal 1997.  This increase in cash flow was primarily the result of the issuance of the Company's 5% Redeemable  Convertible Preferred Stock.  On December  31,  1997,  the Company sold 5,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock and  warrants to purchase  150,000  shares of common stock for $5 million. The $4.6  million in net proceeds  from this sale were applied to the  Company's Revolving  Credit  Facility.  On May 28, 1998, the Company sold 10,000 shares of its Series B Preferred  Stock and warrants to purchase  200,000 shares of common stock for $10 million and on August 31,  1998,  the Company sold 7,500 shares of its Series C Preferred  Stock and warrants to purchase  93,750  shares of common stock for $7.5  million.  The proceeds of these last two sales were added to the working  capital of the  Company.  The Company has  extended the maturity of its Revolving  Credit  Facility,  which has a  maximum  borrowing  capacity  of $9.5 million, through January 15, 2000.  On November 5, 1998, the Company entered into a letter of intent to sell MTC for $5.125  million and on November 9, 1998,  the Company  entered  into a letter of intent to sell KCI for $6.6  million.  In both cases,  deposits of $100,000 were paid to the  Company on  execution  of the letters of intent and, in the case of the sale of MTC, such deposit is non-refundable.  Subject to the approval of the Company's  shareholders,  the Company anticipates that both sales will be closed in the second  quarter  of fiscal  1999 but there can be no  assurance  that the transactions will close in this time frame, or at all.  The purchase price for MTC is  anticipated  to be $5.125 million  (including the $100,000 non-refundable  deposit). The balance of $5.025 million will be paid at closing in readily available funds.  The  purchase  price for KCI is  anticipated  to be $6  million  (including  the $100,000  deposit)  and the  issuance to the Company of 60,000  shares of common    stock of the purchaser, Convergent Communications,  Inc. At closing, the Company expects to receive $3.4 million in readily  available  funds and two 12-month 8% notes for an aggregate amount of $2.5 million.  The  proceeds  from the  sale of MTC and KCI  will be used in part to repay  the Company's bank credit facility with West Suburban Bank. As of December 31, 1998, there was $4.8  million  outstanding  under this  facility.  The  balance of the proceeds will be used to pay for transaction costs associated with the sales and to increase the Company's cash position. There can be no assurance however, that both or either of the transactions will close on the terms described, or at all.  In aggregate,  the sale of both MTC and KCI  represents a substantial  change in the business of the Company and, as such, requires shareholder  approval.  While KCI has been treated as a discontinued  operation since July 27, 1998, and while management  of the Company  intends to dispose of MTC, the Company has continued to treat MTC as a continuing  business pending such shareholder  approval of its sale.  Set out below,  however,  are unaudited  selected  financial data for the Company  which  reflect  the  effect on the  Company  had MTC been  treated as a discontinued operation.

The  transaction   will  close  upon  Federal   Communications Commission  approval of the  transfer of  Intellicom's  licenses to the Company. Such  approval is expected to occur in the second  quarter of fiscal  1999.  The agreed  purchase  price  comprises (i) a cash  component of $500,000  payable at closing,  (ii) a promissory  note in the amount of $1 million due one year after closing (and payable in cash or in the  Company's  common stock at the option of the sellers),  (iii) a promissory note in the amount of $2 million due two years after  closing  (and  payable in cash or in the  Company's  common  stock at the option of the  Company),  (iv) the issuance of 500,000  shares of the  Company's common stock (adjustable upwards after one year in certain  circumstances),  and (v) a demonstration  bonus of $1 million payable on the first anniversary of the closing,  if  certain  milestones  are met,  in cash or shares of the  Company's common stock at the option of the Company.      Year 2000 Issues  Many  computer  programs  have been written using two digits rather than four to define the  applicable  year.  This  poses a problem  at the end of the  century because such computer  programs would not properly  recognize a year that begins with "20" instead of "19".  This, in turn, could result in major system failures or  miscalculations,  and is  generally  referred to as the "Year 2000 Issue" or "Y2K  Issue".  We have  formulated  a Y2K Plan to address our Y2K issues and has created a Y2K Task Force  headed by the  Director  of I/S and Data  Services  to implement the plan. Our Y2K Plan has six phases:  1)   Organizational  Awareness -  educate  our  employees,   senior  management,      and the board of directors  about the Y2K issue. 2)   Inventory  - complete  inventory  of  internal  business  systems and their      relative  priority to continuing  business  operations.  In addition,  this      phase  includes a complete  inventory of critical  vendors,  suppliers  and      services providers and their Y2K compliance status. 3)   Assessment - assessment of internal  business systems and critical vendors,      suppliers and service providers and their Y2K compliance status. 4)   Planning - preparing  the  individual  project  plans and project teams and      other  required  internal and external  resources to implement the required      solutions for Y2K compliance. 5)  Execution -  implementation  of the  solutions  and fixes. 6)  Validation - testing the solutions for Y2K compliance.  Our Y2K Plan will apply to two areas:  o         internal business systems o         compliance by external customers and providers  Internal Business Systems  Our internal  business systems and workstation  business  applications will be a primary  area  of  focus.  We are in  the  unique  position  of  completing  the implementation  of new  enterprise-wide  business  solutions to replace existing manual processes and/or "home grown"  applications  during 1999. These solutions are  represented  by their  vendors as being fully Y2K compliant We have few, if any, "legacy" applications that will need to be evaluated for Y2K compliance.  We plan to have completed the Inventory and Assessment  Phases of  substantially all critical  internal  business  systems by January 31, 1999, with the Planning Phase to be completed by March 31, 1999.  The  Execution and  Validation  Phases will be  completed  by August 31,  1999.  We expect to be Y2K  compliant  on all critical systems, which rely on the calendar year before December 31, 1999.  Some  non-critical  systems  may not be  addressed  until  after  January  2000. However,  we believe such systems will not cause significant  disruptions in our operations.  Compliance by External Customers and Providers  We are in the process of the  inventory  and  assessment  phases of our critical suppliers,  service  providers and  contractors to determine the extent to which our interface  systems are susceptible to those third parties' failure to remedy their own Y2K issues. We expect that assessment will be complete by May 1999. To the extent that  responses to Y2K  readiness  are  unsatisfactory,  we intend to change   suppliers,   service  providers  or  contractors  to  those  that  have demonstrated Y2K readiness; but can not be assured that we will be successful in finding such alternative suppliers, service providers and contractors. We do not currently have any formal information concerning the status of our customers but have  received  indications  that  most  of our  customers  are  working  on Y2K compliance.  Risks Associated with Y2K  We believe  the major risk  associated  with the Y2K Issue is the ability of our key business partners and vendors to resolve their own Y2K Issues. We will spend a great  deal of time  over  the  next  several  months,  working  closely  with suppliers and vendors, to assure their compliance.  Should a  situation  occur  where a key  partner  or vendor is unable to resolve their Y2K issue,  we will be in a position to change to Y2K  compliant  partners and vendors.  Cost to Address Y2K Issues  Since we are in the unique  position  implementing  new enterprise wide business solutions   to  replace   existing   manual   processes   and/or   "home  grown" applications.,  there will be little,  if any, Y2K changes  required to existing business applications.  All of the new business applications  implemented (or in the  process  of  being  implemented  in 1999)  are  represented  as  being  Y2K compliant.  We  currently  believe that  implementing  our Y2K Plan will not have a material effect on our financial position.  Contingency Plan  We have not  formulated  a  contingency  plan at this  time but  expect  to have specific contingency plans in place prior to September 30, 1999.  Summary  We anticipate that the Y2K Issue will not have a material  adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however, that the systems of other companies or government entities, on which we rely for supplies,  cash payments, and future business, will be timely converted, or that a failure to convert by another company or government entities, would not have a material adverse effect on our financial  position or results of operations.  If third party service providers and vendors, due to Y2K Issues, fail to provide us with  components,  materials,  or services  which are  necessary  to deliver our services  and  product   offerings,   with  sufficient   electrical   power  and transportation  infrastructure  to deliver our services  and product  offerings, then any such  failure  could have a material  adverse  effect on our ability to conduct business, as well as our financial position and results of operations.  Interest Rate Risk  The  Company's  exposure to market risk for  changes in interest  rates  relates primarily  to the  increase or  decrease  in the amount of  interest  income the Company can earn on its investment  portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest  expense the Company must pay with respect to its various outstanding  debt  instruments.  The risk associated with  fluctuating  interest expense is limited,  however,  to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit  facilities  which are tied to market rates. The Company does not use derivative  financial  instruments  in its  investment  portfolio.  The  Company ensures the safety and preservation of its invested  principal funds by limiting default risks,  market risk and reinvestment risk. The Company mitigates default risk by investing in safe and high-credit quality securities.     Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
