ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996       Since December 31, 1996, the gross investment in rental property has increased from $598 million to $936 million as of December 31, 1997 due to the acquisition of the following properties (the "Acquisition Properties"):  (i) California Hawaiian on March 14, 1997;  (ii) Golf Vista Estates on March 27, 1997; (iii) Golden Terrace South on May 30, 1997; (iv) a portfolio of eighteen manufactured home communities and two commercial properties (collectively, the "MPW Properties") on August 29, 1997; (v) Arrowhead Village on September 16, 1997, and (vi) seventeen of the Ellenburg Communities on December 18, 1997. The total number of sites owned and controlled has increased from 27,356 as of December 31, 1996 to 44,108 as of December 31, 1997.       The following table summarizes certain weighted average occupancy statistics for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996.  "Core Portfolio" represents an analysis of properties owned during both periods of comparison.                                       Core Portfolio     Total Portfolio                                   ---------------    ----------------                                    1997     1996      1997      1996                                   ------   ------    ------    ------                 Total sites                  25,631   25,554    29,323    26,621      Occupied sites               24,319   24,098    27,770    25,025      Occupancy %                   94.9%    94.3%     94.7%     94.0%      Monthly base rent per site     $325     $312      $327      $310         Base rental income ($109 million) increased $15.9 million or 17.0%.  For the Core Portfolio, base rental income increased approximately $4.7 million or 5.2%, reflecting a 4.3% increase in base rental rates and a 0.9% increase related to occupancy.  The remaining $11.2 million increase in base rental income was attributed to the Acquisition Properties.       Monthly base rent per site for the total portfolio increased 5.5%, reflecting a 4.2% increase in monthly base rent per site for the Core Portfolio and higher monthly base rents for the Acquisition Properties.  Average monthly base rent per site for the Acquisition Properties was $343 for the year ended December 31, 1997.       Weighted average occupancy increased 0.7% due to increased occupancy at the expansion communities and the addition of the Acquisition Properties with higher occupancy percentages to the portfolio.                                         16       17        Utility and other income ($11.8 million) increased $3.0 million or 33.6%, primarily due to an increase of $1.2 million attributed to the Acquisition Properties, the collection of dividend income of $173,000 in the first quarter of 1997, and increased utility income, real estate tax pass-ons and other miscellaneous income at the Core Portfolio.       Interest income ($1.9 million) decreased $479,000 or 19.8%, primarily due to the repayment of $13 million of notes receivable in August 1997, partially offset by an increase in interest earned on short-term investments.  Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996 of approximately $4.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 5.4% per annum in both years.       Property operating and maintenance expenses ($32.3 million) increased $3.9 million or 13.9% due to the impact of the Acquisition Properties and an increase in property payroll, property general and administrative expenses and insurance and other expenses at the Core Portfolio.  Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense and utility expense at the Core Portfolio.  Property operating and maintenance expenses represented 26.2% of total revenues in 1997 and 27.0% in 1996.       Real estate taxes ($8.4 million) increased $405,000 or 5.1% due to the impact of the Acquisiton Properties, partially offset by a decrease in the Core Portfolio due to lower than expected assessed values at certain of the properties based on actual bills received. Real estate taxes represented 6.8% of total revenues in 1997 and 7.6% in 1996.       Property management expenses ($5.1 million) increased $741,000 or 17.1%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in management company payroll and incremental costs associated with self management of the Acquisition Properties.  Property management expenses represented 4.1% of total revenues in both 1997 and 1996.       General and Administrative expenses ("G&A") ($4.6 million) increased $497,000 or 12.2%.  The increase was primarily due to increased payroll resulting from salary increases.  G&A represented 3.7% of total revenues in 1997 and 3.9% in 1996.       Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") increased $12.7 million or 21%.  Approximately $7.6 million of the increase related to the Acquisition Properties.  The remaining increase reflected increased base rental income and decreased repairs and maintenance expense, utility expense and real estate tax expense, partially offset by increased payroll expense, property general and administrative expense and insurance and other expenses at the Core Portfolio.  In addition, corporate G&A and property management expenses increased.  EBITDA represented 59.2% of total revenues in 1997 and 57.5% in 1996.       Interest and related amortization ($21.8 million) increased $4.0 million or 22.3%.  The increase was due to higher weighted average outstanding debt balances during the period.  The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 30, 1997 and 1996 were $301.3 million and $234.9 million, respectively.  The effective interest rate was 7.1% in 1997 and 7.2% in 1996.  Interest and related amortization represented 17.6% of total revenues in 1997 and 16.9% in 1996.       On December 12, 1997 the Company refinanced the $100.0 million mortgage note (the "Original Mortgage Debt") with a $265.0 million mortgage note (the "New Mortgage Debt") collateralized by 29 properties beneficially owned by MHC Financing Limited Partnership.  The New Mortgage Debt has a maturity date of January 2, 2028 and pays interest only at 7.015%.  There is no principal amortization until February 1, 2008 after which principal and interest are paid from available cash flow and the interest rate is reset at a rate equal to the then 10-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.0%.  In October 1996, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "1997 Swap") fixing LIBOR on the Original Mortgage Debt  at 5.57% effective January 10, 1997 through March 3, 1998.  The Company sold the 1997 Swap in December 31, 1997 for approximately $26,000 in connection with the refinancing.       On March 1, 1997, the Company amended the credit agreement for its $100.0 million line of credit reducing the interest rate from LIBOR plus 1.375% to LIBOR plus 1.125%.  In addition, the fee on the average unused amount was reduced to 0.125% of such amount from 0.15%.  The Company did not pay any fees in connection with this amendment.       On April 3, 1997, the Company entered into a $60.0 million term loan (the "Loan") with a group of banks with interest only payable monthly at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%.  The Loan matures on April 3, 2000 and may be extended to April 3, 2002.  In connection with the Loan, the outstanding balance under the $100.0 million line of credit was reduced by $60.0 million.                                         17    18        In July 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at 6.4% for the period March, 1998 through 2003.  By fixing the rate on $100 million of debt, the Company avoids the general uncertainty relating to the floating interest rate on the Company's variable rate debt through such time. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only of legal costs which were deemed immaterial.  The value of the 1998 Swap is impacted by changes in the market rate of interest.  Had the 1998 Swap been entered into on December 31, 1997, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have been 5.97%.  Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap rate for the 1998 Swap increases or decreases the value of the 1998 Swap entered into by the Company versus its current value by approximately $43,245.       Depreciation on corporate assets ($590,000) increased $102,000 or 20.9% due to fixed asset additions in 1996 associated with the Company's conversion to a new accounting software system.  Depreciation on corporate assets represented 0.5% of total revenues in both 1997 and 1996.       Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs ($17.4 million) increased $2.1 million or 13.9% as a result of the Acquisition Properties.  In addition, the Company recognized a one-time gain of $18,000 representing gains on the prepayment of notes receivable and the sale of certain assets related to the Chateau Communities, Inc. ("Chateau") merger attempt, partially offset by the write-off of certain deferred compensation.  Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs  represented 14.1% of total revenues in 1997 and  14.5% in 1996.       In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company recognized an extraordinary item for early extinguishment of the Original Mortgage Debt of $556,000.       COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995       Since December 31, 1995, the gross investment in rental property had increased from $543 million to $598 million when compared to December 31, 1996 due to the acquisition of Waterford on February 28, 1996, the funding of the Candlelight Village loan, which was accounted for as a purchase, on May 9, 1996, and the acquisition of Casa del Sol Resort No. 1 and Casa del Sol Resort No. 2 (collectively, the "Casa del Sol Resorts") on October 23, 1996.  The total number of sites increased from 25,552 as of December 31, 1995 to 27,356 as of December 31, 1996.       The following table summarizes certain weighted average occupancy statistics for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995.                                         Core Portfolio    Total Portfolio                                   ---------------    ----------------                                    1996     1995      1996      1995                                   ------   ------    ------    ------                 Total sites                  25,554   25,375    26,621    25,375      Occupied sites               24,098   23,787    25,025    23,787      Occupancy %                   94.3%    93.7%     94.0%     93.7%      Monthly base rent per site     $312     $297      $310      $297         Base rental income ($93.1 million) increased $7.9 million or 9.2%.  For the Core Portfolio, base rental income increased approximately $5.4 million or 6.3%, reflecting a 5.0% increase in base rental rates and a 1.3% increase related to occupancy.  Base rental income at Waterford, Candlelight Village and the Casa del Sol Resorts (collectively, the "1996 Acquisitions") was approximately $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  Partially offsetting this increase was a $502,000 decrease in base rental income resulting from the sale of two properties in 1995.       Monthly base rent per site for the total portfolio increased 4.4% reflecting a 5.0% increase in the Core Portfolio, partially offset by lower monthly base rents for the 1996 Acquisitions.  Average monthly base rent per site for the 1996 Acquisitions was $270.       Weighted average occupancy increased 0.4% primarily due to increased occupancy at the expansion communities.       Utility and other income ($8.8 million) increased $340,000 or 4% primarily due to increased utility income and real estate tax pass-on income.                                         18    19        Interest income ($2.4 million) increased $124,000 or 5%, primarily due to interest earned on the employee notes granted on January 2, 1996, partially offset by a decrease in interest earned on short-term investments.  Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 of approximately $3.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 5.4% in both years.       Property operating and maintenance expenses ($28.4 million) increased $1.3 million or 5% due to the impact of the 1996 Acquisitions, an increase in utility expense, insurance and other expenses, and repairs and maintenance expense at the Core Portfolio.  Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease resulting from the sale of two properties in 1995 and a decrease in property payroll and property general and administrative expense at the Core Portfolio. Property operating and maintenance expenses represented 27.0% of total revenues in 1996 and 27.9% in 1995.       Real estate taxes ($7.9 million) increased $706,000 or 10% due to the expected increase in assessed values at certain Properties in 1996.  Real estate taxes represented 7.6% of total revenues in 1996 and 7.5% in 1995.       Property management expenses ($4.3 million) decreased $337,000 or 7%.  The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in management company payroll as a result of the staffing reductions in 1995.  Property management expenses represented 4.1% of total revenues in 1996 and 4.8% in 1995.       G&A expenses ($4.0 million) decreased $475,000 or 11%.  The Company continued to focus on reducing G&A expenses as a percentage of revenues and, as a result these costs decreased significantly in 1996.  In addition, professional fees decreased resulting from the write-off in 1995 of legal due diligence and related costs associated with acquisitions which did not materialize.  G&A expenses represented 3.9% of total revenues in 1996 and 4.7% in 1995.       EBITDA increased $7.1 million or 21%.  Approximately $2.2 million of the increase related to the 1996 Acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease resulting from the sale of two properties in 1995.  The remaining increase reflected increased base rental income and decreased payroll expense and property general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased repairs and maintenance expense, utility expense, insurance and other expenses and real estate expense at the Core Portfolio.  In addition, corporate G&A increased and property management expenses decreased.  EBITDA represented 57.5% of total revenues in 1996 and 55.1% in 1995.       Interest expense and related amortization ($17.8 million) decreased by $745,000 or 4%.  Interest expense decreased $13,000 due to a decrease in the interest rate on the Original Mortgage Debt resulting from the interest rate swap agreement entered into in December 1995 (see discussion below), partially offset by an increase in interest on the line of credit resulting from additional borrowings in 1996.  The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 were $234.9 million and $228.4 million, respectively.  The effective interest rates were 7.2% and 7.6% for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Amortization decreased $732,000 due to the write-off in 1995 of approximately $385,000 of loan costs related to the $50 million line of credit with General Electric Credit Corp. which expired in March 1995.  In addition, the Company sold a portion of the interest rate cap on the Original Mortgage Debt related to 1996 which decreased amortization in 1996.  Interest expense and related amortization represented 16.9% of total revenues in 1996 and 19.1% in 1995.       The Company had an interest rate cap for the term of the Original Mortgage Debt which eliminated exposure to increases in LIBOR over 6%, plus 1.05%.  In connection with the 1997 Swap and 1998 Swap, the Company sold portions of the interest rate cap related to 1996 and 1997 and recorded a non-cash write-off of approximately $650,000 in the fourth quarter of 1995 and $482,000 in the fourth quarter of 1996.       Depreciation expense and other costs ($15.7 million) increased $390,000 or 2% as a result of the 1996 Acquisitions.  In addition, the Company sold a portion of the interest rate cap on the Original Mortgage Debt related to 1996 and 1997 and incurred non-cash charges of $482,000 and $650,000 in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Depreciation expense represented 14.5% of total revenues in 1996 and 15.6% in 1995.                                        19     20   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Net cash provided by operating activities increased $4.9 million from $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 to $54.6 million for the same period in 1997.  This increase reflected an $8.6 million increase in FFO, which reflected increases in rental income and decreases of certain expenses as discussed in "Results of Operations" above, and an increase in collection of rents received in advance and security deposits related to the property acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and rents receivable and decreased accounts payable accruals.       Net cash provided by operating activities increased $9.5 million from $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1995 to $49.7 million for the same period in 1996.  This increase reflected a $7.7 million increase in FFO, which reflected increases in rental income and decreases of certain expenses as discussed in "Results of Operations" above, an increase in accounts payable accruals of approximately $1.6 million primarily related to acquisition activities and real estate taxes, and an increase in collection of rents receivable of $498,000, partially offset by decreased collections of miscellaneous receivables.       FFO was defined by NAREIT in March 1995 as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ["GAAP"]), before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of propery, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for significant non-recurring items, if any.  In the first quarter of 1996, the Company adopted this new definition of FFO which was effective for periods ending after December 31, 1995.  Prior to this adoption, FFO was defined as income before allocation to minority interests plus certain non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization.  The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.  Funds available for distribution ("FAD") is defined as FFO less non-revenue producing capital expenditures.  The Company believes that FFO and FAD are useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, they provide investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures.  FFO and FAD in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.       The following table presents a calculation of FFO and FAD for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 (amounts in the thousands):                                                         For the Years Ended                                                          December 31,                                                   -------------------------          Computation of funds from operations:      1997     1996     1995                                                   -------  -------  -------                     Income before allocation to               minority interests and                 extraordinary item...............  $33,469  $26,943  $20,023                   Depreciation on real estate                       assets and other costs.....   17,365   15,244   15,773                   Gain on sale of assets........      ---      ---   (1,278)                                                   -------  -------  -------            Funds from operations (a)............  $50,834  $42,187  $34,518                                                   =======  =======  =======          Computation of funds available           for distribution:            Funds from operations (a)............  $50,834  $42,187  $34,518                   Non-revenue producing                      improvements - rental                        properties................

Net cash used in investing activities increased $65.4 million from $4.4 million provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1995 to $61.0 million used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996, primarily due to the acquisitions of Waterford and the Casa del Sol Resorts, the financing of Candlelight Village, the costs incurred in pursuit of a proposed merger, a decrease in cash from the sale of rental properties in 1996 when compared to 1995 and the purchase of short-term investments. Partially offsetting this increase were increased distributions from RSI.       During 1996, the Company offered a merger proposal to Chateau in opposition to Chateau's proposed merger with ROC Communities, Inc. ("ROC") and incurred approximately $1.3 million in project related costs and invested in certain project related saleable assets with a book value of approximately $9.9 million.  These expenditures were included in prepaid expenses and other assets at December 31, 1996.  On February 11, 1997, Chateau's shareholders approved Chateau's merger with ROC.  Thus, during 1997, the Company sold the related assets it had acquired for approximately $11.1 million and incurred a net gain of approximately $259,000.       During 1997, notes receivable of approximately $15 million were repaid. In connection with the repayments, the Company recognized a one-time gain of $525,000 representing the collection of a $1.4 million prepayment penalty, partially offset by the write-off of the apportioned purchase price originally allocated to the management contract for the property collateralizing one note and write-off of the unamortized discount on another note.       On March 14, 1997, the Company acquired California Hawaiian, located in San Jose, California, for a purchase price of approximately $23.3 million.  The acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.       On March 27, 1997, the Company acquired Golf Vista, located in Monee, Illinois.  The purchase price of approximately $7.4 million, including deferred payments of $150,000 per year for the next five years, was funded with existing available cash.       On May 30, 1997, the Company entered into a capital lease with East Tincup Village, Inc., a Colorado corporation, for Golden Terrace South (formerly known as East Tincup Village). The lease term is 110 months commencing on May 29, 1997 with monthly rental payments of approximately $18,000.  The lease contains an option for the Company to purchase Golden Terrace South at the termination of the lease for $2.4 million.  For financial accounting purposes, the Company accounts for the lease as a direct financing lease and, accordingly, the Company has recorded an investment in real estate and a note payable.       On August 29, 1997, the Company acquired the MPW Properties from limited partnerships and joint ventures affiliated with MPW.  The aggregate purchase price of the MPW Properties was approximately $103 million.  Approximately $64 million of the purchase price was in the form of units of limited partnership interest ("OP Units"), approximately $6 million was in the form of installment notes payable, approximately $17 million was in the form of cash funded from a borrowing under the Company's line of credit, and the Company assumed debt of approximately $13 million.  In addition, the Company capitalized approximately $1.8 million of costs associated with the acquisition.       On September 16, 1997, the Company acquired Arrowhead Village, located in Lantana, Florida for a purchase price of approximately $20.3 million.  The acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.                                         21      22        On September 4, 1997, the Company entered into a portfolio purchase agreement to acquire 38 manufactured home communities (the "Ellenburg Communities") from partnerships having Ellenburg Capital Corporation ("ECC") as the general partner for a purchase in excess of $300 million.  The agreement immediately transferred property management of the 38 communities to the Company.  The Ellenburg Communities are being sold pursuant to an order of the Superior Court for the State of California (the "California Court") which is overseeing the involuntary dissolution of ECC.  The California Court has appointed winding-up agents to liquidate and wind-up the affairs of ECC.  In December 1997, the Company entered into a supplemental agreement (the "Supplemental Agreement") in furtherance of its acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities which was approved by the California Court.  Sales of the Ellenburg Communities are subject to limited partner approval.  In December 1997, the Company closed on the acquisition of seventeen of the Ellenburg Communities for approximately $143 million and gained effective control of an additional twelve communities.  In 1998, the Company closed on the acquisition of two additional Ellenburg Communities and made acquisition advances to the partnerships which own seven of the Ellenburg Communities.  The Company has also acquired certain other undivided minority interests in certain of the properties.  The Company is in the process of obtaining limited partner approval to acquire the remaining Ellenburg Communities.  The Company has 120 days to complete certain post-closing due diligence procedures and adjust the purchase price to the extent that:  (i) the net operating income of the communities is less than the amount used to determine the purchase price; (ii) the community requires environmental, structural engineering, deferred maintenance and other physical or legal costs which may be in excess of anticipated amounts for such items, and (iii) the community has negative working capital.  The maximum amount for such adjustments will be equal to 25% of the net equity value of the community which will be held in escrow for 120 days from closing.  The acquisitions are being financed through assumption of debt securitization with a bank and through borrowings under the Company's line of credit.       Capital expenditures for improvements were approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  Of the $6.4 million, approximately $4.2 million represented improvements to existing sites.  The Company anticipates spending approximately $4.5 million on improvements to existing sites during 1998.  The Company believes these improvements are necessary in order to increase and/or maintain occupancy levels and maximize rental rates charged to new and renewing residents.  The remaining $2.2 million represented costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's Properties and other corporate headquarter costs.  The Company is currently developing 90 additional sites at Golf Vista Estates which should be available for occupancy in 1998.       Net cash provided by financing activities increased $174.6 million from $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 to $185.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 primarily due to the addition of the New Mortgage Debt whereby the Company borrowed an additional $165 million, increased borrowings on the line of credit, and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the purchase of 330,300 shares of the Company's common stock under the common stock repurchase plan, increased distributions to common stockholders and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the Debt Refinancing.       Net cash provided by financing activities increased $56.6 million from $45.7 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1995 to $10.9 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily due to $52.1 million of borrowings under the line of credit for the acquisitions of Waterford and the Casa del Sol Resorts and the financing of Candlelight Village.       Distributions to common stockholders and minority interests increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 when compared to the same period in 1996 due to an increase in the distribution per share and number of shares and OP units outstanding.  For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company declared and paid quarterly distributions totaling $1.32 per share. For the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company declared and paid quarterly distributions totaling $1.22 per share, which included the fourth quarter distribution paid on January 10, 1997.  Return of capital on a GAAP basis was $0.15, $0.24 and $0.44 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.       Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease matures.  Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.                                          22    23        The year 2000 issue ("Year 2000") is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year.  Any of the Company's computer programs that have time-sensitive software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.  This could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations, including, among other things, a temporary inability to process transactions, collect rents, or engage in similar normal business activities. Based on a recent assessment, the Company determined that a majority of its applications will function properly with respect to dates in the year 2000 and thereafter.  The Company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the Company's interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties' failure to remediate their own year 2000 issues.  The Company's total Year 2000 project cost and estimates to complete do not include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third party Year 2000 issues.  There can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the Company's systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the Company's systems.  The Company anticipates completing its Year 2000 project no later than December 31, 1998, which is prior to any impact on its operating systems. The total cost of the Year 2000 project is estimated to be immaterial assuming third parties remediate their own year 2000 issues.  This assumption is based on management's best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events, and there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.       The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing line of credit.  The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to working capital.
