ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which reflect management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of future events on the Company's financial performance; the adverse impact of external factors such as inflation and consumer confidence; and the risks associated with real estate ownership.   PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND DISPOSITIONS       The following chart lists the Properties acquired and sold since January 1, 2002:      PROPERTY                                       TRANSACTION DATE            SITES   --------                                       ----------------            -----      TOTAL SITES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002........................................... 50,663  ACQUISITIONS:   Mt.

In 2003, occupancy in our Core Portfolio decreased 1.9%. Also during 2003, average monthly base rental rates for the Core Portfolio increased approximately 5.1%. We project continued growth during 2004 in our Core Portfolio performance. Core Portfolio base rental-rate growth is expected to be approximately 4%. These projections would result in growth of approximately 2.5% in Core Portfolio income from operations (also referred to as net operating income or "NOI").   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES       Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.       We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.       Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We use a 30-year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life. However, the useful lives, salvage value, and customary depreciation method used for land improvements and other significant assets may significantly and materially overstate the depreciation of the underlying assets and therefore understate the net income of the Company. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") is currently reviewing the methods of depreciation and cost capitalization for all industries and in June 2001 issued FASB Exposure Draft, "Accounting in Interim and Annual Financial Statements for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant and Equipment", the implementation of which, if issued, could also have a material effect on the Company's results of operations.       The valuation of financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments" ("SFAS No. 107") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Where possible, we base the fair values of our financial instruments, including our derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, we base our estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instrument.       Certain costs, primarily legal costs, relative to our efforts to effectively change the use and operations of several Properties subject to rent control (see Note 17) are currently classified in other assets. These costs, to the extent these efforts are successful, are capitalized to the extent of the established value of the revised project and included in the net investment in real estate for the appropriate Properties (see Note 5). To the extent these efforts are not successful, these costs will be expensed. In addition, we capitalize certain costs, primarily legal costs, related to entering into lease agreements which govern the terms under which we may enter into leases with individual tenants and which are expensed over the term of the lease agreement. In 2003, due to the successful settlement of litigation related to one Property, DeAnza Santa Cruz, we reclassified approximately $5.3 million of these costs to land improvements and will depreciate these costs over 30 years       In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). The objective of FIN 46 is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity ("VIE") and determine when the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and results of operations of a VIE need to be included in the company's consolidated financial statements. A company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate such entity if the company absorbs a majority of the VIE's expected losses or receive a majority of the entity's expected residual returns if they occur, or both.                                         23       The provisions of FIN 46 apply to the Company upon initial involvement with the respective entity for transactions created after January 31, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 in 2003 had no effect on the Company in 2003. The provisions of FIN 46 and related revised interpretations apply no later than the end of the first interim reporting period ending March 15, 2004 (March 31, 2004) for entities created before February 1, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating and assessing the impact of FIN 46 and the related revised interpretations on entities created before February 1, 2003.        CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES       Prior to January 1, 2003 we accounted for our stock compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", based upon the intrinsic value method. This method results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Common Shares on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, we elected to account for our stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", which will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock options and other equity awards issued. SFAS 148 provides three possible transition methods for changing to the fair value method. We have elected to use the modified-prospective method. This method requires that we recognize stock-based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value method had been used to account for all employee awards granted, or settled, in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method was applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period presented (amounts in thousands, except per share data):                                             2003        2002        2001                                         -------     -------     -------        Net income available for Common  Shares as reported .................   $27,014     $36,445     $32,083 Add: Stock-based compensation  expense included in net income as  reported ...........................     2,139       2,185       2,549 Deduct: Stock-based compensation  expense determined under the fair  value based method for all awards ..

The total number of sites owned or controlled increased from 50,663 as of December 31, 2001 to 51,715 as of December 31, 2003.

Property Operating Revenues       The 3.2% increase in Community base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a 5.1% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 1.9% decrease in average occupied sites. The increase in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility income, which resulted from higher expenses for these items.  Property Operating Expenses       The 3.7% increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in insurance and other expenses, utility expense, repair and maintenance expense, administrative expense and payroll expense. The 5.8% increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes is generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues, increased by 1.5% due to increases in payroll costs and computer expenses.                                         25  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 (CONTINUED)  Home Sales Operations       The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Home Sales Operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

The average selling price of new homes remained steady year over year. Used home sales gross profit reflects a decrease in gross margin on used home sales, partially offset by an increase in volume. Brokered resale revenues reflects increased resale volumes. The 4.0% decrease in home selling expenses primarily reflects reductions in advertising expenses.  Other Income and Expenses       In October, 2003, we received approximately $501 million from the Recap. The cash received from the Recap was used to pay down our Line of Credit and pay off our Term Loan, with the remainder placed in short-term investments to be used for payment of a special distribution in January, 2004 and for future acquisitions. As a result, interest income increased reflecting additional interest earned on short-term investments with an average balance of $273 million. The increase in other corporate income reflects increased income from unconsolidated joint ventures. The decrease in general and administrative expense is due to decreased professional fees and public company costs, partially offset by increased payroll costs and banking expenses. Interest and related amortization increased due to the Recap and the payment of approximately $3 million to unwind the 2001 Swap, partially offset by decreased interest rates during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $800 million and $731.8 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 6.4% and 6.8% per annum for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.                                         26  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)       COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001       Since December 31, 2000, the gross investment in real estate increased from $1,218 million to $1,296 million as of December 31, 2002, due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period. The total number of sites owned or controlled increased from 51,304 as of December 31, 2000 to 51,582 as of December 31, 2002.

Property Operating Revenues       The 4.1% increase in Community base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a 5.3% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 1.2% decrease in average occupied sites. The decrease in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to decreases in utility income, which resulted from lower expenses for these items.  Property Operating Expenses       The increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in property payroll, insurance and other expenses, repair and maintenance and administrative expenses, partially offset by decreased utility expense. The increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes is generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues, increased by 3.8% due to increases in payroll costs and office expenses.                                         27  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  Home Sales Operations       The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Home Sales Operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

As a result of the acquisition of RSI (see Note 7), the Company owns and controls RSI and consolidates the financial results of RSI with those of the Company. The pro forma presentation of detailed 2001 amounts is for comparison purposes and has no effect on previously reported net income. For the year ended December 31, 2001, equity in income of affiliates was approximately $1.8 million and included the $2.3 million of income from home sales operations presented above as well as $539,000 of interest income, $15,000 of corporate expenses and $1.0 million of interest expense.       New home sales gross profit reflects a 13.4% decrease in sales volume coupled with a 1.1% decrease in the gross margin. The average selling price of new homes increased $6,000 or 8.7% compared to 2001. Used home sales gross profit reflects a decrease in both volume and gross margin on used home sales. Brokered resale revenues reflects decreased resale volumes. The 6.9% decrease in home selling expenses primarily reflects reductions in payroll and advertising expenses.   Other Income and Expenses       The increase in interest income reflects a decrease in notes receivable offset by an increase in chattel notes receivable acquired through the acquisition of RSI. The decrease in other corporate income primarily reflects decreased income from unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in general and administrative expense is due to increases in costs related to operating a public company, increased payroll costs and increased consulting and legal costs. Interest and related amortization decreased due to lower interest rates during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $731.8 million and $713.2 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 6.8% and 7.0% per annum for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.                                         28  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY       As of December 31, 2003, we had $325.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $110.0 million available on our Line of Credit. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions, generally through our working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the Line of Credit. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under our Line of Credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to working capital.   INFLATION       Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize our risks of inflation.   FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS       Funds From Operations ("FFO"), a non-GAAP financial performance measure, was redefined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") in April 2002, as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs' computations. The Company believes that FFO is useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, FFO provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.       The following table presents a calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (amounts in thousands):                                                                    2003            2002          2001                                                               --------       --------       --------        COMPUTATION OF FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS:   Net income available for Common Shares ...................  $ 27,014       $ 36,445       $ 32,083   Income allocated to Common OP Units ......................     6,474          8,926          8,209   Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs .......    38,034         35,552         34,228   Depreciation expense included in discontinued operations..       135            484            605   Gain on sale of Properties and other .....................

Also during 2001, we finalized a settlement agreement whereby we received $10.8 million in proceeds related to the sale of a Property in Indiana.       During the year ended December 31, 2002, we acquired the eleven Properties listed in the table below. The acquisitions were funded with borrowings on our Line of Credit and the assumption of $47.9 million of mortgage debt, which includes a $3.0 million mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we purchased adjacent land and land improvements for several Properties for approximately $559,000.

The acquisitions were funded with monies held in short-term investments. The acquisitions included the assumption of liabilities of approximately $650,000. Also during 2003, we acquired a parcel of land adjacent to one of our Properties for approximately $97,000.

The Venture included 18 Properties with 3,581 sites. The results of operations of the College Heights Joint Venture prior to restructuring were included with the results of the Company due to the Company's voting equity interest and control over the Venture. Pursuant to the restructuring, the Company sold its general partnership interest, sold all of the Company's voting equity interest and reduced the Company's total investment in the College Heights Joint Venture. As consideration for the sale, the Company retained sole ownership of Down Yonder, a 361 site community in Clearwater, Florida, received cash of approximately $5.2 million and retained preferred limited partnership interests of approximately $10.3 million, recorded net of a $2.4 million reserve. The continuing preferred limited partnership interests are accounted for using the equity method and reported as an investment in a joint venture.   ACQUISITION OF REALTY SYSTEMS, INC.       On January 1, 2002, the Company purchased all of the common stock of Realty Systems, Inc. ("RSI"). The Company previously owned the non-voting preferred stock of RSI and had notes receivable from RSI which were recorded as an investment in affiliate. The Company purchased the common stock of RSI from Equity Group Investments, Inc., controlled by Samuel Zell, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, for approximately $675,000. As a result of this acquisition, the Company owns and controls RSI and consolidates the financial results of RSI with those of the Company including $839,000 of cash from the acquisition on January 1, 2002.   CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS       Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as recurring capital expenditures ("Recurring CapEx"), site development costs and corporate costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $11.9 million and $13.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Of these expenditures, the Company believes that approximately $8.0 million or $155 per site for 2003 and $7.6 million or $147 per site for 2002 are non-revenue producing improvements which are necessary in order to increase and/or maintain occupancy levels and maintain competitive market rents for new and renewing residents. Site development costs were approximately $9.0 million and $10.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's Properties and costs for improvements to sites when a smaller used home is replaced with a larger new home.   EQUITY TRANSACTIONS       In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute 90% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) to its stockholders. The following distributions have been declared and/or paid to common stockholders and minority interests since January 1, 2001.

We used proceeds from the $501 million borrowing in October, 2003 to pay the special distribution on January 16, 2004. The special cash dividend will be reflected on stockholders' 2004 1099-DIV to be issued in January 2005.                                         31  EQUITY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)       The Operating Partnership paid distributions of 9.0% per annum on the $125 million of Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units ("Preferred Units"). Distributions on the Preferred Units were paid annually on the last calendar day of each quarter beginning December 31, 1999. The Company expects to continue to make regular annual distributions and has set its 2004 distribution to common stockholders at $0.05 per share per annum.   MORTGAGES AND CREDIT FACILITIES       On October 17, 2003, we closed 49 mortgage loans collateralized by 51 Properties (the "Recap") providing total proceeds of approximately $501 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.84% and with a weighted average maturity of approximately 9 years. Approximately $170 million of the proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding on the Company's Line of Credit and Term Loan. Approximately $225 million was used to pay a special dividend of $8.00 per share on January 16, 2004. The remaining funds are being held in short-term investments and will be used primarily for investments in 2004.       We have an unsecured Line of Credit with a group of banks (the "Line of Credit") with a total facility of $110 million, bearing interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.65% that matures on August 9, 2006. We pay a quarterly fee on the average unused amount of the total facility equal to 0.15% of such amount. In October, 2003, all amounts outstanding on the Line of Credit were repaid with proceeds from the Recap. As of December 31, 2003, $110 million was available under the Line of Credit. The Line of Credit had a total facility of $150 million prior to amendment in December, 2003.       We had a $100 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of banks with interest only payable monthly at LIBOR plus 1.375%. In October, 2003, we paid off the Term Loan with proceeds from the Recap.       On October 29, 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "2001 Swap"), effectively fixing LIBOR on $100 million of our floating rate debt at approximately 3.7% per annum for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of the 2001 Swap required monthly settlements on the same dates interest payments were due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the 2001 Swap was reflected at market value. In October, 2003, we unwound the 2001 Swap at a cost of approximately $3 million, which is included in interest and related amortization in 2003 in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.       On April 17, 2003, we entered into an agreement to refinance and increase the Bay Indies Mortgage from approximately $21.9 million to $45 million. Under the new agreement, the Bay Indies Mortgage bears interest at 5.69% per annum, amortizes over 25 years and matures April 17, 2013. The net proceeds were used to pay down the Company's Line of Credit in April, 2003. Also during the year ended December 31, 2003, mortgage notes payable on four other Properties were repaid totaling approximately $23.5 million using proceeds from borrowings on the Company's Line of Credit.       During the year ended December 31, 2002, as part of the purchase of RSI, in a non-cash transaction, we assumed a $12.5 million note payable ("Conseco Financing Note"), collateralized by manufactured home inventory. The Conseco Financing Note was repaid at a discount during 2002 using proceeds from our Line of Credit. In addition, we repaid a maturing mortgage note in the amount of $1.1 million and $2.1 million of other unsecured notes payable using proceeds from our Line of Credit.       During the year ended December 31, 2001, we repaid three maturing mortgages in the aggregate amount of $12.1 million using proceeds from our Line of Credit. In addition, we entered into a $50.0 million mortgage note (the "Stagecoach Mortgage") collateralized by 7 Properties beneficially owned by MHC Stagecoach, L.L.C. The Stagecoach Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 6.98% per annum, amortizes beginning September 1, 2001 over 10 years and matures August 31, 2011. Proceeds from the financing were used to reduce borrowings on the Line of Credit by $37.9 million.       Certain of our mortgage and credit agreements contain covenants and restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured debt versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed charges-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), limitations on certain holdings and other restrictions.                                         32  MORTGAGES AND CREDIT FACILITIES (CONTINUED)       As of December 31, 2003, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below (dollars in thousands).

In addition, the Company leases land under non-cancelable operating leases at certain of the Properties expiring in various years from 2022 to 2031 with terms which require twelve equal payments per year plus additional rents calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, ground lease rent was approximately $1.6 million per year. Minimum future rental payments under the ground leases are approximately $1.6 million for each of the next five years and approximately $26.3 million thereafter.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS       Since December 31, 2003, we invested in 30 Properties as listed in the table below.

(b)  Property was purchased from Spring Gulch, Inc. (c)  Property was purchased from PRVR Limited Partnership. (d)  Property was purchased from Twin Lakes Land, LLC and Twin Lakes Camping      Resort, LLC. (e)  Property was purchased from Don-Bar Family Limited Partnership. (f)  The portfolio was acquired for a total purchase price of $62 million and      $20.4 million of net equity. The transaction was funded partially through      loans obtained on the individual properties as shown in the table. (g)  On February 3, 2004, the Company invested approximately $29.7 million in      preferred equity in six entities controlled by Diversified Investments,      Inc. ("Diversified"). In addition, the Company has invested approximately      $1.4 million in the Diversified entities managing these properties. (h)  The Company invested approximately $1.4 million with Diversified in four      separate entities, each controlling a Property.       In addition, on February 17, 2004, we tendered payment of $69 million cash to acquire a 93% equity interest in entities that own and operate 28 vacation resort properties, containing 11,357 sites. Twenty of the properties are located in Florida, six in Texas, and two in California. The acquisition was funded with monies held in short-term investments and $50 million drawn from the Company's line of credit.       Beginning in 1996, a series of partnerships were formed between "NHC" entities and "PAMI" entities. The PAMI entities have sued for specific performance in Chancery Court in Delaware seeking to acquire the NHC entities' interests. The NHC entities have filed a counter-suit, and have asked the judge to schedule a hearing to address the matter within thirty days. Under the terms and conditions of the partnership agreements, $69 million was paid to acquire the PAMI entities' interests. Principals of the NHC entities will continue to operate the properties and maintain an equity position in the new entity. The existing dispute is related to the PAMI entities' desire to liquidate their investments. While the possibility of additional litigation and its attendant risks remain, we believe that providing liquidity to the NHC entities to acquire the PAMI interests may assist in resolving the dispute.  ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF MARKET RISK       Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates, since a portion of our outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on LIBOR. Our Line of Credit ($110 million outstanding at December 31, 2003) bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.65%, per annum. If LIBOR increased/decreased by 1.0% during the year ended December 31, 2003, interest expense would have increased/decreased by approximately $1.3 million based on the average balance outstanding under the Company's Line of Credit during the period.       On October 29, 2001, we entered into the 2001 Swap, effectively fixing the LIBOR rate on $100 million of our floating rate debt at approximately 3.7% per annum for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of the 2001 Swap required monthly settlements on the same dates interest payments were due on the debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we unwound the 2001 Swap for a cost of approximately $3 million. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") and its amendments, SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the interest rate swap was reflected at market value. We believed the 2001 Swap was a perfectly effective cash flow hedge, under SFAS No. 133, and there would be no effect on net income as a result of the mark-to-market adjustment. Mark-to-market changes in the value of the 2001 Swap prior to its payoff were included in other comprehensive income.   ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
