The 4.3% increase in base rental income for the Total Portfolio reflects a 3.8% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 0.5% increase in average occupied sites and also reflects acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties. The increase in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in pass through items such as utilities and real estate taxes - which resulted from higher expenses for these items. The decrease in Total Portfolio utility and other income is due primarily to the sale of Mesa Regal RV resort and other changes in the Non-Core Properties. Also included in other income is a gain on the sale of the FFEC-Six water and wastewater treatment company of $719,000, partially offset by an impairment loss on the DeAnza Santa Cruz water and wastewater service company of $701,000.       The decrease in interest income is primarily due to the repayment of certain notes receivable and fewer short-term investments. Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 of approximately $1.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 6.0% and 6.3% per annum, respectively.  Operating Expenses       The increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility expenses generally passed through and included in utility income. Expenses for the Core Portfolio also reflect increases in repairs and maintenance expense, payroll and property general and administrative expenses partially offset by decreased insurance and other expenses. Core Portfolio real estate taxes increased 2.4% generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. The increase in Total Portfolio property operating and maintenance expense and real estate taxes is also impacted by acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property revenues, increased 6.1%.       General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased payroll resulting from salary increases and increased public company related expenses.       Interest and related amortization decreased due to lower weighted average outstanding debt balances during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $707.5 million and $738.1 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.4% and 7.2% per annum for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.       Depreciation on corporate assets increased due to fixed asset additions related to information and communication systems. Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs decreased due primarily to the acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties.                                         21    22 COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998       Since December 31, 1997, the gross investment in real estate increased from $936 million to $1,264 million as of December 31, 1999 due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period. The total number of sites owned or controlled has increased from 44,108 as of December 31, 1997 to 54,007 as of December 31, 1999.       The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Core Portfolio and the Total Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.

(2)  Site and occupancy information does not include the five Properties owned      through joint ventures or the four RV properties.                                         22    23 Revenues       The 3.8% increase in base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a 3.7% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 0.2% increase in average occupied sites. The 9.9% increase in base rental income for the Total Portfolio reflects a 3.2% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 6.5% increase in average occupied sites and also reflects acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties. The increase in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in pass through items such as utilities and real estate taxes - which resulted from higher expenses for these items. The increase in Total Portfolio utility and other income is due primarily to RV income related to the purchase of three RV resorts during 1998 and other changes in the Non-Core Properties.       The decrease in interest income is primarily due to the conversion of some notes receivable to fee simple interests in The Meadows and certain Ellenburg Communities. Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 of approximately $2.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 6.3% and 5.4% per annum, respectively.  Operating Expenses       The increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio reflects increases in repairs and maintenance expense, payroll expense and increases in utility expenses passed through and included in utility income. These increases are partially offset by decreased property general and administrative, insurance and other expenses. Core Portfolio real estate taxes increased 6.3% generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. The increase in Total Portfolio property operating and maintenance expense and real estate taxes is also impacted by the acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property revenues, increased 9.7%. The increase was primarily due to the addition of senior management personnel in the areas of operations, human resources and accounting and the incremental expenses related to management of Properties acquired in 1998 and 1999.       General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased payroll resulting from salary increases and increased public company related expenses.       Interest and related amortization increased due to higher weighted average outstanding debt balances during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 were $738.1 million and $696.0 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.2% per annum for both years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.       Depreciation on corporate assets increased due to fixed asset additions related to information and communication systems. Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs increased due to fixed asset additions of Properties acquired in 1999 and 1998.                                         23    24 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY       As of December 31, 2000, the Company had $2.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $90.1 million available on its line of credit. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing line of credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to working capital.       In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute 95% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains). The following distributions have been declared and / or paid to common stockholders and minority interests since January 1, 1998.

Distributions on the Preferred Units were paid quarterly on the last calendar day of each quarter beginning December 31, 1999. The Company expects to continue to make regular quarterly distributions and has set its 2001 distribution to common stockholders at $1.78 per share per annum.  MORTGAGES AND CREDIT FACILITIES       On February 24, 2000, the Company entered into mortgage agreements collateralizing two Properties for a total of $14.6 million. The mortgage notes mature on March 1, 2010, amortize beginning March 1, 2000 over 30 years and bear interest at a rate of approximately 8.3% per annum.       On June 30, 2000, the Company obtained $110 million in debt financing consisting of two mortgage notes - one for $94.3 million and one for $15.7 million - secured by seven Properties. The proceeds of the financing were used to repay $60 million of mortgage debt secured by the seven Properties, to repay amounts outstanding under the Company's line of credit and for working capital purposes. The Company recorded a $1.0 million extraordinary loss (net of $264,000 allocated to Minority Interests) in connection with the early repayment of the $60 million of mortgage debt.       On April 3, 2000, the Company extended to April 3, 2002 the maturity of its $100 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of banks with interest only payable monthly at a rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.0%.       On August 9, 2000, the Company amended its unsecured line of credit with a bank (the "Credit Agreement") bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.125%. Among other things, the amendment lowered the total facility under the Credit Agreement to $150 million and extended the maturity to August 9, 2003. The Company pays a quarterly fee on the average unused amount of such credit equal to 0.15% of such amount.                                         24    25      Certain of the Company's mortgage and credit agreements contain covenants and restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured debt versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed charges-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), limitations on certain holdings and other restrictions.  ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND INVESTMENTS       On January 6, 1998, the Company funded a $12.3 million loan (the "Meadows Loan") to Meadows Preservation, Inc. The Meadows Loan was collateralized by The Meadows manufactured home community located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. On April 1, 1999, the Company effectively exchanged the Meadows Loan for an equity and debt interest in the partnership that owns The Meadows. The Company consolidates The Meadows and the related results of operations.       On July 23, 1999, the Company acquired Coquina Crossing, located in St. Augustine, Florida, for a purchase price of approximately $10.4 million. The acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Coquina Crossing is a 748-site senior community with 269 developed sites and zoned expansion potential for 479 sites. In addition, Realty Systems, Inc. ("RSI"), an affiliate of the Company, purchased the model home inventory at the community for approximately $1.1 million.       On February 29, 2000, MHC Systems, Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, disposed of the water and wastewater service company and facilities known as FFEC-Six in a cash sale. Net proceeds from the sale of approximately $4.2 million were used to pay down the Company's line of credit and a gain on the sale of $719,000 (or $.02 per fully diluted share) was recorded in other income on the accompanying statement of operations.       In April 2000, the California Superior Court approved a settlement agreement (the "Settlement") in connection with the dissolution proceeding of ECC and its affiliated partnerships. As part of the Settlement, the Company received $13.5 million previously held in escrow in connection with the purchase of the Ellenburg Communities and recorded $3.0 million of interest income related to these funds. In connection with the Settlement, the Company sold three communities - Mesa Regal RV Resort, Mon Dak and Naples Estates - for an aggregate sales price of $59.0 million, including cash proceeds of $40.0 million and assumption of debt by the purchaser of $19.0 million. The Company recorded a $9.1 million gain on the sale of these Properties. Proceeds from the Settlement and property sales were used to pay down the Company's line of credit.       On December 28, 2000, the Company, through its joint venture with Meadows Management Company, acquired a 50% economic interest in Voyager RV Resort, a 1,576 site RV resort in Tucson, Arizona, for total consideration of $8.0 million. The Company's investment included cash of $3.0 million, its 50% interest in land held through the joint venture valued at $2.0 million and notes receivable from the principals of Meadows Management Company totaling $3.0 million.  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS       Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as recurring capital expenditures ("Recurring CapEx"), site development costs and corporate headquarters costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $7.9 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of these expenditures, the Company believes that approximately $6.5 million or $130 per site for 2000 and $6.3 million or $122 per site for 1999 are non-revenue producing improvements which are necessary in order to increase and/or maintain occupancy levels and maintain competitive market rents for new and renewing residents. Site development costs were approximately $7.9 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's Properties.  EQUITY TRANSACTIONS       On March 26, 1999, the Operating Partnership repurchased and cancelled 200,000 OP Units from a limited partner of the Operating Partnership.       On September 30, 1999, the Operating Partnership completed a $125 million private placement of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Units ("POP Units") to two institutional investors. The POP Units, which are callable by the Company after five years, have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Net proceeds from the offering of $121 million were used to repay amounts outstanding under the Company's line of credit facility and for other corporate purposes.                                         25    26      In March 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase plan whereby the Company was authorized to repurchase and retire shares of its common stock. Under the plan, the Company repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of Common Stock at an average price of $24.06 per share during the year ended December 31, 2000 and 4.1 million shares of Common Stock at an average price of $23.40 per share during the year ended December 31, 1999, using proceeds from borrowings on the line of credit.  INFLATION       Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS       FFO was redefined by NAREIT in October 1999, effective January 1, 2000, as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REIT's computations. Funds available for distribution ("FAD") is defined as FFO less non-revenue producing capital expenditures and amortization payments on mortgage loan principal. The Company believes that FFO and FAD are useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, they provide investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO and FAD in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF MARKET RISK       The Company's earnings are affected by changes in interest rates, as a portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on LIBOR. The Company's $150 million line of credit ($59.9 million outstanding at December 31, 2000) bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% and the Company's $100 million Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0%. If LIBOR increased/decreased by 1.0% during 2000, interest expense would have increased/decreased by approximately $1.7 million based on the combined average balance outstanding under the Company's line of credit and Term Loan for the year ended December 31, 2000.       In July 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at 6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only of legal costs that were deemed immaterial. The value of the 1998 Swap was impacted by changes in the market rate of interest. Had the 1998 Swap been entered into on December 31, 1999, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have been approximately 6.57%. Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap rate for the 1998 Swap increases or decreases the value of the 1998 Swap versus its current value by approximately $28,000. The Company accounted for the 1998 Swap as a hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap were accounted for as an adjustment to interest expense. On January 10, 2000, the Company unwound the 1998 Swap and received $1.0 million of proceeds which is amortized into interest expense through March 2003.       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". SFAS No. 133 permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement No. 137 which deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to all fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 will require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company has determined that the effect of SFAS No. 133 on the earnings and financial position of the Company will not be significant when implemented.  ITEM 8.
