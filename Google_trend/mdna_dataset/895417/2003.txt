In 2002, occupancy in our Core Portfolio decreased 1.3%. Also during 2002, average monthly base rental rates for the Core Portfolio increased approximately 5.3%. We project continued growth during 2003 in our Core Portfolio performance. Core Portfolio base rental-rate growth is expected to be approximately 4 percent. Assuming current economic conditions continue to impact occupancies, overall revenue growth will be approximately 2.5 to 3 percent. Core Portfolio operating expenses are expected to grow in excess of CPI due to continued increases in insurance, real estate taxes and utility expenses. These projections would result in growth of approximately 2 percent in Core Portfolio income from operations (also referred to as net operating income or "NOI").  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES        Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.        We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.        The valuation of financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments" ("SFAS No. 107") and Statement No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Where possible, we base the fair values of our financial instruments, including our derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, we base our estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instrument.        Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We use a 30-year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life. The determination of useful lives, salvage value, and depreciation method used are in conformity with GAAP. However, the useful lives, salvage value, and customary depreciation method used for land improvements and other significant assets may significantly and materially overstate the depreciation of the underlying assets and therefore understate the Net Income of the Company. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") is currently reviewing the methods of depreciation and cost capitalization for all industries and in June 2001 issued FASB Exposure Draft, "Accounting in Interim and Annual Financial Statements for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant and Equipment", the implementation of which, if issued, could also have a material effect on the Company's results of operations.        Certain costs, primarily legal costs, relative to our efforts to effectively change the use and operations of several Properties subject to rent control (see Note 17) are currently classified in other assets. These costs, to the extent these efforts are successful, are capitalized to the extent of the established value of the revised project and included in the net investment in real estate for the appropriate Properties (see Note 5). To the extent these efforts are not successful, these costs will be expensed. In addition, we capitalize certain costs, primarily legal costs, related to entering into lease agreements which govern the term under which we may enter into leases with individual tenants and which are expensed over the term of the lease agreement.        In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The Interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of Interpretation 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company will adopt FIN 46 in the third quarter of 2003. We have not yet determined the effect the adoption of the Interpretation will have on the Company.                                          21        We have chosen to account for our stock compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", based upon the intrinsic value method, which results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Common Shares on the date of grant. We will elect to account for our stock compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", effective in the first quarter of 2003, which will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock option compensation issued. We have not yet determined the effect the statement will have on the Company.                                          22  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001        Since December 31, 2000, the gross investment in real estate increased from $1,218 million to $1,296 million as of December 31, 2002, due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period. The total number of sites owned or controlled increased from 51,304 as of December 31, 2000 to 51,582 as of December 31, 2002.

Property Operating Revenues        The 4.1% increase in Community base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a 5.3% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 1.2% decrease in average occupied sites. The decrease in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to decreases in utility income, which resulted from lower expenses for these items.  Property Operating Expenses        The increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in property payroll, insurance and other expenses, repair and maintenance and administrative expenses, partially offset by decreased utility expense. The increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes is generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties.

As a result of the acquisition of RSI (see Note 7), the Company owns and controls RSI and consolidates the financial results of RSI with those of the Company. The pro forma presentation of detailed 2001 amounts is for comparison purposes and has no effect on previously reported net income. For the year ended December 31, 2001, equity in income of affiliates was approximately $1.8 million and included the $2.3 million of income from home sales operations presented above as well as $539,000 of interest income, $15,000 of corporate expenses and $1.0 million of interest expense.        New home sales gross profit reflects a 13.4% decrease in sales volume coupled with a 1.1% increase in the gross margin. The average selling price of new homes increased $6,000 or 8.7% compared to 2001. Used home gross profit reflects a decrease in both volume and gross margin on used home sales. Brokered resale revenues reflects decreased resale volumes. The 6.9% decrease in home selling expenses primarily reflects reductions in payroll and advertising expenses.  Other Income and Expenses        The increase in interest income reflects a decrease in notes receivable offset by an increase in chattel notes receivable acquired through the acquisition of RSI. The decrease in other corporate income primarily reflects decreased income from unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in general and administrative expense is due to increases in costs related to operating a public company, increased payroll costs and increased consulting and legal costs. Interest and related amortization decreased due to lower interest rates during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $731.8 million and $713.2 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 6.8% and 7.0% per annum for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.                                          24  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000        Since December 31, 1999, the gross investment in real estate decreased from $1,264 million to $1,238 million as of December 31, 2001, due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period. The total number of sites owned or controlled decreased from 53,846 as of December 31, 1999 to 50,663 as of December 31, 2001.        The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Core Portfolio and the Total Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

For comparison purposes, a       reclassification was made to base rental income for 2000 on this table.       This reclassification is also reflected in the monthly base rent per site       amounts for 2000.  (2)   Site and occupancy information excludes Properties owned through       unconsolidated joint ventures and Resort Properties.  Property Operating Revenues        The 4.7% increase in base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a 4.5% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 0.2% increase in average occupied sites. The increase in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in pass through items such as utilities and real estate taxes - which resulted from higher expenses for these items. For the Total Portfolio, changes in base rental income and utility and other income generally reflect those of the Core Portfolio and the effect of acquisition and disposition of the Non-Core Properties.                                          25  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  Property Operating Expenses        The increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility expenses passed through and included in utility income. Expenses for the Core Portfolio also reflect increases in payroll and property insurance expenses. Core Portfolio real estate taxes increased 2.8% generally due to higher assessed values on certain Properties. The increase in Total Portfolio property operating and maintenance expense and real estate taxes is also impacted by acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties. Property management expense allocated to the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property revenues, increased 5.8%.  Other Income and Expenses        Equity in income of affiliates decreased 24.8%, reflecting lower sales volumes. Combined home sales revenue decreased approximately $4.0 million, of which $3.3 million is attributable to a decline in new home inventory sales volume. Sales volumes for new home inventory, used home inventory and brokered home sales were 485, 250 and 1,114, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001, and 535, 290 and 1,271, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2000.        The decrease in interest income is primarily due to the repayment of certain notes receivable, fewer short-term investments and lower interest rates. Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 of approximately $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 3.8% and 6.0% per annum, respectively.        General and administrative expenses ("G&A") increased 4.1% due to increased public company costs and related expenses and promotional costs. G&A for 2001 includes a charge for additional amortization of deferred compensation offset by a reversal of legal expenses previously accrued related to the Ellenburg settlement.        Interest and related amortization decreased due to lower interest rates during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $713.2 million and $707.5 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.0% and 7.4% per annum for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.        Depreciation on corporate assets increased due to fixed asset additions related to information and communication systems. Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs increased due primarily to the acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties.                                          26  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY        As of December 31, 2002, we had $7.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $65.3 million available on our Line of Credit. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions, generally through our working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing Line of Credit. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under our existing Line of Credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to working capital.  INFLATION        Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize our risks to inflation.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS        FFO, a non-GAAP financial performance measure, was redefined by NAREIT in April 2002, as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs' computations. Funds available for distribution ("FAD") is defined as FFO less non-revenue producing capital expenditures and amortization payments on mortgage loan principal. The Company believes that FFO and FAD are useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, they provide investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO and FAD in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.        The following table presents a calculation of FFO and FAD for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (amounts in thousands):                                                                   2002       2001       2000                                                              --------   --------   --------        COMPUTATION OF FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS:    Income before extraordinary loss on early       extinguishment of debt ..............................  $ 36,445   $ 32,083   $ 32,986    Income allocated to Common OP Units ....................     8,926      8,209      8,463    Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs .....    35,911     34,728     34,312    Depreciation expense included in discontinued operations       125        105         99    Gain on sale of Properties and other ...................

In connection with the Settlement, we sold three communities - Mesa Regal RV Resort, Mon Dak and Naples Estates - for an aggregate sales price of $59.0 million, including cash proceeds of $40.0 million and assumption of debt by the purchaser of $19.0 million. On February 29, 2000, MHC Systems, Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, sold the water and wastewater service company and facilities known as FFEC-Six in a cash sale with net proceeds of approximately $4.2 million.        During the year ended December 31, 2001, we acquired two Florida Properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $17.3 million and completed the sale of seven properties in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, for a total sale price of approximately $17.4 million. Also during 2001, we finalized a settlement agreement whereby we received $10.8 million in proceeds related to the sale of a Property in Indiana.        During the year ended December 31, 2002, we acquired the eleven Properties listed in the table below. The acquisitions were funded with borrowings on our Line of Credit and the assumption of $47.9 million of mortgage debt, which includes a $3.0 million mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we purchased adjacent land and land improvements for several Properties for approximately $559,000.

In addition, we sold Camelot Acres, a 319 site Property in Burnsville, Minnesota, for approximately $14.2 million.  INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES        On December 28, 2000, the Company, through its joint venture with Meadows Management Company, acquired a 50% economic interest in Voyager RV Resort, a 1,576 site RV resort in Tucson, Arizona, for total consideration of $8.0 million. The Company's investment included cash of $3.0 million, its 50% interest in land held through the joint venture valued at $2.0 million and notes receivable from the principals of Meadows Management Company totaling $3.0 million.        Effective September 1, 2002, the Company restructured its investment in Wolverine Property Investment Limited Partnership (the "College Heights Joint Venture" or the "Venture"), a joint venture with Wolverine Investors, LLP. The Venture included 18 Properties with 3,581 sites. The results of operations of the College Heights Joint Venture prior to restructuring were included with the results of the Company due to the Company's voting equity interest and control over the Venture. Pursuant to the restructuring, the Company sold its general partnership interest, sold all of the Company's voting equity interest and reduced the Company's total investment in the College Heights Joint Venture. As consideration for the sale, the Company retained sole ownership of Down Yonder, a 361 site community in Clearwater, Florida, received cash of approximately $5.2 million and retained preferred limited partnership interests of approximately $10.3 million, recorded net of a $2.4 million reserve. The continuing preferred limited partnership interests are accounted for using the equity method and reported as an investment in a joint venture.                                          28  ACQUISITION OF REALTY SYSTEMS, INC.        On January 1, 2002, the Company purchased all of the common stock of Realty Systems, Inc. ("RSI"). The Company previously owned the non-voting preferred stock of RSI and had notes receivable from RSI which were recorded as an investment in affiliate. The Company purchased the common stock of RSI from Equity Group Investments, Inc., controlled by Samuel Zell, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, for approximately $675,000. As a result of this acquisition, the Company owns and controls RSI and consolidates the financial results of RSI with those of the Company including $839,000 of cash from the acquisition on January 1, 2002.  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS        Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as recurring capital expenditures ("Recurring CapEx"), site development costs and corporate costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $13.4 million and $12.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Of these expenditures, the Company believes that approximately $7.6 million or $147 per site for 2002 and $7.1 million or $142 per site for 2001 are non-revenue producing improvements which are necessary in order to increase and/or maintain occupancy levels and maintain competitive market rents for new and renewing residents. Site development costs were approximately $10.4 million and $9.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's Properties and costs for improvements to sites when a smaller used home is replaced with a larger new home.  EQUITY TRANSACTIONS        In March 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase plan whereby we were authorized to repurchase and retire shares of its common stock. No shares of Common Stock were repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2002 or 2001.

Distributions on the Preferred Units were paid annual on the last calendar day of each quarter beginning December 31, 1999. The Company expects to continue to make regular annual distributions and has set its 2003 distribution to common stockholders at $1.98 per share per annum.                                          29  MORTGAGES AND CREDIT FACILITIES        We have an unsecured Line of Credit with a group of banks (the "Line of Credit") with a total facility of $150 million, bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.125% that matures on August 9, 2003 with two one-year extension options with which we may extend the maturity through August 9, 2005. We pay a quarterly fee on the average unused amount of the total facility equal to 0.15% of such amount. As of December 31, 2002, $65.3 million was available under the Credit Agreement.        We have a $100 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of banks with interest only payable monthly at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") of LIBOR plus 1.375% that matures on August 9, 2003 with two one-year extension options with which we may extend the maturity through August 9, 2005        On October 29, 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "2001 Swap"), effectively fixing LIBOR on $100 million of our floating rate debt at approximately 3.7% per annum for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of the 2001 Swap require monthly settlements on the same dates interest payments are due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133 as herein defined, the 2001 Swap will be reflected at market value. We believe the 2001 Swap is a perfectly effective cash flow hedge, under SFAS No. 133, and there will be no effect on net income as a result of the mark-to-market adjustments.        During the year ended December 31, 2000, we entered into mortgage agreements collateralizing two Properties for a total of $14.6 million. The mortgage notes mature on March 1, 2010, amortize beginning March 1, 2000 over 30 years and bear interest at a rate of approximately 8.3% per annum. In addition, we obtained $110 million in debt financing consisting of two mortgage notes - one for $94.3 million and one for $15.7 million - secured by seven Properties. The proceeds of the financing were used to repay $60 million of mortgage debt secured by the seven Properties and to repay amounts outstanding under the Company's Line of Credit and for working capital purposes. The Company recorded a $1.0 million extraordinary loss (net of $264,000 allocated to Minority Interests) in connection with the early repayment of the $60 million of mortgage debt.        During the year ended December 31, 2001, we repaid three maturing mortgages in the amount of $12.1 million using proceeds from our Line of Credit. In addition, we entered into a $50.0 million mortgage note (the "Stagecoach Mortgage") collateralized by 7 Properties beneficially owned by MHC Stagecoach, L.L.C. The Stagecoach Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 6.98% per annum, amortizes beginning September 1, 2001 over 10 years and matures August 31, 2011. Proceeds from the financing were used to reduce borrowings on the Line of Credit by $37.9 million.        During the year ended December 31, 2002, as part of the purchase of RSI, in a non-cash transaction, we assumed a $12.5 million note payable ("Conseco Financing Note"), collateralized by manufactured home inventory. The Conseco Financing Note was repaid at a discount during the year using proceeds from our Line of Credit. In addition, we repaid a maturing mortgage note in the amount of $1.1 million and $2.1 million of other unsecured notes payable using proceeds from our Line of Credit.        Aggregate payments of principal on long-term borrowings for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (amounts in thousands):                                  YEAR                       AMOUNT              --------------------------------------    -----------                                  2003                     $    13,753                               2004                          38,758                               2005                         193,377                               2006                          19,965                               2007                         268,494                            Thereafter                      225,190              Net unamortized premiums and discounts            696                                                        -----------                              Total                     $   760,233                                                        ===========         Certain of our mortgage and credit agreements contain covenants and restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured debt versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed charges-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), limitations on certain holdings and other restrictions.                                          30  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF MARKET RISK        Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates, since a portion of our outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on LIBOR. Our Line of Credit ($84.8 million outstanding at December 31, 2002) bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% per annum and our $100 million Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0% per annum. If LIBOR increased/decreased by 1.0% during 2002, interest expense would have increased/decreased by approximately $1.6 million based on the combined average balance outstanding under the Company's Line of Credit and Term Loan for the year ended December 31, 2002.        In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 and its amendments, Statements 137 and 138 in June of 1999 and June of 2000, respectively. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.        In July 1998, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "1998 Swap") effectively fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at 6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only of legal costs that were deemed immaterial. The value of the 1998 Swap was impacted by changes in the market rate of interest. We accounted for the 1998 Swap as a hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap were accounted for as an adjustment to interest expense. On January 10, 2000, we unwound the 1998 Swap and received $1.0 million of proceeds which is amortized into interest expense through March 2003.        On October 29, 2001, we entered into the 2001 Swap, fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at approximately 3.7% for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of the 2001 Swap require monthly settlements on the same dates that interest payments are due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the interest rate 2001 Swap is reflected at market value. We believe the 2001 Swap is a perfectly effective cash flow hedge per SFAS No. 133 and there will be no effect on net income as a result of the mark-to-market adjustment. As of December 31, 2002, the 2001 Swap represented a liability of approximately $4.5 million and is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Mark-to-market changes in the value of the 2001 Swap are included in other comprehensive income.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
