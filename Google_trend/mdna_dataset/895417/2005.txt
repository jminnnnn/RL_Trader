ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which reflect management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of future events on the Company's financial performance; the adverse impact of external factors such as inflation and consumer confidence; interest rates; and the risks associated with real estate ownership.  2004 ACCOMPLISHMENTS       -    Invested in 135 Properties with approximately 50,000 sites.       -    Increased presence in Florida and Arizona markets.       -    Increased home sales volumes and profitability.       -    Changed our name from Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. to Equity           Lifestyle Properties, Inc., symbolizing our focus on           lifestyle-oriented customers.       -    Developed relationships with leading brand names such as Encore and           Thousand Trails, creating a larger customer resource base.  OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK       Occupancy in our Properties as well as our ability to increase rental rates directly affect revenues. Our revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting our sites on a long-term basis.       We have approximately 58,200 annual sites with average annual revenue of approximately $4,400 per site. We have 7,200 seasonal sites, which are leased to customers generally for 3 to 6 months, for which we expect to collect rent in the range of $1,700 to $1,800. We also have 6,000 transient sites, occupied by customers who lease on a short-term basis, for which we expect to collect annual rent in the range of $2,000 to $2,100. We expect to service 60,000 customers with these sites. There is significant demand for these sites. However, we consider this revenue stream to be our most volatile. It is subject to weather conditions, gas prices, and other factors affecting the marginal RV customer's vacation and travel preferences. Finally, we have approximately 17,900 Thousand Trails sites for which we receive ground rent of $16 million annually. This rent is classified in Other Income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have interests in Properties owning approximately 11,800 sites for which revenue is classified as Equity in Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.                                          22  PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND DISPOSITIONS       The following chart lists the Properties or portfolios acquired, invested in, or sold since January 1, 2003:    PROPERTY                                                   TRANSACTION DATE     SITES - --------                                                  ------------------   -------      TOTAL SITES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003......................                         52,349  PROPERTY OR PORTFOLIO (# OF PROPERTIES IN PARENTHESES):    Toby's..............................................

As a result, the Company has restated its Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 to expense the costs of the initiatives in the year in which they were incurred because the previous method of accounting for the costs was determined to be incorrect. The Company had historically classified these costs, primarily legal, in other assets. To the extent the Company's efforts to effectively change the use and operations of the Properties were successful, the Company capitalized the costs to land improvements as an increase in the established value of the revised project and depreciated them over 30 years. To the extent these efforts were not successful, the costs would have been expensed.       See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report for a summary of the effects of these changes on the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2003 and consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The accompanying Management's Discussion and Analysis gives effect to these corrections. The significance of the increase in expenses due to this change is not necessarily determinable in future periods and depend on future rulings of the United States Supreme Court.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES       Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.       In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS No. 141"), we allocate the purchase price of Properties we acquire to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.       We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.       Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We use a 30-year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life. However, the useful lives, salvage value, and customary depreciation method used for land improvements and other significant assets may significantly and materially overstate the depreciation of the underlying assets and therefore understate the net income of the Company.       In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46R") - - an interpretation of ARB 51. The objective of FIN 46R is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity ("VIE") and determine when the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and results of operations of a VIE need to be included in a company's consolidated financial statements. A company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate such entity if the company absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses or receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns if they occur, or both (i.e., the primary beneficiary). The Company will apply FIN 46R to all types of entity ownership (general and limited partnerships and corporate interests).       The Company will re-evaluate and apply the provisions of FIN 46R to existing entities if certain events occur which warrant re-evaluation of such entities. In addition, the Company will apply the provisions of FIN 46R to all new entities in the future. The Company also consolidates entities in which it has a controlling direct or indirect voting interest. The equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which the Company does not have a                                          24  controlling direct or indirect voting interest, but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions. The cost method is applied when (i) the investment is minimal (typically less than 5%) and (ii) the Company's investment is passive.       In applying the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company determined that its $29.7 million investment in preferred equity interests (the "Mezzanine Investment") in six entities controlled by Diversified Investments, Inc. ("Diversified") (see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investing Activities) is a VIE; however, the Company concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary. As such, the adoption of this pronouncement had no effect on the Company's financial statements.       The valuation of financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments" ("SFAS No. 107") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Where possible, we base the fair values of our financial instruments, including our derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, we base our estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instrument.       Prior to January 1, 2003 we accounted for our stock compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", based upon the intrinsic value method. This method results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, we elected to account for our stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment ("SFAS No. 148"), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", which will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock options and other equity awards issued. SFAS No. 148 provides three possible transition methods for changing to the fair value method. We have elected to use the modified-prospective method. This method requires that we recognize stock-based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value method had been used to account for all employee awards granted, or settled, in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method was applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period presented (amounts in thousands, except per share data):                                                             2003         2002                                               2004    (Restated)   (Restated)                                             -------   ----------   ----------        Net income available for Common    Shares as reported ...................   $ 4,026    $25,132      $31,887 Add: Stock-based compensation    expense included in net income as    reported .............................     2,899      2,139        2,185 Deduct: Stock-based compensation    expense determined under the fair    value based method for all awards ....

The total number of sites owned or controlled increased from 52,349 as of December 31, 2003 to 101,231 as of December 31, 2004.       The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Property Operations for the Core Portfolio (excludes RV and Resort Cottage sites, and Properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as the sites of Properties acquired or sold during 2003 and 2004) and the Total Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

(2)  Site and occupancy information excludes all Resort Cottage and RV sites,      Properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures as well as the sites      of Properties acquired or sold during 2003 and 2004.  PROPERTY OPERATING REVENUES       The 3.0% increase in Community base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a 4.7% increase in monthly base rent per site combined with a 1.6% decrease in average occupied sites. The increase in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility income, which resulted from higher utility expenses. Total Portfolio operating revenues increased due to current year acquisitions (see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).                                          26  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES       The 4.4% increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in payroll expense, administrative expense, repair and maintenance expense. The 5.4% increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes is generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues, increased by 1.2% due to increases in payroll costs and computer expenses, but remains at approximately 4% of revenue. Total Portfolio operating expenses increased due to our current year acquisitions.  HOME SALES OPERATIONS       The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Home Sales Operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Used home sales gross profit reflects an increase in gross margin on used home sales and an increase in volume. Brokered resale revenues reflects increased resale volumes. The 18.3% increase in home selling expenses primarily reflects increases in insurance cost and other expenses. The increase in ancillary service revenue relates primarily to income from property amenities at our newly acquired Properties.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES       The increase in other expenses reflects an increase in interest expense resulting from the Recap borrowing in October 2003 (see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K) and additional debt assumed in the 2004 acquisitions, an increase in depreciation on real estate assets related to the 2004 acquisitions, and increased general and administrative expense due to increased payroll. This is partially offset by income from other investments that includes $2.3 million of lease income from the Thousand Trails ground lease entered into on November 10, 2004.                                          27  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  EQUITY IN INCOME OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES       During 2004, we invested in preferred equity interests, the Mezzanine Investment, in six entities containing 11 Properties and 5,054 sites. Our average return on the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a rate of 10% per annum. We also invested in 11 separate joint ventures (see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investing Activities). These investments contributed to the increase in equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures.  COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002       Since December 31, 2001, the gross investment in real estate increased from $1,238 million to $1,310 million as of December 31, 2003, due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period. The total number of sites owned or controlled increased from 50,663 as of December 31, 2001 to 51,715 as of December 31, 2003.       The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Property Operations for the Core Portfolio and the Total Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

PROPERTY OPERATING REVENUES       The 3.2% increase in Community base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a 5.1% increase in monthly base rent per site combined with a 1.9% decrease in average occupied sites. The increase in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility income, which resulted from higher expenses for these items.                                          28  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES  The 3.7% increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in insurance and other expenses, utility expense, and repair and maintenance expense, administrative expenses and payroll expense. The 5.8% increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes is generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues, increased by 1.5% due to increases in payroll costs and computer expenses.  HOME SALES OPERATIONS       The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Home Sales Operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

The average selling price of new homes remained steady year over year. Used home sales gross profit reflects a decrease in gross margin on used home sales, partially offset by an increase in volume. Brokered resale revenues reflect increased resale volumes. The 4.0% decrease in home selling expenses primarily reflects reductions in advertising expenses.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES       In October 2003, we received approximately $501 million from the Recap. The cash received from the Recap was used to pay down our Line of Credit and pay off our Term Loan, with the remainder placed in short-term investments to be used for payment of a special distribution in January 2004 and for future acquisitions. As a result, interest income increased reflecting additional interest earned on short-term investments with an average balance of $273 million. The decrease in general and administrative expense is due to decreased professional fees and public company costs, partially offset by increased payroll costs and banking expenses. Rent control initiatives decreased by $3.4 million due to lower costs relating to the DeAnza Santa Cruz and Contempo Marin Properties. Interest and related amortization increased due to the Recap and the payment of approximately $3 million to unwind the 2001 Swap (hereinafter defined), partially offset by decreased interest rates during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $800 million and $731.8 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 6.4% and 6.8% per annum for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.                                          29  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)       The increase in income from other investments was due to the restructuring of the Company's investment in Wolverine Property Investment Limited Partnership (the "College Heights Joint Venture" or the "Venture"), a joint venture with Wolverine Investors, LLP, effective September 1, 2002. The Venture included 18 Properties with 3,581 sites. The results of operations of the College Heights Joint Venture prior to restructuring were included with the results of the Company due to the Company's voting equity interest and control over the Venture. Pursuant to the restructuring, the Company sold its general partnership interest, sold all of the Company's voting equity interest and reduced the Company's total investment in the College Heights Joint Venture. As consideration for the sale, the Company retained sole ownership of Down Yonder, a 361 site Property in Clearwater, Florida, received cash of approximately $5.2 million and retained preferred limited partnership interests of approximately $10.3 million, recorded net of a $2.4 million reserve included in other assets. Income of approximately $1.0 million and $0.2 million has been recorded in income from other investments for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  INFLATION       Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation to the Company.  LIQUIDITY       As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $5.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $44.2 million available on its line of credit. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing line of credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to net cash provided by operating activities. The table below summarizes cash flow activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in thousands).

This decrease reflects increased interest expense as a result of the Recap in October, 2003 and increases in working capital, partially offset by increases in property operating income as discussed in "Results of Operations" above. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $80.2 million in 2002. This was primarily due to an increase in working capital.                                          30  INVESTING ACTIVITIES       Net cash used in investing activities reflects the impact of the following investing activities:  ACQUISITIONS       During the year ended December 31, 2004, we acquired 111 Properties (see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K). The combined investment in real estate for these 111 Properties was approximately $703 million and was funded with monies held in short-term investments, debt assumed of $352 million which includes a mark-to-market adjustment of $10.4 million, new financing of $124 million, and borrowings from our Line of Credit. Included in the above as previously described are 57 Properties purchased as part of the Thousand Trails Transaction; the income related to this transaction is classified as income from other investments on the Consolidated Statements of Operation.       We assumed inventory of approximately $1.2 million, other assets of $4.9 million, rents received in advance of approximately $13.6 million and other liabilities of approximately $5.8 million in connection with the 2004 acquisitions. The Company also issued common OP units for value of approximately $32.2 million.       During 2003, we acquired three Properties at a purchase price of $11.8 million. The acquisitions were funded with monies held in short-term investments and debt assumed of $4.6 million. The acquisitions included the assumption of liabilities of approximately $0.7 million. Also during 2003, we acquired a parcel of land adjacent to one of our Properties for approximately $0.1 million.       During 2002, we acquired eleven Properties at a purchase price of $101.6 million. The acquisitions were funded with borrowings on our Line of Credit and the assumption of $47.9 million of mortgage debt, which includes a $3.0 million mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we purchased adjacent land and land improvements for several Properties for approximately $0.6 million.  DISPOSITIONS       During the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold one Property located in Lake Placid, Florida for a selling price of $3.4 million, with net proceeds of $0.8 million received in July 2004. No gain or loss on disposition was recognized in the period. The operating results have been reflected in discontinued operations. In addition, we sold approximately 1.4 acres of land in Montana for a gain and net proceeds of $0.6 million.       During 2003, we sold three Properties for proceeds of $27.1 million and a gain of $10.8 million. Proceeds from the sales were used to repay amounts on our Line of Credit.       During 2002, we effectively sold 17 Properties as part of a restructuring of the College Heights Venture (hereinafter defined). In addition, we sold Camelot Acres, a 319 site Property in Burnsville, Minnesota, for approximately $14.2 million.  INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO JOINT VENTURES       On February 3, 2004, the Company invested approximately $29.7 million in preferred equity interests (the "Mezzanine Investment") in six entities controlled by Diversified Investments, Inc. ("Diversified"). These entities own in the aggregate 11 Properties, containing 5,054 sites. Approximately $11.7 million of the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a per annum average rate of 10%, with a minimum pay rate of 6.5%, payable quarterly, and approximately $17.9 million of the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a per annum average rate of 11%, with a minimum pay rate of 7%, payable quarterly. To the extent the minimum pay rates on the respective Mezzanine Investments are not achieved, the accrual rates increase to 12% and 13% per annum, respectively. The Company can acquire these Properties in the future at capitalization rates of between 8% and 8.5%, beginning in 2006. In addition, the Company has invested approximately $1.4 million in the Diversified entities managing these 11 Properties, which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004.       During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company invested approximately $4.1 million in 11 joint ventures. The Company can acquire these Properties in the future at capitalization rates of between 8% and 8.5%, beginning in 2006.                                          31  INVESTING ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)       In addition, the Company recorded approximately $3.7 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million of net income from joint ventures (net of depreciation) in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively, and received approximately $5.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.6 million in distributions from such joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively. Included in such distributions for the year ended December 31, 2004 is $2.5 million return of capital, of which $0.5 million exceeded the Company's basis and thus was recorded in income from unconsolidated joint ventures and other.  OTHER INVESTMENTS       Effective September 1, 2002, the Company restructured its investment in the College Heights Joint Venture. The Venture included 18 Properties with 3,581 sites. The results of operations of the College Heights Joint Venture prior to restructuring were included with the results of the Company due to the Company's voting equity interest and control over the Venture. Pursuant to the restructuring, the Company sold its general partnership interest, sold all of the Company's voting equity interest and reduced the Company's total investment in the College Heights Joint Venture. As consideration for the sale, the Company retained sole ownership of Down Yonder, a 361 site Property in Clearwater, Florida, received cash of approximately $5.2 million and retained preferred limited partnership interests of approximately $10.3 million, recorded net of a $2.4 million reserve included in other assets. Income of approximately $0.9 million, $1.0 million and $0.2 million has been recorded in income from other investments for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively.  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS       Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as recurring capital expenditures ("Recurring CapEx"), site development costs and corporate costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $13.7 million, $11.9 million and $13.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively. Site development costs were approximately $13.0 million, $9.0 million and $10.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively, and represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's Properties and costs for improvements to sites when a smaller used home is replaced with a larger new home. Corporate costs such as computer hardware, office furniture and office improvements were $0.4 million, $0.1 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES       Net cash used in financing activities reflects the impact of the following:  EQUITY TRANSACTIONS       In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute 90% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) to its stockholders. The following distributions have been declared and paid to common stockholders and minority interests since January 1, 2002.      DISTRIBUTION       FOR THE QUARTER    STOCKHOLDER RECORD AMOUNT PER SHARE         ENDING                DATE            PAYMENT DATE - ----------------   ------------------   ------------------   ----------------             $0.4750           March 31, 2002       March 29, 2002     April 12, 2002      $0.4750            June 30, 2002        June 28, 2002      July 12, 2002      $0.4750       September 30, 2002   September 27, 2002   October 11, 2002      $0.4750        December 31, 2002    December 27, 2002   January 10, 2003       $0.4950           March 31, 2003       March 28, 2003     April 11, 2003      $0.4950            June 30, 2003        June 27, 2003      July 11, 2003      $0.4950       September 30, 2003   September 26, 2003   October 10, 2003       $8.00         December 31, 2003      January 8, 2004   January 16, 2004       $0.0125           March 31, 2004       March 26, 2004      April 9, 2004      $0.0125            June 30, 2004        June 25, 2004       July 9, 2004      $0.0125       September 30, 2004   September 24, 2004    October 8, 2004      $0.0125        December 31, 2004    December 31, 2004   January 14, 2005                                           32  FINANCING ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)       On December 12, 2003, we declared a one-time special distribution of $8.00 per share payable to stockholders of record on January 8, 2004. We used proceeds from the $501 million Recap in October 2003 to pay the special distribution on January 16, 2004. The special cash dividend is reflected on stockholders' 2004 1099-DIV issued in January 2005.       In connection with the $501 million Recap and subsequent special distribution, on February 27, 2004, the Company contributed all of its assets to MHC Trust, a newly formed Maryland real estate investment trust, including the Company's entire partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The Company determined that a taxable transaction in connection with the special distribution to stockholders would be in the Company's best interests. This was accomplished by the contribution of the Company's interest in the Operating Partnership to MHC Trust in exchange for all the common and preferred stock of MHC Trust. Due to the Company's tax basis in its interest in the Operating Partnership, the Company recognized $180 million of taxable income as a result of its contribution, as opposed to a nontaxable reduction of the Company's tax basis in its interest in the Operating Partnership. This restructuring resulted in a step-up in the Company's tax basis in its assets, generating future depreciation deductions, which in turn will reduce the Company's future distribution requirements. This provides the Company with greater financial flexibility and greater growth potential. The Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code, with its assets consisting of interests in MHC Trust. MHC Trust, in turn, also intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code and will continue to be the general partner of the Operating Partnership. On May 1, 2004, in connection with the restructuring, MHC Trust sold cumulative preferred stock to a limited number of unaffiliated investors.       During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, in connection with 2004 acquisitions the Company issued 1.2 million common OP Units valued at $36.7 million of which approximately $28.7 million has been classified as paid-in capital. On December 21, 2004 we redeemed 126,765 common OP Units for approximately $4.5 million of which approximately $3.5 million has been classified as paid-in capital.       The Operating Partnership paid distributions of 9.0% per annum on the $125 million of Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units ("Preferred Units"). Distributions on the Preferred Units were paid quarterly on the last calendar day of each quarter beginning September 30, 1999. The Company expects to continue to make regular quarterly distributions and has set its 2005 distribution to common stockholders at $0.10 per share per annum.  MORTGAGES AND CREDIT FACILITIES       We have two unsecured lines of credit of $110 million and $50 million which bear interest at a per annum rate of London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.65%. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company borrowed $135.8 million and paid down $20 million on its line of credit. On November 10, 2004, in connection with the Thousand Trails Transaction, we secured a $120 million three-year term loan at LIBOR plus 1.75%. In December 2004, we fixed $180 million of this variable debt for one year with a weighted average per annum interest rate of 4.7%.       During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the Company assumed mortgage and other debt of approximately $157 million, which was recorded at fair market value with the related premium being amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest rate. The Company borrowed an additional $194 million of mortgage debt for other acquisitions. The mortgages bear interest at weighted average rates ranging from 5.14% to 5.81% per annum, and mature at various dates through November 1, 2027.       In 2003, the Company initiated the Recap as a result of its belief in the stability of its cash flow from property operations and the attractive financing terms available to borrowers such as the Company in the secured debt markets. In conducting its evaluation of the use of proceeds from the Recap, the Company's Board of Directors believed that to the extent no attractive alternative use was available, a distribution to stockholders should occur. In late 2003, the Company identified acquisition targets which would use approximately $100 million of the $325 million in net proceeds resulting from the Recap. In December 2003, the Company's Board of Directors declared a distribution of approximately $225 million ($8 per share). During 2004, the Company identified additional acquisitions and has funded such acquisitions primarily with secured and unsecured borrowings.                                          33  FINANCING ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)       The Recap and subsequent borrowings in connection with acquisitions have significantly increased the Company's outstanding debt. The interest and principal payments required under these debt agreements materially increase the Company's future contractual payment obligations. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding debt balance was $1,653 million. In future years, the Company expects to pay annual interest and principal amortization under current obligations of approximately $114 million (not including the impact of scheduled maturities) compared to $57 million in 2003. In light of these increased cash flow requirements, the Company has reduced its annual dividend to common stockholders from approximately $44 million in 2003 to approximately $1 million in 2004. In addition, the Company expects its cash from operations to increase significantly in 2005 compared to 2003 due to the cash generated by newly-acquired Properties. To the extent cash flow from the Properties does not meet the Company's expectations, the Company's Board of Directors increases the annual dividend significantly, or the Company is required to make significant unexpected capital improvements or other payments, the Company's financial flexibility and ability to meet scheduled obligations could be negatively impacted. With respect to maturing debt, the Company has staggered the maturities of our long-term mortgage debt over an average of approximately 6 years, with no more than $330 million in principal maturities coming due in any single year. The Company believes that it will be able to refinance its maturing debt obligations on a secured or unsecured basis; however, to the extent the Company is unable to refinance its debt as it matures, it believes that it will be able to repay such maturing debt from asset sales and/or the proceeds from equity issuances. With respect to any refinancing of maturing debt, the Company's future cash flow requirements could be impacted by significant changes in interest rates or other debt terms, including required amortization payments.       In October 2003, we unwound an interest rate swap ("2001 Swap") agreement at a cost of approximately $3 million, which is included in interest and related amortization in 2003 in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The 2001 swap effectively fixed LIBOR on $100 million of our floating rate debt at approximately 3.7% per annum for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of the 2001 Swap required monthly settlements on the same dates interest payments were due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the 2001 Swap was reflected at market value.       On April 17, 2003, we entered into an agreement to refinance and increase the "Bay Indies Mortgage", a $44.5 million note, from approximately $21.9 million to $45 million. Under the new agreement, the Bay Indies Mortgage bears interest at 5.69% per annum, amortizes over 25 years and matures April 17, 2013. The net proceeds were used to pay down the Company's Line of Credit in April 2003. Also during the year ended December 31, 2003, mortgage notes payable on four other Properties were repaid totaling approximately $23.5 million using proceeds from borrowings on the Company's Line of Credit.       During the year ended December 31, 2002, as part of the purchase of RSI, in a non-cash transaction, we assumed a $12.5 million note payable ("Conseco Financing Note"), collateralized by our home inventory. The Conseco Financing Note was repaid at a discount during 2002 using proceeds from our Line of Credit. In addition, we repaid a maturing mortgage note in the amount of $1.1 million and $2.1 million of other unsecured notes payable using proceeds from our Line of Credit.       Certain of the Company's mortgage and credit agreements contain covenants and restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured debt versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed charges-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), limitations on certain holdings and other restrictions.                                          34  FINANCING ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)       As of December 31, 2004, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below (dollars in thousands):         CONTRACTUAL      OBLIGATIONS          TOTAL       2005     2006(2)    2007(3)     2008       2009    THEREAFTER      -----------       ----------   -------   --------   --------   --------   -------   ----------                Long Term    Borrowings (1)      $1,643,672   $18,742   $169,770   $432,350   $203,903   $70,558    $748,349 Weighted average    interest rates...         6.10%      ---       4.36%      6.43%      5.55%     6.58%       6.20%   (1)  Balance excludes net premiums and discounts of $9.4 million.  (2)  Includes Line of Credit repayment in 2006 of $115,800. We have an option to      extend this maturity for one year to 2007.  (3)  Includes a Term Loan repayment in 2007 of $105,600. We have an option to      extend this maturity for two successive years to 2009.       Included in the above table are certain capital lease obligations totaling approximately $7.0 million. These agreements expire June 2009 and are paid semi-annually.       In addition, the Company leases land under non-cancelable operating leases at certain of the Properties expiring in various years from 2022 to 2032 with terms which include minimum rent to be paid throughout the year plus additional rents calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, ground lease expense was approximately $1.6 million and $1.6 million respectively. Minimum future rental payments under the ground leases are approximately $1.6 million for each of the next five years and approximately $23.5 million thereafter.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS       Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe FFO, as defined by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), to be an appropriate measure of performance for an equity REIT. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity REITs, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance.       FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of Properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. We further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income and cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, when evaluating an equity REIT's operating performance. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.                                          35  FINANCING ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)       The following table presents a calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (amounts in thousands):                                                                                       2003         2002                                                                         2004    (Restated)   (Restated)                                                                       -------   ----------   ----------        COMPUTATION OF FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS:    Net income available for Common Shares .........................   $ 4,026    $ 25,132     $ 31,887    Income allocated to Common OP Units ............................       936       6,004        7,786    Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs .............    48,862      37,265       34,826    Depreciation expense included in discontinued operations .......        32         135          484    Depreciation expense included in equity in income from       joint ventures ..............................................     1,230         769          726    Gain on sale of Properties and other ...........................

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates. The primary market risk we face is long-term indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our long-term debt obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2004, approximately 97% or approximately $1.6 billion of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates, which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures. For each increase in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately $93.1 million. For each decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately $98.8 million.       At December 31, 2004, approximately 3% or approximately $56 million of our outstanding debt was short-term and at variable rates. Earnings are affected by increases and decreases in market interest rates on this debt. For each increase/decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), our earnings and cash flows would increase/decrease by approximately $538,000 annually.  ITEM 8.
