Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations          The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.   2007 Accomplishments                         Raised annual dividend to $0.80 per share in 2008, up from $0.60 per share in 2007.                           Successfully amended our existing unsecured Lines of Credit to expand our borrowing capacity from $275 million to $370 million.                           Acquired five Properties containing over 1,400 sites, including our outside joint venture partners interest in two Properties.                           Second year in row since 2000 that our manufactured home Properties owned year over year finished the year with a higher number of occupied sites than the number we started the year.                           Launched a new benefit program, RvontheGo Club, for members. Members receive discounts on entertainment and purchases at retailers, in addition to exclusive member-only discounts and advanced invitations to resort events.       Overview and Outlook          Occupancy in our Properties as well as our ability to increase rental rates directly affects revenues. Our revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting our sites on a long-term basis.        We have approximately 64,900 annual sites, approximately 8,700 seasonal sites, which are leased to customers generally for three to six months, and approximately 8,800 transient sites, occupied by customers who lease sites on a short-term basis. We expect to service over 100,000 customers with these transient sites. However, we consider this revenue stream to be our most volatile. It is subject to weather conditions, gas prices, and other factors affecting the marginal RV customers vacation and travel preferences. Finally, we have approximately 24,100 membership sites for which we will receive annual ground rent in 2008 of approximately $25.5 million. This rent is classified in Income from other investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (See also Privileged Access discussion below) We also have interests in Properties containing approximately 6,300 sites for which revenue is classified as Equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.                                                                 Total Sites as of Dec. 31,                (rounded to 000s)                2007         2006         Community sites (1)              44,800                   45,700           Resort sites (2):                                              Annual              20,100                   18,900           Seasonal              8,700                   8,000           Transient              8,800                   8,800           Membership (3)              24,100                   24,100           Joint Ventures (4)              6,300                   7,500                                                                         112,800                   113,000                                                                                    (1)         Includes 655 and 1,581 sites from discontinued operations as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.           (2)         Includes 100 sites from discontinued operations as of December 31, 2006, subsequently sold in January 2007.           (3)         All sites are currently leased to Privileged Access.           (4)         Joint Venture income is included in Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures.             Our home sales volumes and gross profits have been declining since 2005. We believe that the disruption in the site-built housing market may be contributing to the decline in our home sales operations as potential customers are not able to sell their existing site-built homes as well as increased price sensitivity for seasonal and second homebuyers. A number of factors have contributed to this disruption. In the last few years, many site-built home sales were for speculative or investment purposes. Innovative financing techniques, such as loan securitizations, provided increased credit access and resulted in overbuilding and excess site-built home supply. Bad lending practices, like no money down, diminshed underwriting, longer amortization periods and aggressive appraisals have contributed to loan defaults, repossessions and capital meltdowns. The disruption has not impacted our maufactured home occupancy, however, the anticipated continuation of the decline in our sales volumes may negatively impact occupancy in the future. In order to maintain and improve existing occupancy, ELS is focusing on new customer acquisition projects. During 2007, we have formed an occupancy task force (OTF) to review our portfolio for opportunities to increase occupancy. Programs being evaluated by the OTF include: purchasing homes for a rental program, renting existing inventory homes and providing additional financing options to home buyers.   32            Privileged Access          Privileged Access has been the owner of Thousand Trails (TT) since April 14, 2006. TTs primary business consists of entering into agreements with individuals to use its properties (the Agreements) and has been engaged in such business for almost 40 years. The properties are primarily campgrounds with designated sites for the placement of recreational vehicles to service its membership base of over 100,000 families. The campgrounds are owned by the Company and leased to Privileged Access. Privileged Access is headquartered in Frisco, Texas, and has more than 2,000 employees and is owned 100 percent by Mr. Joe McAdams, the Companys President effective January 1, 2008.        As of December 31, 2007, we are leasing approximately 24,100 sites at 81 resort Properties to Privileged Access or its subsidiaries so that Privileged Access may meet its obligations under the Agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 we recognized approximately $20.5 million and $17.8 million, respectively, in rent from these leasing arrangements. The lease income is included in Income from other investments, net in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations.        The Company has recently evaluated a possible purchase of Privileged Access and/or its subsidiaries. However, there continues to be lack of definitive guidance regarding the tax treatment of gross income from membership contracts for REIT gross income test purposes. As a result, the Company believes that the best strategic option available at this time was to bring Mr. McAdams to the Company and continue to work with Privileged Access on initiatives such as fractional sales, whole ownership and potentially combining certain overhead functions while maintaining the landlord  tenant relationship.        Effective January 1, 2008, the leases for these Properties were amended and restated and provide for the following significant terms: a) annual fixed rent of approximately $25.5 million, b) annual rent increases at the higher of CPI or a renegotiated amount based upon the fair market value of the Properties, c) expiration date of January 15, 2020, and d) two 5-year extension terms at the option of Privileged Access. The January 1, 2008 lease for 59 of the Properties known as the TT Portfolio also included provisions where the Company paid Privileged Access $1 million for entering into the amended lease. The $1 million payment will be amortized on a pro-rata basis over the remaining term of the lease as an offset to the annual lease payments. Additionally, the Company also agreed to reimburse Privileged Access up to $5 million for the cost of any improvements made to the TT Portfolio. The Company shall reimburse Privileged Access only if the improvement has been pre-approved, is a depreciable fixed asset and supporting documentation is provided. The assets purchased with the capital improvement fund will be the assets of the Company and will be amortized in accordance with the Companys depreciation policies.        The Company has subordinated its lease payment for the TT Portfolio to a bank that has loaned Privileged Access $10 million. The Company guaranteed $2.5 million of that loan in September 2007 and that guarantee was extinguished in December 2007. Privileged Access is obligated to pay back $5 million of the loan in 2008, $2.5 million in 2009 and the final $2.5 million in 2010. The Company believes that the possibility that Privileged Access would not make its lease payment on the TT Portfolio as a result of the subordination is remote.        Since June 12, 2006, Privileged Access has leased 130 cottage sites at Tropical Palms, a resort Property located near Orlando, Florida from the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 we earned approximately $1.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in rent from this leasing arrangement. The lease income is included in the Resort base rental income in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Tropical Palms lease currently provides for the following significant terms: a) annual fixed rent of approximately $1.4 million, paid quarterly, b) percentage rent of 50% of the tenants gross revenues in excess of the fixed rent, and c) expiration date of June 30, 2008. The Company expects to extend the Tropical Palms lease when it expires.        Refer to Note 12  Transactions with Related Parties included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a description of all agreements between the Company and Privileged Access.   Supplemental Property Disclosure          We provide the following disclosures with respect to certain assets:                       Monte Vista   Monte Vista is a lifestyle-oriented resort Property located in Mesa, Arizona containing approximately 56 acres of vacant land. We have obtained approval to develop 275 manufactured home and 240 resort sites on this land. In connection with evaluating the development of Monte Vista, we evaluated selling the land and subsequently decided to list 26 acres of the land for sale. With respect to the land not listed for sale, we intend to develop additional resort sites and may consider other alternative uses for the land or sale of the acreage.                           Bulow Plantation   Bulow Plantation is a 628-site mixed lifestyle-oriented resort and manufactured home Property located in Flagler Beach, Florida, which contains approximately 180 acres of adjacent vacant land. We have obtained approval from Flagler County for an additional manufactured home community development of approximately 700       33                                sites on this land. In connection with evaluating the possible development and based on inquiries from single-family home developers, we evaluated a sale of the land. Subsequently, we listed the land for sale for a purchase price of $28 million. We anticipate that we will proceed with the development if we determine that any offers or the terms thereof are unacceptable. ELS recently obtained an amendment to the Board of Flagler County Commissioners resolution approving the planned unit development classification of the Property to clarify that resort cottages may be installed and set forth standards for the installation of resort cottages. This amendment may impact the plans for the future development.                           Holiday Village, Florida   Holiday Village is a 128-site manufactured home community located in Vero Beach, Florida, on approximately 20 acres of land. As a result of the 2004 hurricanes, this Property is less than 50% occupied. The residents have been notified that the Property was listed for sale for a purchase price of $6 million.       Insurance          Approximately 70 Florida Properties suffered damage from the four hurricanes that struck the state during August and September 2004. As of February 19, 2008, the Company estimates its total claim to be $21.8 million, of which approximately $21.5 million of claims, including business interruption, have been submitted to its insurance companies for reimbursement. Through December 31, 2007, the Company has made total expenditures of approximately $17.4 million and expects to incur additional expenditures to complete the work necessary to restore the Properties to their pre-hurricanes condition. The Company has reserved approximately $2.0 million related to these expenditures ($0.7 million in 2005 and $1.3 million in 2004). Approximately $6.8 million of these expenditures have been capitalized per the Companys capitalization policy through December 31, 2007.        The Company has received proceeds from insurance carriers of approximately $7.9 million through December 31, 2007. The proceeds were accounted for in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5). Approximately $0.6 million has been recognized as a gain on insurance recovery, which is net of approximately $0.2 million of legal fees and included in income from other investments, net, as of December 31, 2007. The receivable from insurance providers included in other assets of approximately $1.5 million as of December 31, 2006, was collected in full during 2007.    34              Property Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Dispositions          The following chart lists the Properties or portfolios acquired, invested in, or sold since January 1, 2006:                                             Property         Transaction Date         Sites         Total Sites as of January 1, 2006                        106,337                                                Property or Portfolio (# of Properties in parentheses):                                    Thousand Trails (2)         April 14, 2006              624           Mid-Atlantic Portfolio (7)         April 25, 2006              1,594           Tranquil Timbers (1)         June 13, 2006              270           Outdoor World Portfolio (15)         December 15, 2006              3,962           Pine Island RV Resort (1)         August 3, 2007              363           Santa Cruz Ranch RV (1)         September 26, 2007              106           Tuxbury Pond RV Resort (1)         October 11, 2007              305                                                Joint Ventures:                                    Morgan Portfolio (5)         Various, 2006              1,134                                                Expansion Site Development and other:                                    Sites added (reconfigured) in 2006                        134           Sites added (reconfigured) in 2007                        75                                                Dispositions:                                    Indian Wells (Joint Venture) (1)         April 18, 2006              (350    )       Forest Oaks (1)         April 25, 2006              (227    )      Windsong (1)         April 25, 2006              (268    )      Blazing Star (Joint Venture) (1)         June 29, 2006              (254    )      Lazy Lakes (1)         January 10, 2007              (100    )      Del Rey (1)         July 6, 2007              (407    )      Holiday Village-Iowa (1)         November 30, 2007              (519    )                                           Total Sites as of December 31, 2007                        112,779                                                       Since December 31, 2005, the gross investment in real estate increased from $2,153 million to $2,396 million as of December 31, 2007, due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period.   Markets          The following table identifies our five largest markets by number of sites and provides information regarding our Properties (excludes membership campground Properties leased to Privileged Access and Properties owned through Joint Ventures).                                                                                                                                                                     Percent of Total      Major         Number of                             Percent of         Property Operating      Market         Properties         Total Sites         Total Sites         Revenues         Florida              81                   35,182                   42.7    %              43.8    %      Arizona              32                   12,375                   15.0    %              12.6    %      California              31                   7,333                   8.9    %              17.1    %      Texas              8                   5,143                   6.2    %              2.3    %      Colorado              10                   3,452                   4.2    %              4.9    %      Other              53                   18,930                   23.0    %              19.3    %                                                                                             Total              215                   82,415                   100.0    %              100.0    %                                                                                                     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates         Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.   35            Long-Lived Assets          In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141) ,  we allocate the purchase price of Properties we acquire to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective Property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each Property as a result of our due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.        We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.        Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We use a 30-year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life.   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts          Rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue and is recognized over the term of the respective lease or the length of a customers stay, the majority of which are for a term of not greater than one year. We monitor the collectibility of accounts receivable from our tenants on an ongoing basis. We will reserve for receivables when we believe the ultimate collection is less than probable and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded during each period and the associated bad debt expense is included in our property operating and maintenance expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allowance for doubtful accounts is netted against rents receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. Our provision for uncollectible rents receivable was approximately $1.2 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.        We may also finance the sale of homes to our customers through loans (referred to as Chattel Loans). The valuation of an allowance for doubtful accounts for the Chattel Loans is calculated based on a comparison of the outstanding principal balance of each note compared to the N.A.D.A. (National Automobile Dealers Association) value and the current market value of the underlying manufactured home collateral. A bad debt expense is recorded in home selling expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allowance for doubtful accounts is netted against the notes receivables on our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for these Chattel Loans as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was $160,000 and $110,000, respectively.   Inventory         Inventory consists of new and used Site Set homes and is stated at the lower of cost or market after consideration of the N.A.D.A. Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide and the current market value of each home included in the home inventory. Inventory sales revenues and resale revenues are recognized when the home sale is closed. Inventory is recorded net of an inventory reserve as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 of $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The expense for the inventory reserve is included in the cost of home sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.   Variable Interest Entities          In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R)  an interpretation of ARB 51. The objective of FIN 46R is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity (VIE) and determine when the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and results of operations of a VIE need to be included in a companys consolidated financial statements. A company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate such entity if the company absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses or receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns if they occur, or both (i.e., the primary beneficiary). The Company will apply FIN 46R to all types of entity ownership (general and limited partnerships and corporate interests).        The Company will re-evaluate and apply the provisions of FIN 46R to existing entities if certain events occur which warrant re-evaluation of such entities. In addition, the Company will apply the provisions of FIN 46R to all new entities in the future. The Company also consolidates entities in which it has a controlling direct or indirect voting interest. The equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which the Company does not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest,   36              but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions. The cost method is applied when (i) the investment is minimal (typically less than 5%) and (ii) the Companys investment is passive.        Effective January 1, 2008, the 100 percent owner of Privileged Access, Mr. Joe McAdams, became our President and we amended and restated the leases for the 81 Properties. Under generally accepted accounting principles, effective January 1, 2008, Mr. McAdams, Privileged Access and the Company are considered related parties. Due to the materiality of the leasing arrangement and the related party nature of the arrangement, the Company has analyzed whether the operations of Privileged Access should be consolidated with ours. We have determined under FIN 46 that it would not be appropriate to consolidate Privileged Access as we do not control Privileged Access and are not the primary beneficiary of Privileged Access. This conclusion required management to make complex judgments. As a result of the complex nature of the arrangements, on February 15, 2008, we submitted a letter to the Office of the Chief Accountant at the SEC describing the relationship and asking for the SECs concurrence with our conclusions that we should not consolidate the operations of Privileged Access. As of the date of filing this Form 10-K, we do not a response from the SEC.   Valuation of Financial Instruments          The valuation of financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments (SFAS No. 107) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Where possible, we base the fair values of our financial instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, we base our estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instrument.   Stock-Based Compensation          The Company adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure .  The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) (SFAS 123(R)), Share Based Payment on July 1, 2005, which did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees, consultants and directors.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements          We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with any unconsolidated investments or joint ventures that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements          In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160), an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. The Statement seeks to improve uniformity and transparency in reporting of the net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements of the reporting entity. The statement requires, among other provisions, the disclosure, clear labeling and presentation of non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement. SFAS No. 160 is effective January 1, 2009 with early adoption prohibited. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have a material effect on the financial position of the Company.        In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141R, Business Combinations, (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R replaces FASB Statement No. 141 but retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (also known as the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. SFAS No. 141R also establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; (b) improves the completeness of the information reported about a business combination by changing the requirements for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies; (c) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (d) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R replaces, with limited exceptions as specified in the Statement, the cost allocation process in SFAS No. 141with a fair value based allocation process. SFAS No. 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning   37              on or after December 15, 2008. Early application is not permitted. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 141R will have on its consolidated financial statements.        In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Companies are not allowed to adopt SFAS No. 159 on a retrospective basis unless they choose early adoption. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 is optional and the Company plans to evaluate the potential adoption in 2008.        In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material effect on its financial statements.        In June 2006, FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48), to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. As required, the Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have any significant impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations.

Total Portfolio operating revenues increased due to site rental rate increases and our 2006 and 2007 acquisitions (see Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).   38            Results of Operations (continued)     Property Operating Expenses          The 5.2% increase in property operating expenses for the Core Portfolio reflects a 5.7% increase in property operating and maintenance due primarily to increases in utilities, repair and maintenance, payroll and insurance expenses. The increase in real estate taxes is in the Core Portfolio is generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues. Total Portfolio operating expenses increased due to our 2006 and 2007 acquisitions, as well as increases in utilities and legal expenses. Property management expense for the Total Portfolio increased primarily due to 2006 and 2007 acquisitions and payroll increases.

The decrease in home selling expenses is primarily due to lower sales volumes and decreased advertising costs. The decrease in ancillary service revenue relates primarily to an increase in community activity expenses and store expenses.

Rent control initiatives increased primarily as a result of activity regarding the Contempo Marin and City of Santee trials (see Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).        Depreciation on real estate increased $3.3 million primarily relating to acquisitions.   Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures          For the year ended December 31, 2007, equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $0.9 million primarily due to the distributions received from three joint ventures relating to debt financings by the joint ventures. These distributions exceeded the Companys basis and were included in income from unconsolidated joint ventures. This was offset by the purchase of the remaining interest in Mezzanine Properties and the gain on sale of the property owned by Indian Wells joint venture in 2006.   Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2006 to Year Ended December 31, 2005          The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Property Operations for all Properties owned throughout both periods (Core Portfolio) and the Total Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands).                                                                                                                                                                                         Core Portfolio              Total Portfolio                                                             Increase /              %                                                      Increase /              %                     2006              2005              (Decrease)              Change              2006              2005              (Decrease)              Change              Community base rental income         $    222,767              $    213,280              $    9,487                   4.4    %         $    225,815              $    213,280              $    12,535                   5.9    %      Resort base rental income              74,063                   71,015                   3,048                   4.3    %              89,925                   74,371                   15,554                   20.9    %      Utility and other income              28,831                   27,202                   1,629                   6.0    %              30,643                   27,367                   3,276                   12.0    %                                                                                                                                     Property operating revenues              325,661                   311,497                   14,164                   4.5    %              346,383                   315,018                   31,365                   10.0    %                                                                                                                                                                             Property operating and maintenance              106,382                   102,158                   4,224                   4.1    %              116,179                   103,832                   12,347                   11.9    %      Real estate taxes              24,736                   24,490                   246                   1.0    %              26,246                   24,671                   1,575                   6.4    %      Property management              15,995                   15,392                   603                   3.9    %              17,079                   15,919                   1,160                   7.3    %                                                                                                                                     Property operating expenses              147,113                   142,040                   5,073                   3.6    %              159,504                   144,422                   15,082                   10.4    %                                                                                                                                     Income from property operations         $    178,548              $    169,457              $    9,091                   5.4    %         $    186,879              $    170,596              $    16,283                   9.5    %                                                                                                                                       Property Operating Revenues          The 4.5% increase in the Core Portfolio property operating revenues reflects (i) a 4.4% increase in rates for our community base rental income combined with a 0.1% increase in occupancy, (ii) a 4.3% increase in revenues for our core resort base income, and (iii) an increase in utility income and other fees primarily due to the pass-through of higher utility rates. Total Portfolio operating revenues increased due to site rental rate increases and our 2005 and 2006 acquisitions (see Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).   40            Results of Operations (continued)     Property Operating Expenses          The 3.6% increase in property operating expenses for the Core Portfolio reflects a 4.1% increase in property operating and maintenance due primarily to increases in utilities and repair and maintenance. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues. Total Portfolio operating expenses increased due to our 2005 and 2006 acquisitions, as well as increases in utilities and repair and maintenance. Property management expense for the Total Portfolio increased primarily due to 2005 and 2006 acquisitions and payroll increases.

Used home sales gross profit reflects higher gross margin per home and higher volumes. Brokered resale revenues reflect decreased resale volumes. The increase in home selling expenses relates primarily to advertising. The increase in ancillary service revenue relates primarily to our acquisitions.   Other Income and Expenses          The following table summarizes other income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands).                                                                                                         2006              2005              Variance              % Change              Interest income         $    1,975              $    1,406              $    569                   40.5    %      Income from other investments, net              20,102                   16,609                   3,493                   21.0    %      General and administrative              (12,760    )              (13,624    )              864                   6.3    %      Rent control initiatives              (1,157    )              (1,081    )              (76    )              (7.0    %)      Interest and related amortization              (103,161    )              (100,712    )              (2,449    )              (2.4    %)      Loss on early debt retirement                                 (20,630    )              20,630                   100.0    %      Depreciation on corporate assets              (410    )              (804    )              394                   49.0    %      Depreciation on real estate assets              (60,276    )              (55,608    )              (4,668    )              (8.4    %)                                                                         Total other expenses, net         $    (155,687    )         $    (174,444    )         $    18,757                   10.8    %                                                                           41             Results of Operations (continued)          Interest income increased due to interest earned on our Privileged Access note as discussed above.        Income from other investments, net increased due to: the previously discussed increase in ground lease activity with Privileged Access, corporate expense savings of $0.9 million, one-time gains including a $1.0 million non-refundable deposit received upon termination of the contract for the sale of Del Rey and a $0.9 million gain on sale of our preferred partnership interest in College Heights, was previously classified as other assets. These increases were offset by a write-off of costs related to potential transactions no longer being considered of $0.9 million.        General and administrative expense decreased due to decreased legal costs and banking fees, partially offset by an increase in payroll. Interest and related amortization increased due to acquisitions offset by a decrease in our average interest rates due to refinancings in 2005.        Loss on early debt retirement decreased due to transaction costs on early debt retirement related to refinancings in 2005.        Depreciation on corporate assets decreased as a result of assets being fully depreciated. Depreciation on real estate increased $4.7 million primarily relating to acquisitions.   Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures          For the year ended December 31, 2006, equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $2.9 million primarily due to the purchase of the remaining interest in the Mezzanine Properties in the first quarter of 2006 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources  Investing Activities), as well as distributions received in 2005 from three joint ventures relating to debt refinancings by the ventures. Two of these distributions exceeded the Companys basis and therefore were included in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in 2005. These decreases are partially offset by the net gain on sale of the property owned by the Indian Wells joint venture.   Liquidity and Capital Resources     Liquidity          As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $5.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $267 million available on its lines of credit. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing lines of credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under its existing lines of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to net cash provided by operating activities. The Company has approximately $200 million of scheduled debt maturities in 2008. The Company is currently evaluating refinancing options and expects to be able to satisfy the maturing debt with some combination of refinancing proceeds, net cash provided by operating activities and/or its available lines of credit. The table below summarizes cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands).                                                                                     For the twelve months ended                     December 31,                     2007              2006              2005              Cash provided by operating activities         $    122,791              $    99,457              $    90,326           Cash used in investing activities              (25,604    )              (67,086    )              (66,246    )      Cash used in financing activities              (93,007    )              (31,376    )              (28,775    )                                                             Net increase (decrease) in cash         $    4,180              $    995              $    (4,695    )                                                            Operating Activities          Net cash provided by operating activities increased $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. As discussed in Results of Operations above, this increase reflects increases in property operating income and income from other investments, net, offset by an increase in depreciation expense, general and   42            Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)    administrative expense and a decrease in home sales. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $90.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase reflects increases in property operating income and income from other investments, net, offset by an increase in interest expense and a decrease in home sales as discussed in Results of Operations above.    Investing Activities          Net cash used in investing activities reflects the impact of the following investing activities:   Acquisitions     During the year ended December 31, 2007, we completed the following transactions:                        On January 29, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 75% interest in a joint venture Property known as Mesa Verde, which is a 345-site resort Property on approximately 28 acres in Yuma, Arizona. The gross purchase price was approximately $5.9 million. We assumed a first mortgage loan of approximately $3.5 million with an interest rate of 4.94% per annum, maturing in 2008. The remainder of the acquisition price of approximately $1.8 million was funded with a withdrawal from the tax-deferred exchange account established as a result of the disposition of Lazy Lakes, discussed below.                           On June 27, 2007, the Company purchased the remaining 75% interest in a Diversified Investments joint venture Property known as Winter Garden, which is a 350-site resort Property on approximately 27 acres in Winter Garden, Florida. The gross purchase price was approximately $10.9 million, and we assumed a second mortgage loan of approximately $4.0 million with an interest rate of 4.3% per annum, maturing in September 2008. The remainder of the acquisition price, net of a credit for our existing 25% interest, was funded with proceeds from the Companys lines of credit and a withdrawal of approximately $3.7 million from the tax-deferred exchange account established as a result of the disposition of Lazy Lakes discussed below.                           On August 3, 2007, the Company acquired a 363-site resort Property known as Pine Island, on approximately 31 acres, located near St. James City, Florida. The purchase price of approximately $6.5 million was funded with a withdrawal from the tax-deferred exchange account established as a result of the sale of Del Rey discussed below.                           On September 26, 2007, the Company acquired a 106-site resort Property known as Santa Cruz RV Ranch, on approximately 7 acres, located near Scotts Valley, California. The purchase price was approximately $5.5 million.                           On October 11, 2007, we acquired a 305-site resort property known as Tuxbury Resort, on approximately 193 acres in Amesbury, Massachusetts, including approximately 100 acres of potential expansion land. The purchase price was approximately $7.3 million and the seller provided financing of approximately $1.2 million that matures in January 2010. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with a withdrawal from the tax-deferred exchange account established as a result of the sale of Del Rey discussed below.            Certain purchase price adjustments may be made within one year following the acquisitions.   2006 Acquisitions          During the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired 40 Properties (see Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K). The combined investment in real estate for these 40 Properties was approximately $162.6 million and was funded with the exchange of two all age properties, new financing of $47.1 million, debt assumed of $38.7 million, and borrowings from our lines of credit. We assumed rents received in advance of approximately $5.0 million, inventory of approximately $1.9 million, escrow deposits of $0.6 million, and other net payables of $0.4 million.   2005 Acquisitions          During the year ended December 31, 2005, we acquired seven Properties (see Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K). The combined real estate investment in these Properties was approximately $89.9   43           Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)    million and was funded with money drawn from our lines of credit and debt assumed of $53.5 million. We also assumed approximately $5.4 million in escrow deposits and $4.0 million of rents received in advance as a result of these acquisitions.      Dispositions          On January 10, 2007, we sold Lazy Lakes, a 100-site resort Property in the Florida Keys, for proceeds of approximately $7.7 million. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $4.6 million. In order to defer the taxable gain on the sale of Lazy Lakes, the sales proceeds, net of an eligible distribution of $2.4 million, were deposited in a tax-deferred exchange account. The funds in the exchange account were used in the Mesa Verde and Winter Garden acquisitions discussed above.        On July 6, 2007, we sold Del Rey, a 407 site manufactured home site Property in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for proceeds of approximately $13.0 million. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $6.9 million. These proceeds were deposited in a tax-deferred exchange account pending future like-kind exchange acquisitions. Funds were subsequently used for the acquisitions of Pine Island and Tuxbury Resort, discussed above.        On November 30, 2007, we sold Holiday Village, a 519-site all-age manufactured home Property in Sioux City, Iowa for $3.0 million. The sales price included approximately $0.4 million in proceeds from the sale of inventory homes to the buyer. The Company recognized a gain of sale of approximately $0.6 million. The proceeds from the sale were deposited in a tax-deferred exchange account pending future like-kind acquisitions, which is classified as escrow deposits and other in the balance sheet.        During the year ended December 31, 2006, we exchanged two Properties located in Indiana as part of the Mid-Atlantic Portfolio acquisition (see Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K). We recorded a loss on sale for this transaction of $0.2 million.        During the year ended December 31, 2005, we sold one Property located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa for a selling price of $6.7 million. Net proceeds of $6.3 million were used to repay amounts outstanding on our lines of credit. A gain on sale of approximately $2.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2005.        We currently have two all-age Properties held for disposition and are in various stages of negotiations for sale. We plan to reinvest the sale proceeds or reduce outstanding lines of credit.        The operating results of all properties sold or held for disposition have been reflected in the discontinued operations of the Consolidated Statements of Operations contained in this Form 10-K.   Notes Receivable Activity          As of December 31, 2006, we had a note receivable from Privileged Access of approximately $12.3 million, which was repaid in full during 2007. The remaining notes receivable activity of $1.2 million in cash outflow reflects net lending from our Chattel Loans.   Investments in and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures          During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company invested approximately $2.7 million in developing one of the Bar Harbor joint venture Properties, which resulted in an increase of the Companys ownership interest per the joint venture agreement. As of December 31, 2007, the Bar Harbor joint venture has been consolidated with the operations of the Company as the Company has determined that as of December 31, 2007 we are the primary beneficiary by applying the standards of FIN 46R. This consolidation has decreased the Companys investment in joint venture approximately $11.1 million, with an offsetting increase in investment in real estate.        During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company received approximately $5.2 million in distributions from our joint ventures. $5.1 million of these distributions were classified as return on capital and were included in operating activities. The remaining distributions of approximately $0.1 million were classified as a return of capital and were included in investing activities and were related to refinancings at three of our joint venture Properties. Approximately $2.5 million of the distributions received exceeded the Companys basis in its joint venture and as such were recorded in income from unconsolidated joint ventures.        During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company invested approximately $1.1 million in five joint ventures owning five Properties located in Florida, Massachusetts, Maine and two in Virginia. The Company also invested approximately $1.6   44           Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)     million in developing one of the Bar Harbor joint venture Properties, which resulted in an increase of the Companys ownership interest per the joint venture agreement.           During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company received approximately $5.1 million in distributions from our joint ventures. $3.5 million of these distributions were classified as return on capital and were included in operating activities. The remaining distributions of approximately $1.6 million were classified as a return of capital and were included in investing activities and related to our sale of the Property owned by the Indian Wells joint venture and the sale of our interest in the Blazing Star joint venture.        During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company invested approximately $7.0 million for a 50% preferred joint venture interest in three Properties located near Bar Harbor, Maine. The Company also invested approximately $0.6 million for a 40% interest in a Texas Property owned by a joint venture controlled by Diversified Investments, Inc (Diversified).        During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company received approximately $11.3 million in distributions from our joint ventures. $5.8 million of these distributions were classified as return on capital and were included in operating activities. The remaining distributions of approximately $5.5 million were classified as a return of capital, were included in investing activities, and related to refinancings at three of our joint venture Properties.        In addition, the Company recorded approximately $2.7 million, $3.6 million and $6.5 million of net income from joint ventures, net of $1.4 million, $1.9 million and $2.0 million of depreciation, in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.        Due to the Companys inability to control the joint ventures, the Company accounts for its investment in the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.   Proceeds from sale of investment          During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company sold its preferred partnership interest in College Heights for approximately $9.0 million. At the time of the sale, College Heights owned a portfolio of 11 Properties with approximately 1,900 sites located in Michigan, Ohio and Florida. The proceeds received represent a per site value of approximately $22,000.   Capital improvements          Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as recurring capital expenditures (Recurring CapEx), site development costs and corporate costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $16.0 million, $14.6 million and $15.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Included in Recurring CapEx for the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005 is approximately $1.5 million, $2.0 million and $3.4 million of costs incurred to replace hurricane damaged assets. Site development costs were approximately $12.8 million, $17.3 million and $16.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Companys Properties and costs for improvements to sites when a smaller used home is replaced with a larger new home. Reduction in site development costs is due to the decrease in new homes sales volume. Corporate costs such as computer hardware, office furniture and office improvements and expansion were $0.6 million, $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   Financing Activities          Net cash used in financing activities reflects the impact of the following:   Mortgages and Credit Facilities     Financing, Refinancing and Early Debt Retirement     2007 Activity          During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company completed the following transactions:                       The Company repaid approximately $1.9 million of mortgage debt in connection with the sale of Lazy Lakes.       45           Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)                         In connection with the acquisition of Mesa Verde, during the first quarter of 2007, the Company assumed $3.5 million in mortgage debt bearing interest at 4.94% per annum and maturing in May 2008.                             In connection with the acquisition of Winter Garden, during the second quarter of 2007, the Company assumed $4.0 million in mortgage debt bearing interest at 4.3% per annum and maturing in September 2008.                           During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, the Company repaid the outstanding mortgage indebtedness on Ft. Myers Beach RV Resort of approximately $2.9 million.                           In September 2007, we amended our existing unsecured Lines of Credit (LOC) to expand our borrowing capacity from $275 million to $420 million. The lines of credit continue to accrue interest at LIBOR plus a maximum of 1.20% per annum, have a 0.15% facility fee, mature on June 30, 2010, and have a one-year extension option. Our current group of banks have committed up to $370 million on our $420 million borrowing capacity. We incurred commitment and arrangement fees of approximately $0.3 million to increase our borrowing capacity.                           During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, the Company paid off a $6.5 million mortgage that matured on Park City West RV Resort.                           The Company paid down $7.7 million of the mortgage debt on Tropical Palms RV Resort during the quarter ended December 31, 2007. The Tropical Palms RV Resort mortgage debt balance as of December 31, 2007 is approximately $12 million and matures in December 2008.       2006 Activity          During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company completed the following transactions:                       Assumed $25.9 million in mortgage debt on four of the eleven Properties related to the acquisition of the Mezzanine Portfolio. During the second and third quarters of 2006, this mortgage debt was defeased. Net proceeds of approximately $10.4 million were used to pay down the lines of credit. The four mortgages bear interest at weighted average interest rates ranging from 5.69% to 6.143% per annum and mature in 2016. In addition, we financed $47.1 million of mortgage debt to acquire the remaining seven Properties in the Mezzanine Portfolio. The seven mortgages bear interest at weighted average rates ranging from 5.70% to 5.72% per annum, and mature in April 2016.                           Received $3.0 million and $2.9 million in mortgage debt proceeds as a result of meeting certain operational criteria at the Monte Vista Property and the Viewpoint Property, respectively. These proceeds were used to pay down the lines of credit.                           Renewed our unsecured debt. We replaced the term loan which had a remaining balance of $100 million maturing in 2007, and a $110 million line of credit maturing in August 2006 with a $225 million line of credit with a four-year maturity and one-year extension option. The new facility bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.20% per annum with a 0.15% facility fee per annum. The interest rate on the term loan was LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum and the $110 million line of credit had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.65% and had a 0.15% unused fee, both per annum. The interest rate on $75 million of the outstanding balance on the new line of credit is fixed at 6.38% per annum through mid-December 2007. We also renewed our $50 million line of credit which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.20% per annum with a 0.20% facility fee per annum, and matures on June 29, 2010. The renewal increases our financial flexibility and lowers our credit spread.                           Acquired for $2.4 million land formerly subject to a ground lease previously classified as mortgage debt relating to the Golden Terrace South Property.                           Assumed $12.8 million in mortgage debt in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interests in four Diversified Properties. The four mortgages have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.5% per annum and a weighted average maturity of three years.          46           Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)     2005 Activity            During the third quarter of 2005, the Company refinanced two mortgage loans for proceeds of $34 million at an interest rate of 4.95% per annum. Net proceeds were used to pay down approximately $20 million in other secured financing maturing in 2006.          On December 2, 2005, the Company refinanced approximately $293 million of secured debt maturing in 2007 with an effective interest rate of 6.8% per annum. This debt was secured by two cross-collateralized loan pools consisting of 35 Properties. The transaction generated approximately $337 million in proceeds from loans secured by individual mortgages on 20 Properties. The blended interest rate on the refinancing was approximately 5.3% per annum and the loans mature in 2015. Transaction costs were approximately $20.0 million ($0.67 per fully diluted share) and are classified as loss on early debt retirement on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining excess proceeds were used to repay outstanding amounts on our lines of credit. This transaction strengthened the Companys balance sheet by extending the weighted average years to maturity by approximately two years.        During the third quarter of 2005, in connection with its acquisitions, the Company assumed mortgage debt of approximately $53.5 million at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.9% per annum.   Secured Debt          As of December 31, 2007, our secured long-term debt balance was approximately $1.6 billion, with a weighted average interest rate in 2007 of approximately 5.9% per annum. The debt bears interest at rates between 4.3% and 10.0% per annum and matures on various dates mainly ranging from 2008 to 2016. Included in our debt balance are three capital leases with an imputed interest rate of 13.1% per annum. We have approximately $200 million of long-term debt maturing in 2008 and approximately $80 million in 2009. The weighted average term to maturity for the long-term debt is approximately 5.5 years.   Unsecured Debt          We have two unsecured lines of credit with maximum borrowing capacity of $350 million and $20 million which bear interest at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a maximum of 1.20% per annum, have a 0.15% facility fee, mature on June 30, 2010, and have a one-year extension option. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2007, we borrowed $126.2 million and paid down $154.5 million on our lines of credit. The weighted average interest rate in 2007 for our unsecured debt was approximately 6.8% per annum. The balance outstanding as of December 31, 2007 was $103 million. As of February 22, 2008, approximately $281.7 million is available to be drawn on these combined lines of credit.   Other Loans          During 2007, we borrowed $4.3 million to finance our insurance premium payments.

As of December 31, 2006, $0.3 million remained outstanding. This loan was paid off in January 2007 and beared interest at 5.30% per annum.        Certain of the Companys mortgages and credit agreements contain covenants and restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured debt versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed charges-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), limitations on certain holdings and other restrictions.   Contractual Obligations          As of December 31, 2007, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below (dollars in thousands):                                                                                                                                                           Contractual                                                                            Obligations         Total         2008(2)         2009         2010(3)         2011         2013         Thereafter         Long Term Borrowings (1)         $    1,656,924              $    212,134              $    85,807              $    336,232              $    65,081              $    18,076              $    939,594           Weighted average interest rates              6.13    %              5.72    %              7.00    %              7.12    %              7.07    %              5.93    %              5.75    %                               (1)         Balance excludes net premiums and discounts of $2.5 million.       47             Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)                      (2)         The Company is currently evaluating refinancing options and expects to be able to satisfy the maturing debt with some combination of refinancing proceeds, net cash provided by operating activities and/or its available lines of credit.           (3)         Includes lines of credit repayments in 2010 of $103 million. We have an option to extend this maturity for one year to 2011.             Included in the above table are certain capital lease obligations totaling approximately $6.6 million. These agreements expire June 2009 and are paid semi-annually at an imputed interest rate of 13.1% per annum.          The Company does not include preferred OP Unit distributions, interest expense, insurance, property taxes and cancelable contracts in the contractual obligations table above.        The Company leases land under non-cancelable operating leases at certain of the Properties expiring in various years from 2022 to 2054, with terms which require twelve equal payments per year plus additional rents calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, ground lease rent was approximately $1.6 million. Minimum future rental payments under the ground leases are approximately $1.8 million for each of the next five years and approximately $20.8 million thereafter.        With respect to maturing debt, the Company has staggered the maturities of its long-term mortgage debt over an average of approximately 6 years, with no more than $600 million in principal maturities coming due in any single year. The Company believes that it will be able to refinance its maturing debt obligations on a secured or unsecured basis; however, to the extent the Company is unable to refinance its debt as it matures, it believes that it will be able to repay such maturing debt from asset sales and/or the proceeds from equity issuances. With respect to any refinancing of maturing debt, the Companys future cash flow requirements could be impacted by significant changes in interest rates or other debt terms, including required amortization payments.   Equity Transactions          In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute 90% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) to its stockholders. The following regular quarterly distributions have been declared and paid to common stockholders and minority interests since January 1, 2005.                                                                             Distribution                                    Amount Per         For the Quarter         Stockholder                Share         Ending         Record Date         Payment Date         $0.0250         March 31, 2005         March 25, 2005         April 8, 2005      $0.0250         June 30, 2005         June 24, 2005         July 8, 2005      $0.0250         September 30, 2005         September 30, 2005         October 14, 2005      $0.0250         December 31, 2005         December 30, 2005         January 13, 2006             $0.0750         March 31, 2006         March 31, 2006         April 14, 2006      $0.0750         June 30, 2006         June 30, 2006         July 14, 2006      $0.0750         September 30, 2006         September 29, 2006         October 13, 2006      $0.0750         December 31, 2006         December 29, 2006         January 12, 2007             $0.1500         March 31, 2007         March 30, 2007         April 13, 2007      $0.1500         June 30, 2007         June 29, 2007         July 13, 2007      $0.1500         September 30, 2007         September 28, 2007         October 12, 2007      $0.1500         December 31, 2007         December 28, 2007         January 11, 2008        2007 Activity          On November 13, 2007, the Company announced that in 2008 the annual distribution per common share will be $0.80 per share up from $0.60 per share in 2007 and $0.30 per share in 2006. This decision recognizes the Companys investment opportunities and the importance of its dividend to its stockholders.        On December 28, 2007, September 28, 2007, June 29, 2007 and March 30, 2007, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 8.0625% per annum on the $150 million Series D 8% Units and 7.95% per annum on the $50 million of Series F 7.95% Units.        During the year ended December 31, 2007, we received approximately $3.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock through stock option exercises and the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).    48           Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)    2006 Activity            On December 29, 2006, September 29, 2006, June 30, 2006 and March 31, 2006, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 8.0625% per annum on the $150 million of Series D 8% Units and 7.95% per annum on the $50 million of Series F 7.95% Units.        During the year ended December 31, 2006, we received approximately $3.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock through stock option exercises and the ESPP.   2005 Activity          On March 24, 2005, the Operating Partnership issued $25 million of 8.0625% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Units (the Series D 8% Units), to institutional investors. The Series D 8% Units are non-callable for five years. In addition, the Operating Partnership had an existing $125 million of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Units (the Series D 9% Units) outstanding that were callable by the Company as of September 2004. In connection with the new issue, the Operating Partnership agreed to extend the non-call provision of the Series D 9% Units to be coterminous with the new issue, and the institutional investors holding the Series D 9% Units agreed to lower the rate on such units to 8.0625%. All of the units have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit.        On June 30, 2005, the Operating Partnership issued $50 million of 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Units (the Series F Units), to institutional investors. The Series F Units are non-callable for five years and have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit.        On March 24, 2005, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 9.0% per annum on the $125 million of Series D 9% Units. For the seven days ended March 31, 2005 and the nine months thereafter, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 8.0625% per annum on the $150 million of Series D 8% Units. For the six months ended December 31, 2005, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 7.95% per annum on the $50 million of Series F Units. Distributions on the Units were paid quarterly on the last calendar day of each quarter.        During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received approximately $4.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock through stock option exercises and the ESPP.   Inflation          Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation to the Company. In addition, our resort Properties are not generally subject to leases and rents are established for these sites on an annual basis.   49               Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)     Funds From Operations          Funds from Operations (FFO) is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe FFO, as defined by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be an appropriate measure of performance for an equity REIT. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity REITs, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance.        FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of Properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. We further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income and cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, when evaluating an equity REITs operating performance. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.         The following table presents a calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands):                                                                                     2007              2006              2005              Computation of funds from operations:                                                                  Net income (loss) available for Common Shares         $    32,102              $    16,632              $    (2,333    )      Income (loss) allocated to Common OP Units              7,705                   4,318                   (539    )      Depreciation on real estate assets              63,554                   60,276                   55,608           Depreciation expense included in discontinued operations                                 84                    410           Depreciation expense included in equity in income from joint ventures              1,427                   1,909                   1,960           Gain on sale of Properties              (12,036    )              (852    )              (2,279    )                                                          Funds from operations available for Common Shares         $    92,752              $    82,367              $    52,827                                                                                                                                  Weighted average Common Shares outstanding  fully diluted              30,414                   30,241                   29,927                                                                 50               Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk          Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates. The primary market risk we face is long-term indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our long-term debt obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2007, approximately 93% or approximately $1.5 billion of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates, which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures. For each increase in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately $82.7 million. For each decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total outstanding debt would increase by approximately $87.4 million.        At December 31, 2007, approximately 7% or approximately $114.8 million of our outstanding debt was short-term and at variable rates. Earnings are affected by increases and decreases in market interest rates on this debt. For each increase/decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), our earnings would increase/decrease by approximately $1.1 million annually.
