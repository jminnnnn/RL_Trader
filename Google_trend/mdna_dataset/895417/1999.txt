RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997       Since December 31, 1997, the gross investment in rental property has increased from $936 million to $1,237 million as of December 31, 1998 due to the acquisition of the following properties (collectively, the "1998 Acquisition Properties"): (i) the Ellenburg Communities; (ii) Quail Meadows on January 8, 1998; (iii) Sherwood Forest RV Resort on April 30, 1998; (iv) Casa Del Sol Resort III on May 14, 1998; (v) a portfolio of eighteen properties (the "College Heights Communities") on June 4, 1998; and (vi) Sunset Oaks on August 13, 1998. The total number of sites owned and controlled has increased from 44,108 as of December 31, 1997 to 53,391 as of December 31, 1998.       The following table summarizes certain weighted average statistics for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.  "Core Portfolio" represents an analysis of properties owned during both periods of comparison.                                                       Core Portfolio                   Total Portfolio                                             -----------------------------      -------------------------                                                1998              1997             1998           1997                                             -----------       -----------      -----------    ----------                 Total sites                                27,455             27,432           43,932       29,323      Occupied sites                             26,057             25,983           41,420       27,770      Occupancy %                                  94.9%              94.7%            94.3%        94.7%      Monthly base rent per site                $   335            $   321          $   332      $   327        Base rental income ($165 million) increased $56.3 million or 51.7%. For the Core Portfolio, base rental income increased approximately $4.1 million or 4.1%, reflecting an increase in base rental rates. The remaining $52.2 million increase in base rental income was attributed to the properties acquired in 1997 and the 1998 Acquisition Properties (collectively, the "1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties").                                          18    19   Monthly base rent per site for the total portfolio increased 1.5%, reflecting a 4.4% increase in monthly base rent per site for the Core Portfolio offset by lower monthly base rents for the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties. Average monthly base rent per site for the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties was $329 for the year ended December 31, 1998.       Weighted average occupancy decreased 0.4% due to the addition of the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties to the portfolio with lower occupancy percentages, partially offset by increased occupancy at the Core Portfolio The 0.2% increase at the Core Portfolio reflects a 0.4% decrease attributed to lower occupancy at four family properties and lower occupancy at two properties where the Company has implemented a program to upgrade the resident profile and housing stock. Excluding these communities, occupancy at the Core Portfolio increased 0.6%.       Utility and other income ($25.4 million) increased $13.6 million or 115.3%, due to an increase of $13.1 million attributed to the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties,  including $7.2 million of RV income. The remaining $500,000 increase reflected increased  utility income, real estate tax pass-ons and other miscellaneous income at the Core Portfolio.       Interest income ($3.0 million) increased $1.1 million or 57.0%, primarily due to the issuance of $14.6 million of notes receivable and an increase in interest earned on short-term investments. Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 of approximately $6.9 million and $4.7 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 5.4% per annum in both years.       Property operating and maintenance expenses ($53.0 million) increased $20.7 million or 64.1%. Of this increase $19.4 million is attributed to the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties. The remaining $1.3 million increase includes approximately $300,000 of one-time expenses associated with water main breaks, storm damage and legal costs at the Core Portfolio. The Core Portfolio also experienced increases in property payroll, property general and administrative expenses and insurance and other expenses. Property operating and maintenance expenses represented 27.2% of total revenues in 1998 and 26.2% in 1997.       Real estate taxes ($14.5 million) increased $6.1 million or 73.3% due to the impact of the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties.  Real estate taxes represented 7.4% of total revenues in 1998 and 6.8% in 1997.       Property management expenses ($7.1 million) increased $2.0 million or 39.9%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in management company payroll and incremental costs associated with self management of the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties. Property management expenses represented 3.6% of total revenues in 1998 and 4.1% of total revenues in 1997.       General and Administrative expenses ("G&A") ($5.4 million) increased $851,000 or 18.7%.  The increase was primarily due to increased payroll.  G&A represented 2.8% of total revenues in 1998 and 3.7% in 1997.       Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") increased $41.6 million or 56.8%.  Approximately $37.6 million of the increase related to the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition  Properties.  The remaining increase reflected increased base rental income at the Core Portfolio.  EBITDA represented 58.9% of total revenues in 1998 and 59.2% in 1997.       Interest and related amortization ($49.7 million) increased $27.9 million or 128.4%. The increase was due to higher weighted average outstanding debt balances during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 were $696 million and $301.3 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.2% in 1998 and 7.1% in 1997. Interest and related amortization represented 25.5% of total revenues in 1998 and 17.6% in 1997.       The Company has a $265.0 million mortgage note (the "Mortgage Debt") collateralized by 29 properties beneficially owned by MHC Financing Limited Partnership. The Mortgage Debt has a maturity date of January 2, 2028 and pays interest only at 7.015%. There is no principal amortization until February 1, 2008 after which principal and interest are paid from available cash flow and the interest rate is reset at a rate equal to the then 10-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.0%.       The Company has an unsecured line of credit with a bank (the "Credit Agreement") bearing interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.125%. On April 28, 1998, the Company amended the Credit Agreement, increasing the line of credit from $100 million to $150 million. On December 18, 1998, the Company further amended the Credit Agreement, increasing the line of credit from $150 million to $175 million. The Credit Agreement matures on August 17, 2000, at which time the Company may extend the maturity date to August 17, 2002 and the Credit Agreement would be converted to a term loan. The Company pays a fee on the average unused amount of such credit equal to 0.15% of such amount. As of December 31, 1998, $145 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Company paid fees related to the amendments which were immaterial.                                          19    20        The Company has a term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of banks with interest only payable monthly at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%. On April 28, 1998, the Company amended the Term Loan to increase the borrowing from $60 million to $100 million. The Term Loan matures on April 3, 2000 and may be extended to April 3, 2002. The Company used the $40 million in proceeds to repay a portion of the $50 million previously borrowed on April 7, 1998 under the Term Loan. The Company paid fees related to this amendment which were immaterial.       In July 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at 6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only of legal costs which were deemed immaterial. The value of the 1998 Swap is impacted by changes in the market rate of interest. Had the 1998 Swap been entered into on December 31, 1998, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have been 4.56%. Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap rate for the 1998 Swap increases or decreases the value of the 1998 Swap versus its current value by approximately $39,000. The Company accounts for the 1998 Swap as a hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap are accounted for as an adjustment to interest expense.       Depreciation on corporate assets ($995,000)  increased $405,000 or 68.8% due to fixed asset additions in 1997 and 1998 associated with the Company's upgrade of certain computer systems  infrastructure and the wide area network. Depreciation on corporate assets represented 0.5% of total revenues in both 1998 and 1997.       Depreciation  on real estate  assets and other costs ($28.4  million) increased $11.1 million or 63.7% as a result of 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties.  Depreciation  on real estate assets and other costs represented 14.6% of total revenues in 1998 and 14.1% in 1997.       COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996       Since December 31, 1996, the gross investment in rental property increased from $598 million to $936 million as of December 31, 1997 due to the acquisition of the following properties (the "1997 Acquisition Properties"): (i) California Hawaiian on March 14, 1997; (ii) Golf Vista Estates on March 27, 1997; (iii) Golden Terrace South on May 30, 1997; (iv) a portfolio of eighteen manufactured home communities and two commercial properties (collectively, the "MPW Properties") on August 29, 1997; (v) Arrowhead Village on September 16, 1997, and (vi) seventeen of the Ellenburg Communities on December 18, 1997. The total number of sites owned and controlled increased from 27,356 as of December 31, 1996 to 44,108 as of December 31, 1997.       The following table summarizes certain weighted average statistics for the  years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996.  "Core Portfolio" represents an analysis of properties owned during both periods of comparison.                                                        Core Portfolio                   Total Portfolio                                             -----------------------------      -------------------------                                                1997              1996             1997           1996                                             -----------       -----------      -----------    ----------               Total sites                               25,631            25,554           29,323        26,621      Occupied sites                            24,319            24,098           27,770        25,025      Occupancy %                                 94.9%             94.3%            94.7%         94.0%      Monthly base rent per site               $   325           $   312          $   327       $   310        Base rental income ($109 million) increased $15.9 million or 17.0%. For the Core Portfolio,  base rental income increased approximately $4.7 million or 5.2%,  reflecting a 4.3% increase in base rental rates and a 0.9% increase related to occupancy.  The remaining $11.2 million increase in base rental income was attributed to the 1997 Acquisition Properties.       Monthly base rent per site for the total portfolio increased 5.5%, reflecting a 4.2% increase in monthly base rent per site for the Core Portfolio and higher monthly base rents for the 1997 Acquisition Properties.  Average monthly base rent per site for the 1997 Acquisition Properties was $343 for the year ended December 31, 1997.       Weighted average occupancy increased 0.7% due to increased occupancy at the expansion communities and the addition of the 1997 Acquisition Properties with higher occupancy percentages to the portfolio.       Utility and other income ($11.8 million) increased $3.0 million or 33.6%, primarily due to an increase of $1.2 million attributed to the 1997 Acquisition Properties,  the collection of dividend income of $173,000 in the first quarter of 1997, and increased utility income, real estate tax pass-ons and other miscellaneous income at the Core Portfolio.                                          20    21         Interest income ($1.9 million) decreased $479,000 or 19.8%, primarily due to the repayment of $13 million of notes receivable in August 1997, partially offset by an increase in interest earned on short-term investments. Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996 of approximately $4.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 5.4% per annum in both years.       Property operating and maintenance expenses ($32.3 million) increased $3.9 million or 13.9% due to the impact of the 1997 Acquisition Properties and an increase in property payroll, property general and administrative expenses and insurance and other expenses at the Core Portfolio. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense and utility expense at the Core Portfolio. Property operating and maintenance expenses represented 26.2% of total revenues in 1997 and 27.0% in 1996.       Real estate taxes ($8.4 million) increased $405,000 or 5.1% due to the impact of the 1997 Acquisition Properties, partially offset by a decrease in the Core Portfolio due to lower than expected assessed values at certain of the properties based on actual bills received. Real estate taxes represented 6.8% of total revenues in 1997 and 7.6% in 1996.       Property management expenses ($5.1 million) increased $741,000 or 17.1%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in management company payroll and incremental costs associated with self management of the 1997 Acquisition Properties. Property management expenses represented 4.1% of total revenues in both 1997 and 1996.       G&A ($4.6 million) increased $497,000 or 12.2%.  The increase was primarily due to increased payroll resulting from salary increases.  G&A represented 3.7% of total revenues in 1997 and 3.9% in 1996.       EBITDA increased $12.7 million or 21%. Approximately $7.6 million of the increase related to the 1997 Acquisition Properties. The remaining increase reflected increased base rental income and decreased repairs and maintenance expense, utility expense and real estate tax expense, partially offset by increased payroll expense, property general and administrative expense and insurance and other expenses at the Core Portfolio. In addition, corporate G&A and property management expenses increased. EBITDA represented 59.2% of total revenues in 1997 and 57.5% in 1996.       Interest and related amortization ($21.8 million) increased $4.0 million or 22.3%. The increase was due to higher weighted average outstanding debt balances during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996 were $301.3 million and $234.9 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.1% in 1997 and 7.2% in 1996. Interest and related amortization represented 17.6% of total revenues in 1997 and 16.9% in 1996.       On December 12, 1997, the Company refinanced the $100.0 million mortgage note (the "Original Mortgage Debt") with a $265.0 million mortgage note (see discussion above). In October 1996, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "1997 Swap") fixing LIBOR on the Original Mortgage Debt at 5.57% effective January 10, 1997 through March 3, 1998. The Company sold the 1997 Swap in December 1997 for approximately $26,000 in connection with the refinancing.       Depreciation on corporate assets ($590,000) increased $102,000 or 20.9% due to fixed asset additions in 1996 associated with the Company's conversion to a new accounting software system. Depreciation on corporate assets represented 0.5% of total revenues in both 1997 and 1996.       Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs ($17.4 million) increased $2.1 million or 13.9% as a result of the 1997 Acquisition Properties. In addition, the Company recognized a one-time gain of $18,000 representing gains on the prepayment of notes receivable and the sale of certain assets related to the Chateau Communities, Inc. merger attempt, partially offset by the write-off of certain deferred compensation.  Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs represented 14.1% of total revenues in 1997 and  14.5% in 1996.       In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company recognized an extraordinary item for early extinguishment of the Original Mortgage Debt of $556,000.                                          21    22 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Net cash provided by operating activities increased $17.4 million from $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 to $72.0 million for the same period in 1998. This increase reflected a $13.3 million increase in FFO, which reflected increases in rental income as discussed in "Results of Operations" above, and an increase in accounts payable and real estate tax accruals and rents received in advance related to the property acquisitions, partially offset by increased prepaid expenses.       Net cash provided by operating activities increased $4.9 million from $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 to $54.6 million for the same period in 1997. This increase reflected an $8.6 million increase in FFO, which reflected increases in rental income and decreases of certain expenses as discussed in "Results of Operations" above, and an increase in collection of rents received in advance and security deposits related to the property acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and rents receivable and decreased accounts payable accruals.       FFO was defined by NAREIT in March 1995 as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for significant non-recurring items, if any. In the first quarter of 1996, the Company adopted this new definition of FFO which was effective for periods ending after December 31, 1995. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Funds available for distribution ("FAD") is defined as FFO less non-revenue producing capital expenditures. The Company believes that FFO and FAD are useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, they provide investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO and FAD in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.       The following table presents a calculation of FFO and FAD for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 (amounts in thousands):                                                                                        For the Years Ended                                                                                        December 31,                                                                      ------------------------------------------------            Computation of funds from operations:                        1998                1997              1996                                                                         ----------          ---------        ----------                          Income before allocation to minority interests                                                                          and extraordinary item......................         $  35,663          $  33,469        $   26,943                     Depreciation on real estate assets and                                                                                     other costs..........................            28,426             17,365            15,244                     Gain on sale of assets....................               ---                ---               ---                                                                       ----------          ---------        ----------                 Funds from operations.........................         $  64,089          $  50,834        $   42,187                                                                        =========          =========        ==========             Computation of funds available for distribution:                                                                           Funds from operations.........................         $  64,089          $  50,834        $   42,187                     Non-revenue producing improvements -                                                                       rental properties......................

On September 4, 1997, the Company entered into a portfolio purchase agreement (as amended by a supplemental agreement on December 17, 1997) to acquire 38 manufactured home communities (the "Ellenburg Communities") from partnerships having Ellenburg Capital Corporation ("ECC") as the general partner for a purchase price in excess of $300 million. From December 17, 1997 through December 31, 1998, the Company closed on the acquisition of thirty-one of the Ellenburg Communities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $278 million and gained control of an additional five Ellenburg Communities with acquisition advances of approximately $57 million to the partnerships which own such Ellenburg Communities. The Company funded the acquisition advances with borrowings under the Company's line of credit and term bank facilities. In addition, the Company assumed debt of approximately $32 million and issued OP Units of approximately $4.9 million in connection with this transaction.       During 1998, the Company received approximately $14.3 million, including approximately $365,000 of interest income, which was being held subject to the completion of due diligence procedures on the Ellenburg Communities. The persons appointed to windup the affairs of ECC have released the funds and have presented a status report to the court. The $14.3 million has been recorded as a liability until certain related issues are finalized at which point the final liability will be relieved and the purchase price of the Ellenburg Communities adjusted accordingly.       On January 6, 1998, the Company funded a $12.3 million loan (the "Meadows Loan") to Meadows Preservation, Inc. The Meadows Loan is collateralized by The Meadows manufactured home community located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, bears interest at a nominal rate of 9%, subject to adjustment based on cash flow of the property, and matures on April 30, 1999.       On January 8, 1998, the Company acquired Quail Meadows, located in  Riverbank, California, for a purchase price of approximately $4.7 million. The  acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.  Quail Meadows consists of approximately 146 developed sites.       On April 30, 1998, the Company acquired Sherwood Forest RV Resort, located adjacent to one of the Ellenburg Communities in Kissimmee, Florida, for a purchase price of approximately $7.0 million. The acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sherwood Forest RV Resort consists of approximately 512 developed sites and a 33 acre expansion parcel.       On May 14, 1998, the Company acquired Casa Del Sol Resort III, located  adjacent to one of the Company's communities in Peoria, Arizona, for a purchase  price of approximately $9.8 million.  The acquisition was funded with a  borrowing under the Company's line of credit.  Casa Del Sol Resort III consists  of 238 developed sites.       On June 4, 1998, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Wolverine Investors L.L.C. to acquire the College Heights Communities. The aggregate purchase price for the College Heights Communities was approximately $89 million. The Company contributed approximately $19 million to the joint venture, Wolverine Investors L.L.C. contributed approximately $2.0 million to the joint venture and the remainder of the acquisition was funded with a borrowing from a financial institution of approximately $68 million. The Company's $19 million contribution to the joint venture was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Due to the Company's ability to control the joint venture through its ownership percentage, the joint venture has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.       On August 13, 1998, the Company acquired Sunset Oaks, located in Plant  City, Florida,  adjacent to one of the Company's existing properties, for a  purchase price of approximately $3.6 million. The acquisition was funded with a  borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sunset Oaks consists of 168  developed sites.                                         23       24         Capital expenditures for improvements were approximately $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Of the $14.2 million, approximately $8 million represented improvements to existing sites including $3.5 million related to newly acquired properties. The Company anticipates spending approximately $6.7 million on improvements to existing sites during 1999. The Company believes these improvements are necessary in order to increase and/or maintain occupancy levels and maintain competitive market rents for new and renewing residents. The remaining $6.2 million represented costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's Properties and other corporate headquarter costs.       Net cash provided by financing activities increased $18.1 million from $185.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 to $203.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily due to the issuance of common stock in the second quarter of 1998, partially offset by decreased net proceeds from the line of credit, term loan and mortgage notes payable.       Net cash provided by financing activities increased $174.6 million from $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 to $185.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 primarily due to the addition of the New Mortgage Debt whereby the Company borrowed an additional $165 million, increased borrowings on the line of credit, and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the purchase of 330,300 shares of the Company's common stock under the common stock repurchase plan, increased distributions to common stockholders and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the Debt Refinancing.       On April 23, 1998, the Company completed an offering of 1,048,059 shares of common stock (the "Unit Trust Offering") and sold the shares to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the "Underwriter"). The offering price per share was $25.4375, the closing price for shares of the Company's common stock on April 23, 1998, resulting in gross offering proceeds of approximately $26.7 million. Net of the Underwriter's discount and offering expenses, the Company received approximately $25 million. The Underwriter deposited the shares of common stock with the trustee of the Equity Investor Fund Cohen & Steers Realty Majors Portfolio, a unit investment trust (the "Trust"), in exchange for units in the Trust.       For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company declared and paid quarterly distributions totaling $1.45 per share. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company declared and paid quarterly distributions totaling $1.32 per share. Return of capital on a GAAP basis was $0.33, $0.15 and $0.24 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.       Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or  annual rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve  increases, where justified by the market, in rental income as each lease  matures.  Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the  Company.       The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing line of credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to working capital.       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which is required to be adopted in years beginning after June 15, 1999. SFAS No. 133 permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance. The Company has not yet determined the date at which it will adopt SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 will require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company has not yet determined what the effect of SFAS No. 133 will be on the earnings and financial position of the Company.                                          24      25    YEAR 2000       The year 2000 issue ("Year 2000") is the result of computer programs and embedded processors ("Systems") failing to properly account for the end of 1999 and the rollover to the year 2000. The Year 2000 issue comes from three date-related problems and practices. First some Systems define the year-portion of date fields with two digits instead of four. As a result, programs and equipment that have time-sensitive functions may interpret a date using "00" as being 1900 rather than 2000. Second, the year 2000 is a leap year. There is a possibility that some Systems may fail to account for the leap day properly. Third, in practice, an artificial date of "9/9/99" is sometimes used as a fictitious date when testing Systems. It is possible that some Systems will reject the actual date of "September 9, 1999" as fictitious. Problems arising from one or more of these problems and practices could result in failure of one or more Systems causing a disruption of operations, including, among other things, a temporary inability to process transactions, collect rents, or engage in similar normal business activities.       Utilizing purchasing records, inventory listings, and direct communication with employees, the Company is in the process of identifying all of its information technology ("IT") and non-IT systems and assessing them for Year 2000 readiness. Critical systems include, but are not limited to: accounts receivable, sales and inventory, human resources and payroll, accounts payable and general ledger, Lotus Notes, Microsoft Office, tax preparation and filing software, computers, data networking equipment, telephone systems, fax machines and photocopiers, security and life safety systems (elevators, alarm systems), process control systems (pool pumps and chlorine systems, sprinkler systems), cable television systems, lift stations, and drinking water and waste water treatment plants. The Company has completed the inventory and research phases of its preparations for the Year 2000. Review of the research material continues in the first quarter of 1999, as does on-site inspections of the utilities (drinking water and waste water treatment plants, lift stations, and cable television systems). The Company has retained consultants to handle assessment of its drinking water, waste water treatment, lift station and cable television facilities for which it is responsible. The Company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the Company's interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties' failure to remediate their own Year 2000 issues. The Company anticipates that scheduled system upgrades to its accounts receivable system, accounts payable and general ledger system, and payroll system will remediate current Year 2000 concerns. Remediation steps and development of contingency plans will be completed in the second quarter of 1999. The Company has set a deadline for Year 2000 readiness of June 30, 1999. There can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the Company's Systems rely will be timely converted and will not have an adverse effect on the Company's Systems.       Through December 31, 1998, the Company's costs associated with remediation efforts have been immaterial. In 1998, the Company retained a full-time contract employee to perform Year 2000 research and documentation at an annual fee of approximately $45,000 and has budgeted to retain the employee through 1999. The cost to retain a consultant to assess the waste water treatment and cable television facilities has been budgeted at less than $50,000. The Company expects that replacement of approximately 75 computers will be required with a capital budget of approximately $200,000. The Company's total Year 2000 project costs and estimates to complete do not include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third-party Year 2000 issues. The total cost of the Year 2000 project is estimated to be immaterial assuming third parties remediate their own Year 2000 issues. This assumption is based on management's best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events, and there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.       The Company has commenced its contingency planning for critical operational areas that might be affected by the Year 2000 issue if compliance is delayed. Aside from catastrophic failure of banks, governmental agencies, etc., the Company believes that it could continue operations. For example, rent can be collected and recorded by manual methods using hardcopy reports from previous months; payroll can be processed by issuing manual checks relying on existing payroll registers; bills can be paid as long as banks can process checks; and basic financial statements can be prepared manually.  ITEM 7A.  QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK      The Company's earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on LIBOR. The Company's $175 million line of credit ($145 million outstanding at December 31, 1998) bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% and the Company's $100 million Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0%. The Company has the 1998 Swap which fixes LIBOR at 6.4% on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt for the period 1998 through 2003. If LIBOR increased/decreased by 1.0% during 1998, interest expense would have increased/decreased by approximately $1.0 million based on the average balance outstanding under the Company's line of credit for the year ended December 31, 1998. Information relating to quantitive and qualitive disclosure about market risk as it relates to the 1998 Swap is set forth in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Note 9 "Long Term Borrowings" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is incorporated herein.                                          25      26   ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
