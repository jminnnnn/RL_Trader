ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS      OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  2005 ACCOMPLISHMENTS  - -    Created greater financial flexibility through            -    refinancing $293 million of debt secured by 35 Properties in two                cross-collateralized pools maturing in 2007 with an effective                interest rate of 6.8% per annum, with new financing of $337                million of individual mortgage loans on 20 Properties with an                effective interest rate of approximately 5.3% per annum and            -    issuing $75 million of Perpetual Preference units using net                proceeds to pay down the Company's lines of credit.  - -    Increased presence in the Northeast with acquisitions in New York and      Maine.  - -    Increased new home sales by 50%.  - -    Continued to develop leading brand names such as Encore and Thousand      Trails, creating a larger customer resource base.  - -    Launched customer loyalty program, known as Encore Royalty Club, in an      effort to increase seasonal and annual customer base.  OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK       Occupancy in our Properties as well as our ability to increase rental rates directly affect revenues. Our revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting our sites on a long-term basis.       We have approximately 60,400 annual sites with average annual revenue of approximately $5,100 per site. We have approximately 8,000 seasonal sites, which are leased to customers generally for 3 to 6 months, for which we expect to collect annual rent in the range of $1,900 to $2,000 per site. We also have approximately 6,500 transient sites, occupied by customers who lease on a short-term basis, for which we expect to collect average annual rent per site in the range of $2,600 to $2,800. We expect to service 60,000 customers with these sites. However, we consider this revenue stream to be our most volatile. It is subject to weather conditions, gas prices, and other factors affecting the marginal RV customer's vacation and travel preferences. Finally, we have approximately 17,900 Thousand Trails sites for which we receive ground rent of $16 million annually with yearly escalations of 3.25%. This rent is classified in Income from other investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have interests in Properties owning approximately 13,500 sites for which revenue is classified as Equity in Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.                                     TOTAL SITES                               AS OF DECEMBER 31             APPROXIMATE ANNUAL                               (ROUNDED TO 000S)              REVENUE RANGE (1)                               -----------------   -----------------------------------                                 2005      2004         2006                2005                               -------   -------   ---------------     ---------------          Community sites (2)........    44,900    45,200   $5,700 - $5,800(3)  $5,400 - $5,500(3) Resort sites:    Annuals.................    15,500    13,100   $3,000 - $3,200     $3,000 - $3,200    Seasonal................     8,000     7,200   $1,900 - $2,000     $1,800 - $1,900    Transient...............     6,500     6,000   $2,600 - $2,800     $2,300 - $2,500 Thousand Trails............    17,900    17,900 Joint Ventures.............    13,500    11,800                               -------   -------                               106,300   101,200                               =======   =======   (1)  All ranges exclude utility and other income.  (2)  Includes 2,076 sites from discontinued operations.  (3)  Based on occupied sites. Average occupancy as of 12/31/05 was approximately      90%.                                          25   SERP TERMINATION       As a result of the changes in the law relating to deferred compensation plans, the Company terminated its Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan ("the Plan"). Termination of the Plan resulted in a taxable distribution to the participants, who received all of the assets that were held in their Plan account, net of applicable withholding taxes. These assets included approximately 900,000 shares of ELS common stock in the aggregate, including approximately 825,000 shares of ELS common stock held in the Plan accounts of ELS' executive officers and directors. All of the shares of ELS common stock held in Plan accounts that were distributed are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the federal securities laws, except for shares held in the Plan accounts of executive officers and directors, which are subject to the manner and volume of sale requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Termination of the Plan had no effect on results of operations and no material impact on the Company's balance sheet. Certain executive officers of the Company may from time to time adopt non-discretionary, written trading plans that comply with Commission Rule 10b5-1; or otherwise monetize their equity-based compensation. Commission Rule 10b5-1 provides executives with a method to monetize their equity-based compensation in an automatic and non-discretionary manner over time.  PRIVILEGED ACCESS       On October 17, 2005, we announced that Mr. Joe McAdams resigned from the Company's Board of Directors in order to pursue a new venture called Privileged Access. The new company is expected to lease sites at certain of ELS' Properties for the purpose of creating flexible use products. These products may include the sale of timeshare or fractional interests in resort homes or cottages and membership and vacation-club products. Leasing our sites to Privileged Access allows us to participate in these products and activities while achieving long-term rental of our sites. The Company has yet to determine the impact this new relationship will have on its financial statements. On November 15, 2005 the Company entered into an agreement to loan Privileged Access up to $0.5 million. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $0.3 million has been borrowed by Privileged Access and is classified as a note receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The loan bears interest at prime plus 1.0% per annum and matures on November 15, 2007.  INSURANCE       Approximately 70 Florida Properties suffered damage from the four hurricanes that struck the state during August and September 2004. As of February 23, 2006, approximately $19.4 million of claims, including business interruption, have been submitted to our insurance companies for reimbursement. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has made total expenditures of approximately $11.9 million and expects to incur additional expenditures to complete the work necessary to restore our Properties to their pre-hurricanes condition. The Company has received proceeds from insurance carriers of approximately $2.6 million as of December 31, 2005. The Company has reserved approximately $2.0 million related to these expenditures ($0.7 million in 2005 and $1.3 million in 2004). Approximately $3.4 million of these expenditures have been capitalized per the Company's capitalization policy as of December 31, 2005. Approximately $3.9 million is included in other assets as a receivable from insurance providers as of December 31, 2005, and approximately $5.9 million was included in other assets as of December 31, 2004.       In 2005, the Company reduced the book value of its assets by approximately $1.0 million due to damage caused by these 2004 storms. The Company received insurance proceeds of approximately $0.8 million relating to other matters. Both of these items were recorded in income from other investments, net.       During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company spent approximately $1.3 million on Properties located in South Florida impacted by Hurricane Wilma to get them operationally ready for the season. This amount has been charged to operations in 2005. The Company is still evaluating the total costs it expects to incur and is preparing its insurance claim.                                          26    PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND DISPOSITIONS       The following chart lists the Properties or portfolios acquired, invested in, or sold since January 1, 2004:        PROPERTY                                       TRANSACTION DATE     SITES     --------                                      ------------------   -------      TOTAL SITES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2004..............                         53,429  PROPERTY OR PORTFOLIO (# OF PROPERTIES IN    PARENTHESES):    O'Connell's.................................

The total number of sites owned or controlled increased from 53,429 as of December 31, 2003 to 106,337 as of December 31, 2005.                                          27    MARKETS       The following table identifies our five largest markets by number of sites and provides information regarding our Properties (excludes Properties owned through Joint Ventures).

We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  Long-Lived Assets       In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS No. 141"), we allocate the purchase price of Properties we acquire to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective Property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each Property as a result of our due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.       We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.       Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We use a 30-year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts       Rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue and is recognized over the term of the respective lease or the length of a customer's stay, the majority of which are for a term of not greater than one year. We monitor the collectibility of accounts receivable from our tenants on an on-going basis. We will reserve for receivables when we believe the ultimate collection is less than probable and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded during each period and the associated bad debt expense is included in our property operating and maintenance expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The allowance for doubtful accounts is netted against tenant and other receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. Our provision for uncollectible rents receivable was approximately $1.2 million as of December 31, 2005 and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2004.       We also finance the sale of homes to our customers (referred to as "Chattel Loans") through loans. The valuation of an allowance for doubtful accounts for the Chattel Loans is calculated based on a comparison of the outstanding principal balance of each note compared to the N.A.D.A. (National Automobile Dealers Association) value and the current market value of the underlying manufactured home collateral. A bad debt expense is recorded in home selling expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The                                          28    allowance for doubtful accounts is netted against the notes and interest receivables on our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for these Chattel Loans as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 was $81,000 and $250,000, respectively.  Inventory       Inventory consists of new and used Site Set homes and is stated at the lower of cost or market after consideration of the N.A.D.A. Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide and the current market value of each home included in the home inventory. Inventory sales revenues and resale revenues are recognized when the home sale is closed. Inventory is recorded net of an inventory reserve as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 of $580,000 and $600,000, respectively. The expense for the inventory reserve is included in the cost of home sales in our consolidated statement of operations.  Variable Interest Entities       In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46R") - - an interpretation of ARB 51. The objective of FIN 46R is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity ("VIE") and determine when the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and results of operations of a VIE need to be included in a company's consolidated financial statements. A company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate such entity if the company absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses or receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns if they occur, or both (i.e., the primary beneficiary). The Company will apply FIN 46R to all types of entity ownership (general and limited partnerships and corporate interests).       The Company will re-evaluate and apply the provisions of FIN 46R to existing entities if certain events occur which warrant re-evaluation of such entities. In addition, the Company will apply the provisions of FIN 46R to all new entities in the future. The Company also consolidates entities in which it has a controlling direct or indirect voting interest. The equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which the Company does not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest, but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions. The cost method is applied when (i) the investment is minimal (typically less than 5%) and (ii) the Company's investment is passive.       In applying the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company determined that its $29.7 million investment in preferred equity interests (the "Mezzanine Investment") in six entities controlled by Diversified Investments, Inc. ("Diversified") (see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investing Activities) is a VIE; however, the Company concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary. As such, the adoption of this pronouncement had no effect on the Company's financial statements.  Stock-based Compensation       The valuation of financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments" ("SFAS No. 107") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Where possible, we base the fair values of our financial instruments, including our derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, we base our estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instrument.       The Company adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), ("SFAS 123(R)") "Share Based Payment" on July 1, 2005 which did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or its financial position.

Total Portfolio operating revenues increased due to current year acquisitions and 2004 acquisitions owned for the full year in 2005 (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).  PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES       The 6.2% increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in administrative expense, utility expense increases greater than CPI, and increased insurance expenses. The 4.4% increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes is generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues, increased due to payroll costs, but remains at approximately 4% of revenue. Property management expense for the Total Portfolio increased primarily due to overall Company growth and new marketing initiatives. Total Portfolio operating expenses increased due to our current year acquisitions and 2004 acquisitions owned for the full year in 2005.                                          30    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  HOME SALES OPERATIONS       The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Home Sales Operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in thousands, except sales volumes).

New home sales gross profit reflects a 50% increase in sales volume combined with an increase in average selling price of approximately $7,000 per home or approximately 8%. Used home sales gross profit reflects lower gross margin per home and lower volumes. Brokered resale revenues reflect increased resale volumes. Home selling expenses had a modest increase of 2.4%. The increase in ancillary service revenue relates primarily to income from property amenities at our 2004 acquisition Properties owned in 2005 for the full year.

Depreciation on real estate increased $8.1 million relating to the full year effect in 2005 of our 2004 acquisitions. These are partially offset by increased income from other investments that includes approximately $16.1 million of lease income from the Thousand Trails ground lease entered into on November 10, 2004.                                          31    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  EQUITY IN INCOME OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES       During 2005, we received distributions from three joint ventures relating to debt refinancings by the venture. Two of these distributions exceeded the Company's basis and therefore were included in the income from unconsolidated joint ventures. Our 2005 acquisitions and the full year effect of our 2004 acquisitions also contributed to the increase.

An increase in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility income, which resulted from higher utility expenses. Total Portfolio operating revenues increased due to acquisitions (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).  PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES       The 4.9% increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in payroll expense, administrative expense, and repair and maintenance expense. The 5.4% increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes is generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues increased mainly due to payroll and computer costs, but remains at approximately 4% of revenue.

Used home sales gross profit reflects a decrease in gross margin per home offset by an increase in volume. Brokered resale revenues reflect increased resale volumes.

This is partially offset by income from other investments that includes $2.3 million of lease income from the Thousand Trails ground lease entered into on November 10, 2004.                                          33    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  EQUITY IN INCOME OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES       During 2004, we invested in preferred equity interests, the Mezzanine Investment, in six entities owning 11 Properties and 5,054 sites. Our average return on the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a rate of 10% per annum. We also invested in 11 separate joint ventures (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investing Activities"). These investments contributed to the increase in equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY       As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $0.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $122.3 million available on its lines of credit. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing lines of credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under its existing lines of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to net cash provided by operating activities. The table below summarizes cash flow activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (amounts in thousands).                                                         FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED                                                             DECEMBER 31,                                                   --------------------------------                                                     2005        2004        2003                                                   --------   ---------   ---------        Cash provided by operating activities             $ 90,326   $  46,733   $  75,163 Cash used in investing activities                  (66,246)   (366,654)       (598) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities    (28,775)       (514)    243,905                                                   --------   ---------   --------- Net (decrease) increase in cash                   $ (4,695)  $(320,435)  $ 318,470                                                   ========   =========   =========   OPERATING ACTIVITIES       Net cash provided by operating activities increased $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase reflects increases in property operating income as discussed in "Results of Operations" above and a decrease in working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $75.2 million in 2003. This decrease reflects increased interest expense as a result of the Recap in October 2003 and increases in working capital, partially offset by increases in property operating income as discussed in "Results of Operations" above.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES       Net cash used in investing activities reflects the impact of the following investing activities:  ACQUISITIONS       During the year ended December 31, 2005, we acquired seven Properties (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K). The combined real estate investment in these Properties was approximately $89.9 million and was funded with money drawn from our lines of credit and debt assumed of $53.5 million. We also assumed approximately $5.4 million in escrow deposits and $4.0 million of rents received in advance as a result of these acquisitions. Certain purchase price adjustments may be made within one year following the acquisitions.       During the year ended December 31, 2004, we acquired 111 Properties. The combined investment in real estate for these 111 Properties was approximately $703 million and was funded with monies held in short-term investments, debt assumed of $352 million which includes a mark-to-market adjustment of $10.4 million, new financing of $124 million, and borrowings from our lines of credit. Included in the above as previously described are 57 Properties purchased as part of the Thousand Trails Transaction; the income related to this transaction is classified as income from other investments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.                                          34    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)       We assumed inventory of approximately $1.2 million, other assets of $4.9 million, rents received in advance of approximately $13.6 million and other liabilities of approximately $5.8 million in connection with the 2004 acquisitions. The Company also issued common OP Units for value of approximately $32.2 million.       During 2003, we acquired three Properties at a purchase price of $11.8 million. The acquisitions were funded with monies held in short-term investments and debt assumed of $4.6 million. The acquisitions included the assumption of liabilities of approximately $0.7 million. Also during 2003, we acquired a parcel of land adjacent to one of our Properties for approximately $0.1 million.       We continue to look at acquiring additional assets and are at various stages of negotiations with respect to potential acquisitions. Funding is expected to be provided by either proceeds from potential dispositions, lines of credit draws, or other financing.  DISPOSITIONS       During the year ended December 31, 2005, we sold one Property located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa for a selling price of $6.7 million. Net proceeds of $6.3 million were used to repay amounts on our lines of credit. A gain on sale of approximately $2.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2005.       During the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold one Property located in Lake Placid, Florida for a selling price of $3.4 million, with net proceeds of $0.8 million received in July 2004. No gain or loss on disposition was recognized in the period. In addition, we sold approximately 1.4 acres of land in Montana for a gain and net proceeds of $0.6 million.       During the year ended December 31, 2003, we sold three Properties for proceeds of $27.1 million and a gain of $10.8 million. Proceeds from the sales were used to repay amounts on our line of credit.       We currently have six all-age Properties held for disposition and are in various stages of negotiations for sale. We plan to reinvest the sale proceeds or reduce outstanding lines of credit.       The operating results of all properties sold or held for disposition have been reflected in the discontinued operations of the Consolidated Statements of Operations contained in this Form 10-K.  INVESTMENTS IN AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS       During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company invested approximately $7.0 million for a 50% preferred joint venture interest in three Properties located near Bar Harbor, Maine. The Company also invested approximately $0.6 million for a 40% interest in a Texas Property owned by a joint venture controlled by Diversified Investments, Inc.       During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company invested approximately $29.7 million in preferred equity interests in six entities controlled by Diversified. These entities own in the aggregate 11 Properties, containing 5,054 sites. Approximately $11.7 million of the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a per annum average rate of 10%, with a minimum pay rate of 6.5% per annum, payable quarterly, and approximately $17.9 million of the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a per annum average rate of 11%, with a minimum pay rate of 7% per annum, payable quarterly. To the extent the minimum pay rates on the respective Mezzanine Investments are not achieved, the accrual rates increase to 12% and 13% per annum, respectively. In addition, the Company invested approximately $1.4 million in the Diversified entities managing these 11 Properties, which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005.       During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company invested approximately $4.1 million in 11 joint ventures controlled by Diversified. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $6.5 million, $3.7 million and $0.3 million of net income from joint ventures, net of $2.0 million, $1.2 million and $0.8 million of depreciation in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company received approximately $11.3 million, $5.2 million and $0.8 million in distributions from such joint ventures for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, $2.2 million and $0.5 million exceeded the Company's basis and thus was recorded in income from unconsolidated joint ventures. Due to the Company's inability to control the joint ventures, the Company accounts for its investment in the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.                                          35    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS       Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as recurring capital expenditures ("Recurring CapEx"), site development costs and corporate costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $15.9 million, $13.7 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Included in Recurring CapEx for 2005 is approximately $3.4 million of costs incurred to replace hurricane damaged assets. Site development costs were approximately $16.2 million, $13.0 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's Properties and costs for improvements to sites when a smaller used home is replaced with a larger new home. Corporate costs such as computer hardware, office furniture and office improvements and expansion were $0.8 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES       Net cash used in financing activities reflects the impact of the following:  MORTGAGES AND CREDIT FACILITIES  FINANCING, REFINANCING AND EARLY DEBT RETIREMENT       During the third quarter of 2005, the Company refinanced two mortgage loans for proceeds of $34 million at an interest rate of 4.95% per annum. Net proceeds were used to pay down approximately $20 million in other secured financing maturing in 2006.       On December 2, 2005, the Company refinanced approximately $293 million of secured debt maturing in 2007 with an effective interest rate of 6.8% per annum. This debt was secured by two cross-collateralized loan pools consisting of 35 Properties. The transaction generated approximately $337 million in proceeds from loans secured by individual mortgages on 20 Properties. The blended interest rate on the refinancing was approximately 5.3% per annum and the loans mature in 2015. Transaction costs were approximately $20.0 million ($0.67 per fully diluted share) and are classified as early debt retirement on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining excess proceeds were used to repay outstanding amounts on our lines of credit. This transaction strengthens the Company's balance sheet by extending its weighted average years to maturity by approximately two years.       During the third quarter of 2005, in connection with its acquisitions, the Company assumed mortgages of approximately $53.5 million at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.9% per annum.       In 2004, the Company assumed mortgage and other debt relating to acquisitions of approximately $157 million, which was recorded at fair market value with the related premium being amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest rate. The Company borrowed an additional $194 million of mortgage debt for other acquisitions. The mortgages bear interest at weighted average rates ranging from 5.14% to 5.81% per annum, and mature at various dates through November 1, 2027. In addition, in connection with the Thousand Trails Transaction, we secured a $120 million three-year term loan at London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.75%.       In 2003, the Company initiated the Recap as a result of its belief in the stability of its cash flow from property operations and the attractive financing terms available to borrowers such as the Company in the secured debt markets. In conducting its evaluation of the use of proceeds from the Recap, the Company's Board of Directors believed that to the extent no attractive alternative use was available, a distribution to stockholders should occur. In late 2003, the Company identified acquisition targets which would use approximately $100 million of the $325 million in net proceeds resulting from the Recap. In December 2003, the Company's Board of Directors declared a distribution of approximately $225 million ($8 per share). During 2004, the Company identified additional acquisitions and has funded such acquisitions primarily with secured and unsecured borrowings.                                          36    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)       The Recap and subsequent borrowings in connection with acquisitions have significantly increased the Company's outstanding debt. The interest and principal payments required under these debt agreements materially increase the Company's future contractual payment obligations. In light of these increased cash flow requirements, the Company reduced its annual dividend to common stockholders from approximately $44 million in 2003 to $1 million in 2004 and to $2.5 million in 2005. In addition, the Company's cash from operations increased significantly from 2003 due to the cash generated by newly-acquired Properties. To the extent cash flow from the Properties does not meet the Company's expectations, the Company's Board of Directors increases the annual dividend significantly, or the Company is required to make significant unexpected capital improvements or other payments, the Company's financial flexibility and ability to meet scheduled obligations could be negatively impacted.       In October 2003, the Company unwound an interest rate swap ("2001 Swap") agreement at a cost of approximately $3 million, which is included in interest and related amortization in 2003 in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The 2001 swap effectively fixed LIBOR on $100 million of our floating rate debt at approximately 3.7% per annum for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of the 2001 Swap required monthly settlements on the same dates interest payments were due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the 2001 Swap was reflected at market value.       On April 17, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to refinance and increase the "Bay Indies Mortgage", a $44.5 million note, from approximately $21.9 million to $45 million. Under the new agreement, the Bay Indies Mortgage bears interest at 5.69% per annum, amortizes over 25 years and matures April 17, 2013. The net proceeds were used to pay down the Company's line of credit. Also during the year ended December 31, 2003, mortgage notes payable on four other Properties were repaid totaling approximately $23.5 million using proceeds from borrowings on the Company's line of credit.  SECURED DEBT       As of December 31, 2005, our securitized long-term debt balance was approximately $1.5 billion, with a weighted average interest rate in 2005 of approximately 6.32% per annum. The debt bears interest at rates between 4.17% and 7.19% per annum and matures on various dates mainly ranging from 2007 to 2015. Included in our debt balance are three capital leases with an imputed interest rate of 11.6% per annum. We do not have any significant long-term debt maturing in 2006 or 2007 with $227 million being the maximum amount maturing in any of the succeeding 5 years beginning in 2008. The weighted average term to maturity for the long-term debt is approximately 7.3 years.  UNSECURED DEBT       We have two unsecured lines of credit of $110 million and $50 million which bear interest at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus 1.65%. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2005, we borrowed $175.3 million and paid down $253.4 million on our lines of credit. The weighted average interest rate in 2005 for our unsecured debt was approximately 5.02% per annum. The balance outstanding as of December 31, 2005 was $37.7 million. As of February 8, 2006, approximately $146.4 million is available to be drawn on these combined lines of credit.       We have a $120 million three-year term loan at LIBOR plus 1.75%. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid down $20 million of the term loan. The weighted average interest rate on this debt in 2005 was approximately 4.94% per annum. In December 2005, we fixed $100 million of this variable debt for one year with a weighted average per annum interest rate of 6.58% per annum.                                          37    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)  OTHER LOANS       During 2005, the Company borrowed $2.4 million to finance its insurance premium payments. As of December 31, 2005, $230,000 remained outstanding. This loan has currently been paid off.       Certain of the Company's mortgage and credit agreements contain covenants and restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured debt versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed charges-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), limitations on certain holdings and other restrictions.       As of December 31, 2005, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below (dollars in thousands):    CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS                   TOTAL     2006(2)    2007(3)     2008       2009      2010     THEREAFTER - -----------                ----------   -------   --------   --------   -------   --------   ----------                Long Term    Borrowings (1).......   $1,631,466   $53,622   $135,395   $201,605   $75,049   $227,340    $938,455 Weighted average    interest rates.......         6.07%     6.09%      6.23%      5.65%     6.94%      7.17%       5.81%   (1)  Balance excludes net premiums and discounts of $6.9 million.  (2)  Includes lines of credit repayments in 2006 of $37.7 million. We have an      option to extend this maturity for one year to 2007.  (3)  Includes a Term Loan repayment in 2007 of $100 million. We have an option      to extend this maturity for two additional one-year terms to 2009.       Included in the above table are certain capital lease obligations totaling approximately $6.5 million. These agreements expire June 2009 and are paid semi-annually at an imputed interest rate of 11.6% per annum.       In addition, the Company has various contracts with vendors to perform services in the future for its operations. These contracts include terms for cancellation and are individually immaterial.       In addition, the Company leases land under non-cancelable operating leases at certain of the Properties expiring in various years from 2022 to 2032 with terms which require 12 equal payments per year plus additional rents calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, ground lease rent was approximately $1.6 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million per year, respectively. Minimum future rental payments under the ground leases are approximately $1.6 million for each of the next five years and approximately $21.3 million thereafter.       With respect to maturing debt, the Company has staggered the maturities of our long-term mortgage debt over an average of approximately 7 years, with no more than $600 million in principal maturities coming due in any single year. The Company believes that it will be able to refinance its maturing debt obligations on a secured or unsecured basis; however, to the extent the Company is unable to refinance its debt as it matures, it believes that it will be able to repay such maturing debt from asset sales and/or the proceeds from equity issuances. With respect to any refinancing of maturing debt, the Company's future cash flow requirements could be impacted by significant changes in interest rates or other debt terms, including required amortization payments.                                          38    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)  EQUITY TRANSACTIONS       In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute 90% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) to its stockholders. The following distributions have been declared and paid to common stockholders and minority interests since January 1, 2003.

This allows the Company to continue to take advantage of its financial flexibility while recognizing the importance of its dividend to its stockholders.       On March 24, 2005, the Operating Partnership issued $25 million of 8.0625% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Units (the "Series D 8% Units"), to institutional investors. The Series D 8% Units are non-callable for five years. In addition, the Operating Partnership had an existing $125 million of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Units (the "Series D 9% Units") outstanding that were callable by the Company as of September 2004. In connection with the new issue, the Operating Partnership agreed to extend the non-call provision of the Series D 9% Units to be coterminous with the new issue, and the institutional investors holding the Series D 9% Units agreed to lower the rate on such units to 8.0625%. All of the units have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the Company's lines of credit.       On June 30, 2005, the Operating Partnership issued $50 million of 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Units (the "Series F Units"), to institutional investors. The Series F Units are non-callable for five years and have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the Company's lines of credit.       On March 24, 2005, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 9.0% per annum on the $125 million of Series D 9% Units. For the seven days ended March 31, 2005 and the nine months thereafter, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 8.0625% per annum on the $150 million Series D 8% Units. For the six months ended December 31, 2005 the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 7.95% per annum on the $50 million of Series F 7.95% Units. Distributions on the Preferred Units were paid quarterly on the last calendar day of each quarter.  2004 Activities       During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, in connection with its 2004 acquisitions the Company issued 1.2 million common OP Units valued at $36.7 million of which approximately $28.7 million has been classified as paid-in capital. On December 21, 2004 we redeemed 126,765 common OP Units for approximately $4.5 million of which approximately $3.5 million has been classified as paid-in capital.                                          39    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)  2003 Activities       On December 12, 2003, we declared a one-time special distribution of $8.00 per share payable to stockholders of record on January 8, 2004. We used proceeds from the $501 million Recap in October 2003 to pay the special distribution on January 16, 2004. The special cash dividend was reflected on stockholders' 2004 1099-DIV issued in January 2005.       In connection with the $501 million Recap and subsequent special distribution, on February 27, 2004, the Company contributed all of its assets to MHC Trust, a newly formed Maryland real estate investment trust, including the Company's entire partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The Company determined that a taxable transaction in connection with the special distribution to stockholders would be in the Company's best interests. This was accomplished by the contribution of the Company's interest in the Operating Partnership to MHC Trust in exchange for all of the common and preferred stock of MHC Trust. Due to the Company's tax basis in its interest in the Operating Partnership, the Company recognized $180 million of taxable income as a result of its contribution, as opposed to a nontaxable reduction of the Company's tax basis in its interest in the Operating Partnership. This restructuring resulted in a step-up in the Company's tax basis in its assets, generating future depreciation deductions, which in turn will reduce the Company's future distribution requirements. This provides the Company with greater financial flexibility and greater growth potential. The Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code, with its assets consisting of interests in MHC Trust. MHC Trust, in turn, also intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code and will continue to be the general partner of the Operating Partnership. On May 1, 2004, in connection with the restructuring, MHC Trust sold cumulative preferred stock to a limited number of unaffiliated investors.  INFLATION       Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation to the Company. In addition, our resort Properties are not generally subject to leases and rents are established for these sites on an annual basis.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS       Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe FFO, as defined by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), to be an appropriate measure of performance for an equity REIT. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity REITs, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance.       FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of Properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. We further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income and cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, when evaluating an equity REIT's operating performance. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.                                          40    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)       The following table presents a calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (amounts in thousands):                                                                          2005      2004      2003                                                                     -------   -------   --------        COMPUTATION OF FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS:    Net (loss) income available for Common Shares ................   $(2,333)  $ 4,026   $ 25,132    (Loss) income allocated to Common OP Units ...................

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates. The primary market risk we face is long-term indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our long-term debt obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2005, approximately 98% or approximately $1.6 billion of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates, which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures. For each increase in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately $105.2 million. For each decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total outstanding debt would increase by approximately $112.7 million.       At December 31, 2005, approximately 2% or approximately $38 million of our outstanding debt was short-term and at variable rates. Earnings are affected by increases and decreases in market interest rates on this debt. For each increase/decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), our earnings would increase/decrease by approximately $0.4 million annually.                                          42                               FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS       This report includes certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used, words such as "anticipate," "expect," "believe," "intend," "may be" and "will be" and similar words or phrases, or the negative thereof, unless the context requires otherwise, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: in the age-qualified Properties, home sales results could be impacted by the ability of potential homebuyers to sell their existing residences as well as by financial markets volatility; in the all-age Properties, results from home sales and occupancy will continue to be impacted by local economic conditions, lack of affordable manufactured home financing, and competition from alternative housing options including site-built single-family housing; our ability to maintain rental rates and occupancy with respect to Properties currently owned or pending acquisitions; our assumptions about rental and home sales markets; the completion of pending acquisitions and timing with respect thereto; the effect of interest rates as well as other risks indicated from time to time in our filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements are based on management's present expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, these statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. ELS is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise.                                          43    ITEM 8.
