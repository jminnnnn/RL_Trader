ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)       On June 4, 1998, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Wolverine Investors L.L.C. to acquire the College Heights Communities. The aggregate purchase price for the College Heights Communities was approximately $89 million. The Company contributed approximately $19 million to the joint venture, Wolverine Investors L.L.C. contributed approximately $2.0 million to the joint venture and the remainder of the acquisition was funded with a borrowing from a financial institution of approximately $68 million. The Company's $19 million contribution to the joint venture was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Due to the Company's ability to control the joint venture through its ownership percentage, the joint venture has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.       On August 13, 1998, the Company acquired Sunset Oaks, located in Plant City, Florida, adjacent to one of the Company's existing properties, for a purchase price of approximately $3.6 million. The acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sunset Oaks consists of 168 developed sites.       Capital expenditures for improvements were approximately $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Of the $14.2 million, approximately $8 million represented improvements to existing sites including $3.5 million related to newly acquired properties. The remaining $6.2 million represented costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's Properties and other corporate headquarter costs.       Net cash provided by financing activities increased $18.1 million from $185.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 to $203.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily due to the issuance of common stock in the second quarter of 1998, partially offset by decreased net proceeds from the line of credit, term loan and mortgage notes payable.       On April 23, 1998, the Company completed an offering of 1,048,059 shares of common stock (the "Unit Trust Offering") and sold the shares to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the "Underwriter"). The offering price per share was $25.4375, the closing price for shares of the Company's common stock on April 23, 1998, resulting in gross offering proceeds of approximately $26.7 million. Net of the Underwriter's discount and offering expenses, the Company received approximately $25 million. The Underwriter deposited the shares of common stock with the trustee of the Equity Investor Fund Cohen & Steers Realty Majors Portfolio, a unit investment trust (the "Trust"), in exchange for units in the Trust.       For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company declared and paid quarterly distributions totaling $1.55 per share. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company declared and paid quarterly distributions totaling $1.45 per share. Return of capital on a GAAP basis was $0.49, $0.33 and $0.17 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.       Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.       The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing line of credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to working capital.       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which is required to be adopted in years beginning after June 15, 1999. SFAS No. 133 permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement No. 137 which deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to all fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company has not yet determined the date at which it will adopt SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 will require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company has not yet determined what the effect of SFAS No. 133 will be on the earnings and financial position of the Company, when implemented.                                           24    25   FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS       FFO was defined by NAREIT in March 1995 as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for significant non-recurring items, if any. In the first quarter of 1996, the Company adopted this new definition of FFO which was effective for periods ending after December 31, 1995. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs computation. Funds available for distribution ("FAD") is defined as FFO less non-revenue producing capital expenditures. The Company believes that FFO and FAD are useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, they provide investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO and FAD in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.       The following table presents a calculation of FFO and FAD for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 (amounts in thousands):                                                                               1999            1998             1997                                                                       -------------   -------------    -------------              COMPUTATION OF FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS:         Income before extraordinary item............................      $ 27,772        $ 28,930         $ 29,096         Income allocated to Common OP Units.........................         6,219           6,733            4,373         Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs..........        34,486          28,426           17,365                                                                           --------        --------         --------            Funds from operations.....................................     $ 68,477        $ 64,089         $ 50,834                                                                           ========        ========         ========          Weighted average Common Stock outstanding - diluted.........        31,252          31,962           28,762       COMPUTATION OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION:         Funds from operations.......................................      $ 68,477        $ 64,089         $ 50,834         Non-revenue producing improvements to real estate...........

In late 1999, the Company completed its remediation and testing of systems. As a result of those planning and implementation efforts, the Company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non-information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the Year 2000 date change. The Company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year 2000 to ensure that any latent Year 2000 matters that may arise are addressed promptly.                                             25    26  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company's earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on LIBOR. The Company's $175 million line of credit ($107.9 million outstanding at December 31, 1999) bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% and the Company's $100 million Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0%. If LIBOR increased/decreased by 1.0% during 1999, interest expense would have increased/decreased by approximately $1.0 million based on the average balance outstanding under the Company's line of credit for the year ended December 31, 1998.       In July 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at 6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only of legal costs that were deemed immaterial. The value of the 1998 Swap was impacted by changes in the market rate of interest. Had the 1998 Swap been entered into on December 31, 1999, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have been approximately 6.57%. Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap rate for the 1998 Swap increases or decreases the value of the 1998 Swap versus its current value by approximately $28,000. The Company accounted for the 1998 Swap as a hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap were accounted for as an adjustment to interest expense. On January 10, 2000, the Company unwound the 1998 SWAP and received $1.0 million of proceeds which will be amortized into interest expense through March 2003.  ITEM 8.
