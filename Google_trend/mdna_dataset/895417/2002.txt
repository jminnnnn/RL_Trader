In 2001, occupancy in the Company's Core Portfolio has remained relatively stable. Also during 2001, average monthly base rental rates for the Core Portfolio increased approximately 4.5%. The Company believes these trends will continue through 2002.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES       The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.       The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate for impairment indicators. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators, are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.       The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instrument, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instrument.                                           21   COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000       Since December 31, 1999, the gross investment in real estate increased from $1,264 million to $1,238 million as of December 31, 2001, due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period. The total number of sites owned or controlled decreased from 54,002 as of December 31, 1999 to 50,761 as of December 31, 2001.       The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Core Portfolio and the Total Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

For comparison purposes, a reclassification was     made to base rental income for 2000 on this table. This reclassification is     also reflected in the monthly base rent per site amounts for 2000.  (2) Income from operations for the Core Portfolio does not include an allocation     of income from affiliates, interest income, corporate general and     administrative expense, interest expense and related amortization or     depreciation on corporate assets.  (3) Site and occupancy information does not include the Properties owned through     unconsolidated joint ventures or the RV Properties.                                          22   Revenues       The 4.7% increase in base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a 4.5% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 0.2% increase in average occupied sites. The increase in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in pass through items such as utilities and real estate taxes -- which resulted from higher expenses for these items. For the Total Portfolio, changes in base rental income and utility and other income generally reflect those of the Core Portfolio and the effect of acquisition and disposition of the Non-Core Properties.       Equity in income of affiliates decreased 24.8%, reflecting lower sales volumes. Combined home sales revenue decreased approximately $4.0 million, of which $3.3 million is attributable to a decline in new home inventory sales volume. Sales volumes for new home inventory, used home inventory and brokered home sales were 485, 250 and 1,114, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001, and 535, 290 and 1,271, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2000.       The decrease in interest income is primarily due to the repayment of certain notes receivable, fewer short-term investments and lower interest rates. Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 of approximately $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 3.8% and 6.0% per annum, respectively.   Operating Expenses       The increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility expenses passed through and included in utility income. Expenses for the Core Portfolio also reflect increases in payroll and property insurance expenses. Core Portfolio real estate taxes increased 2.8% generally due to higher assessed values on certain Properties. The increase in Total Portfolio property operating and maintenance expense and real estate taxes is also impacted by acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties. Property management expense allocated to the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property revenues, increased 5.8%.       General and administrative expenses ("G&A") increased 4.1% due to increased public company costs and related expenses and promotional costs. G&A for 2001 includes a charge for additional amortization of deferred compensation offset by a reversal of legal expenses previously accrued related to the Ellenburg settlement.       Interest and related amortization decreased due to lower interest rates during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $713.2 million and $707.5 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.0% and 7.4% per annum for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.       Depreciation on corporate assets increased due to fixed asset additions related to information and communication systems. Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs increased due primarily to the acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties.                                           23   COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999       Since December 31, 1998, the gross investment in real estate decreased from $1,237 million to $1,218 million as of December 31, 2000, due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period. The total number of sites owned or controlled decreased from 53,009 as of December 31, 1998 to 51,452 as of December 31, 2000.       The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Core Portfolio and the Total Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999.

(2) Site and occupancy information does not include the five Properties owned     through joint ventures or the three RV properties.                                          24   Revenues       The 4.5% increase in base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a 3.9% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 0.6% increase in average occupied sites. The 4.3% increase in base rental income for the Total Portfolio reflects a 3.8% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 0.5% increase in average occupied sites and also reflects the acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties. The increase in utility and other income for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in pass through items such as utilities and real estate taxes -- which resulted from higher expenses for these items. The decrease in Total Portfolio utility and other income is due primarily to the sale of Mesa Regal RV resort and other changes in the Non-Core Properties. Also included in other income is a gain on the sale of the FFEC-Six water and wastewater treatment company of $719,000, partially offset by an impairment loss on the DeAnza Santa Cruz water and wastewater service company of $701,000.       The decrease in interest income is primarily due to the repayment of certain notes receivable and fewer short-term investments. Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 of approximately $1.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 6.0% and 6.3% per annum, respectively.   Operating Expenses       The increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility expenses passed through and included in utility income. Expenses for the Core Portfolio also reflect increases in repairs and maintenance expense, payroll and property general and administrative expenses partially offset by decreased insurance and other expenses. Core Portfolio real estate taxes increased 2.4% generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. The increase in Total Portfolio property operating and maintenance expense and real estate taxes is also impacted by acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property revenues, increased 6.1%.       General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased payroll resulting from salary increases and increased public company related expenses.       Interest and related amortization decreased due to lower weighted average outstanding debt balances during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $707.5 million and $738.1 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.4% and 7.2% per annum for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.       Depreciation on corporate assets increased due to fixed asset additions related to information and communication systems. Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs decreased due primarily to the acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties.                                           25  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   LIQUIDITY       As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $1.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $133.8 million available on its line of credit. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing line of credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to working capital.       In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute 95% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains). The following distributions have been declared and/or paid to common stockholders and minority interests since January 1, 1999.

Distributions on the Preferred Units were paid quarterly on the last calendar day of each quarter beginning December 31, 1999. The Company expects to continue to make regular quarterly distributions and has set its 2002 distribution to common stockholders at $1.90 per share per annum.   MORTGAGES AND CREDIT FACILITIES       On October 29, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, fixing the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at approximately 3.7% per annum for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of the swap require monthly settlements on the same dates interest payments are due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133 as herein defined, the interest rate swap will be reflected at market value. The Company believes the swap is a perfectly effective cash flow hedge, under SFAS No. 133 and there will be no effect on net income as a result of the mark-to-market adjustments.       During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company borrowed $46.0 million on its line of credit and paid down $89.7 million on the line of credit. The line of credit bears interest at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus 1.125%.       In July of 2001, the Company paid off three maturing mortgages in the amount of $12.1 million. The payoffs were funded with borrowings on the line of credit.                                         26        On August 3, 2001, the Company entered into a $50.0 million mortgage note (the "Stagecoach Mortgage") collateralized by 7 Properties beneficially owned by MHC Stagecoach, L.L.C. The Stagecoach Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 6.98% per annum, amortizes beginning September 1, 2001 over 10 years and matures August 31, 2011. Proceeds from the financing were used to reduce borrowings on the line of credit by $37.9 million.       On February 24, 2000, the Company entered into mortgage agreements collateralizing two Properties for a total of $14.6 million. The mortgage notes mature on March 1, 2010, amortize beginning March 1, 2000 over 30 years and bear interest at a rate of approximately 8.3% per annum.       On April 3, 2000, the Company extended to April 3, 2002 the maturity of its $100 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of banks with interest only payable monthly at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%. On February 8, 2002, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement with the same group of banks, which extended the Term Loan to August 9, 2005.       On June 30, 2000, the Company obtained $110 million in debt financing consisting of two mortgage notes -- one for $94.3 million and one for $15.7 million -- secured by seven Properties. The proceeds of the financing were used to repay $60 million of mortgage debt secured by the seven Properties, to repay amounts outstanding under the Company's line of credit and for working capital purposes. The Company recorded a $1.0 million extraordinary loss (net of $264,000 allocated to Minority Interests) in connection with the early repayment of the $60 million of mortgage debt.       On August 9, 2000, the Company amended its unsecured line of credit with a bank (the "Credit Agreement") bearing interest at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus 1.125%. Among other things, the amendment lowered the total facility under the Credit Agreement to $150 million and extended the maturity to August 9, 2003. The Company pays a quarterly fee on the average unused amount of such credit equal to 0.15% of such amount. As of December 31, 2001, $133.8 million was available under the Credit Agreement.       Certain of the Company's mortgage and credit agreements contain covenants and restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured debt versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed charges-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), limitations on certain holdings and other restrictions.   ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND INVESTMENTS       On September 4, 1997, the Company entered into a portfolio purchase agreement (as amended by a supplemental agreement on December 17, 1997) to acquire 37 manufactured home communities (the "Ellenburg Communities") from partnerships having Ellenburg Capital Corporation ("ECC") as the general partner, for a purchase price in excess of $300 million. During 1997 and 1998, the Company closed on the acquisition of 31 of the Ellenburg Communities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $278 million and gained control of an additional five Ellenburg Communities with acquisition advances of approximately $57 million to the partnerships which owned such Ellenburg Communities. All fundings related to the acquisition were funded by the Company with borrowings under the Company's line of credit, term bank facilities, assumed debt and the issuance of Common OP Units.       During 1998, the Company received approximately $14.3 million, including approximately $365,000 of interest income, which was being held subject to the completion of due diligence procedures on the Ellenburg Communities. The $14.3 million was initially recorded as a liability until 1999 when a settlement of certain related issues was substantially complete and accordingly, in a non-cash transaction, relieved the liability and adjusted the purchase price of the Ellenburg Communities.       In April 2000, the California Superior Court approved a settlement agreement (the "Settlement") in connection with the dissolution proceeding of ECC and its affiliated partnerships. As part of the Settlement, the Company received $13.5 million previously held in escrow in connection with the purchase of the Ellenburg Communities and recorded $3.0 million of interest income related to these funds. In connection with the Settlement, the Company sold three communities -- Mesa Regal RV Resort, Mon Dak and Naples Estates -- for an aggregate sales price of $59.0 million, including cash proceeds of $40.0 million and assumption of debt by the purchaser of $19.0 million. The Company recorded a $9.1 million gain on the sale of these Properties. Proceeds from the Settlement and property sales were used to pay down the Company's line of credit.                                           27       On January 6, 1998, the Company funded a $12.3 million loan (the "Meadows Loan") to Meadows Preservation, Inc. The Meadows Loan was collateralized by The Meadows manufactured home community located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. On April 1, 1999, the Company effectively exchanged the Meadows Loan for an equity and debt interest in the partnership that owns The Meadows. The Company includes The Meadows in investment in real estate and the related results of operations in the Statement of Operations.       On July 23, 1999, the Company acquired Coquina Crossing, located in St. Augustine, Florida, for a purchase price of approximately $10.4 million. The acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Coquina Crossing is a 748-site senior community with 274 developed sites and zoned expansion potential for 479 sites. In addition, Realty Systems, Inc. ("RSI"), an affiliate of the Company, purchased the model home inventory at the community for approximately $1.1 million.       On February 29, 2000, MHC Systems, Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, disposed of the water and wastewater service company and facilities known as FFEC-Six in a cash sale. Net proceeds from the sale of approximately $4.2 million were used to pay down the Company's line of credit .       On December 28, 2000, the Company, through its joint venture with Meadows Management Company, acquired a 50% economic interest in Voyager RV Resort, a 1,576 site RV resort in Tucson, Arizona, for total consideration of $8.0 million. The Company's investment included cash of $3.0 million, its 50% interest in land held through the joint venture valued at $2.0 million and notes receivable from the principals of Meadows Management Company totaling $3.0 million.       On January 3, 2001, the Company acquired two Florida Properties, totaling 730 sites, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $16.3 million. The Lakes at Countrywood is a 421-site community in Plant City, near Tampa, Florida, and includes approximately 23 acres for expansion. Grand Island is a 309-site community in Grand Island, near Orlando, Florida, and includes a marina with 50 boat docks. The acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.       On February 13, 2001, the Company completed the disposition of seven Properties, totaling 1,281 sites, in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, for a total sale price of approximately $17.4 million. A gain of $8.1 million was recorded on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the amount outstanding on the Company's line of credit.       On October 5, 2001, the Company finalized a settlement agreement between the Lending Partnership, the Operating Partnership and the limited liability partnership which owns Candlelight Village in Columbus, Indiana. In 1996, the Company funded a recourse loan to the owner of Candlelight Village and accounted for the loan as an investment in real estate. The Company received $10.8 million in proceeds from the settlement, which was accounted for as a sale of real estate and recorded a $75,000 gain on the sale. Proceeds from the sale were used as working capital.   CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS       Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as recurring capital expenditures ("Recurring CapEx"), site development costs and corporate headquarters costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $12.7 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Of these expenditures, the Company believes that approximately $7.1 million or $142 per site for 2001 and $6.5 million or $130 per site for 2000 are non-revenue producing improvements which are necessary in order to increase and/or maintain occupancy levels and maintain competitive market rents for new and renewing residents. Site development costs were approximately $9.7 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's Properties.   EQUITY TRANSACTIONS       On March 26, 1999, the Operating Partnership repurchased and cancelled 200,000 OP Units from a limited partner of the Operating Partnership.                                           28       On September 30, 1999, the Operating Partnership completed a $125 million private placement of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Units ("POP Units") to two institutional investors. The POP Units, which are callable by the Company after five years, have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Net proceeds from the offering of $121 million were used to repay amounts outstanding under the Company's line of credit facility and for other corporate purposes.       In March 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase plan whereby the Company was authorized to repurchase and retire shares of its common stock. No shares of Common Stock were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2001. However, under the plan, the Company repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of Common Stock at an average price of $24.06 per share during the year ended December 31, 2000 and 4.1 million shares of Common Stock at an average price of $23.40 per share during the year ended December 31, 1999, using proceeds from borrowings on the line of credit.   INFLATION       Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.   FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS       FFO was redefined by NAREIT in October 1999, effective January 1, 2000, as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REIT's computations. Funds available for distribution ("FAD") is defined as FFO less non-revenue producing capital expenditures and amortization payments on mortgage loan principal. The Company believes that FFO and FAD are useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, they provide investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO and FAD in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.       The following table presents a calculation of FFO and FAD for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 (amounts in thousands):                                                                    2001           2000          1999                                                               --------       --------       -------        COMPUTATION OF FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS:   Income before extraordinary loss on early Extinguishment      of debt................................................  $ 32,083       $ 32,986       $27,772   Income allocated to Common OP Units.......................     8,209          8,463         6,219   Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs........    34,833         34,411        34,486   Gain on sale of Properties and other......................

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF MARKET RISK       The Company's earnings are affected by changes in interest rates, as a portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on LIBOR. The Company's $150 million line of credit ($16.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2001) bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% per annum and the Company's $100 million Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0% per annum. If LIBOR increased/decreased by 1.0% during 2001, interest expense would have increased/decreased by approximately $1.4 million based on the combined average balance outstanding under the Company's line of credit and Term Loan for the year ended December 31, 2001.       In July 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at 6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only of legal costs that were deemed immaterial. The value of the 1998 Swap was impacted by changes in the market rate of interest. Had the 1998 Swap been entered into on December 31, 1999, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have been approximately 6.57%. Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap rate for the 1998 Swap increases or decreases the value of the 1998 Swap versus its current value by approximately $28,000. The Company accounted for the 1998 Swap as a hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap were accounted for as an adjustment to interest expense. On January 10, 2000, the Company unwound the 1998 Swap and received $1.0 million of proceeds which is amortized into interest expense through March 2003.       On October 29, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at approximately 3.7% for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of the swap require monthly settlements on the same dates that interest payments are due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the interest rate swap is reflected at market value. The Company believes the swap is a perfectly effective cash flow hedge per SFAS No. 133 and there will be no effect on net income as a result of the mark-to-market adjustment. The value of the hedge as of December 31, 2001 was approximately $489,000 and is recorded as an asset and included in other assets. Mark-to-market change in the value of the swap are included in other comprehensive income.       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and its amendments, Statements 137 and 138 in June 1999 and June 2000, respectively. SFAS No. 133 permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement No. 137 which deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to all fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
