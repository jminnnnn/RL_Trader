Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations          The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.   2006 Accomplishments                         Approved the sale of Thousand Trails to Privileged Access. Privileged Access is owned by an experienced industry veteran, Joe McAdams, the former CEO of Affinity Group, Inc. with over 18 years experience in the RV industry.                           Acquired 24 membership campground Properties which have been leased to Privileged Access opening up additional access along the East Coast for the Privileged Access members.                           Acquired our outside joint venture partners interest in 15 Properties containing over 6,700 sites, primarily in the important markets of Arizona and Florida.                           First year since 2000 where our manufactured home Properties owned year over year finished the year with a higher number of occupied sites than where we started the year.                           Raised annual dividend to $0.60 per share in 2007, up from $0.30 per share in 2006.                           Successfully refinanced maturing lines of credit and term loan with favorable terms and an increased borrowing capacity.       Overview and Outlook          Occupancy in our Properties as well as our ability to increase rental rates directly affect revenues. Our revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting our sites on a long-term basis.        We have approximately 64,600 annual sites, approximately 8,000 seasonal sites, which are leased to customers generally for 3 to 6 months, and approximately 8,800 transient sites, occupied by customers who lease sites on a short-term basis. We expect to service over 100,000 customers with these transient sites. However, we consider this revenue stream to be our most volatile. It is subject to weather conditions, gas prices, and other factors affecting the marginal RV customers vacation and travel preferences. Finally, we have approximately 24,100 membership sites for which we currently receive ground rent of approximately $19.5 million annually. This rent is classified in Income from other investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also have interests in Properties containing approximately 7,500 sites for which revenue is classified as Equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.                                                                 Total Sites as of Dec. 31,                (rounded to 000s)                2006         2005         Community sites (1)              45,700                   44,900           Resort sites (2):                                              Annual              18,900                   15,500           Seasonal              8,000                   8,000           Transient              8,800                   6,500           Membership (3)              24,100                   17,900           Joint Ventures (4)              7,500                   13,500                                                                         113,000                   106,300                                                                                   (1)         Includes 1,581 and 2,076 sites from discontinued operations as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.           (2)         Includes 100 sites from discontinued operations, subsequently sold in January 2007.           (3)         All sites are currently leased to Privileged Access.           (4)         Joint Venture income is included in Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures.        Supplemental Property Disclosure          We provide the following disclosures with respect to certain assets:                       Sunshine Key   Sunshine Key is a 409-site lifestyle-oriented resort Property containing a 200-slip marina located in the Florida Keys. The Property is an individual 54-acre island. We purchased Sunshine Key for approximately $21 million in February 2004 as part of a larger portfolio. In 2005 and 2006, the Property generated approximately $2.2 million and $2.5 million, in income from its property and home sales operations, respectively. Sunshine Key is owned by a taxable REIT subsidiary. Subject to certain provisions, there are rights to redevelop the Property into 104 attached hotel units, 152 detached hotel units (park models) and 146 RV sites.       28                               We believe that because of the size, quality and location of Sunshine Key, it represents an irreplaceable asset and therefore, would not normally be considered for sale. However, based on unsolicited purchase inquiries, we determined that a sale may be beneficial if we could defer the gain on sale and reinvest the proceeds from the sale into a diversified portfolio of properties meeting our long-term investment criteria, or if we could significantly increase cash flow from the Property by participating in a transaction with a developer where we could retain an interest in the Property through a ground lease structure.                            In November 2005, we entered into a contract to sell Sunshine Key. At the time, we were negotiating for the acquisition of a portfolio that we believed would be an appropriate alternative use of the capital gained from the sale. A provision of the contract allowed us to terminate the contract through June 2006 to the extent we were unable to find appropriate alternative investments. Discussions with respect to a potential replacement portfolio did not lead to a transaction and we communicated such to the potential acquirer of Sunshine Key. In response, the potential acquirer discussed potential alternative transactions with us including, among others the sale of the Property at an increased price, and entering into a long-term ground lease transaction. After consideration, we exercised our right to terminate the contract. The purchase price of the Property under the contract was $70 million.                           Lazy Lakes   Lazy Lakes is a 100-site lifestyle-oriented resort Property located in Sugar Loaf Key, Florida on approximately 13 acres, including an 8-acre lagoon. We purchased Lazy Lakes for approximately $3 million in February 2004 as part of a larger portfolio. The Property generated approximately $170,000 and $85,000 in income from its property and home sales operations in 2005 and 2006, respectively.                            In January, 2007 we sold Lazy Lakes for approximately $8 million resulting in an approximate gain on sale of $5 million. The Property operations appear in Income from discontinued operations for all periods presented.                           Monte Vista   Monte Vista is a lifestyle-oriented resort Property located in Mesa, Arizona containing approximately 56 acres of vacant land. We have obtained approval to develop 275 manufactured home and 240 RV sites on this land. In connection with evaluating the development of Monte Vista, we evaluated selling the land and subsequently decided to list 26 acres of the land for sale. We have received several bids of approximately $10.4 million and are now evaluating those bids. No assurances can be given that any sale transaction will materialize. With respect to the land not listed for sale, we intend to develop additional RV sites and may consider other alternative uses for the land or sale of the acreage. We anticipate that we will proceed with the development if we determine that any offers or the terms thereof are unacceptable.                           Bulow Plantation   Bulow Plantation is a 628-site mixed lifestyle-oriented resort Property and manufactured home community located in Flagler Beach, Florida which contains approximately 180 acres of adjacent vacant land. We have obtained approval for an additional manufactured home community development of approximately 700 sites on this land. In connection with evaluating the possible development and based on inquiries from single-family home developers, we evaluated a sale of the land. Subsequently, we listed the land for sale for a purchase price of $28 million. We anticipate that we will proceed with the development if we determine that any offers or the terms thereof are unacceptable.                           Holiday Village, Florida   Holiday Village is a 128-site manufactured home community located in Vero Beach, Florida, on approximately 20 acres of land. As a result of the 2004 hurricanes, this Property is less than 50% occupied. The residents have been notified that the Property was listed for sale for a purchase price of $6 million.       Privileged Access          Privileged Access is leasing sites at certain of our Properties for the purpose of creating flexible use products. These products may include the sale of timeshare or fractional interests in resort homes or cottages and membership and vacation-club products. Leasing our sites to Privileged Access allows us to participate in these products and activities while achieving long-term rental of our sites. We expect to lease additional sites to Privileged Access for this purpose at other Properties in the future.        On April 14, 2006, Privileged Access acquired our tenant, Thousand Trails (TT). Under the terms of the lease with TT, we consented to the ownership change. In addition, we waived an existing right of first offer due to the relatively accelerated timing of the transaction and the lack of definitive guidance regarding the tax treatment of gross income from membership contracts for REIT gross income test purposes. In connection with the transaction, we acquired two additional Properties for $10 million and amended the lease to include those Properties for a total of 59 Properties and 18,535 sites. The annual lease payment for 2007 increased to approximately $17.9 million. In addition, we entered into an option, subject to certain contingencies, to acquire TT beginning in April of 2009. One of the option contingences requires us to obtain assurance   29           regarding the qualification of the income from membership contracts for REIT income test purposes. In order to facilitate the closing of the transaction, we loaned Privileged Access approximately $12.3 million at a per annum interest rate of prime plus 1.5%, maturing in one year (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K) and secured by approximately $23 million of TT membership sales contract receivables. We financed the acquisition of the additional Properties and the loan with a draw on our existing lines of credit.        On April 25, 2006, we acquired seven lifestyle-oriented Properties (Mid-Atlantic Portfolio) which contain 1,594 sites including 950 acres of developable expansion land and are located in Florida, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, Kentucky and Alabama (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K). The resort sites, which service an existing member base in excess of 7,000 active members, were leased to Privileged Access for a term of approximately one year at $735,000 per annum. We intend to re-lease these sites beyond the expiration of the original lease.        On December 15, 2006, we acquired 15 membership campground resort Properties (Outdoor World Portfolio) which contain 3,962 sites and are located in Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K). The resort sites, which service an existing member base of approximately 24,000 members, were leased to Privileged Access for an annual lease payment of approximately $1 million for an original term expiring in February 2007 and a one month extension option. We intend to re-lease theses sites beyond the initial term.        As of December 31, 2006, we are leasing approximately 24,100 sites at 81 membership campground resort Properties to Privileged Access or its subsidiaries. We expect to continue this type of leasing activity with Privileged Access, as well as exploring other products and services. One example of such a lease is a one-year lease with Privileged Access for 130 sites at Tropical Palms, a Property located near Orlando, Florida, for an annual rate of approximately $1.3 million. Privileged Access intends to sell fractional interests in some resort homes at this Property.   Insurance          Approximately 70 Florida Properties suffered damage from the four hurricanes that struck the state during August and September 2004. As of February 8, 2007, the Company estimates its total claim to be $20.1 million, of which approximately $18.9 million of claims, including business interruption, have been submitted to its insurance companies for reimbursement. Through December 31, 2006, the Company has made total expenditures of approximately $13.8 million and expects to incur additional expenditures to complete the work necessary to restore the Properties to their pre-hurricanes condition. The Company has reserved approximately $2.0 million related to these expenditures ($0.7 million in 2005 and $1.3 million in 2004). Approximately $5.0 million of these expenditures have been capitalized per the Companys capitalization policy through December 31, 2006.        Approximately 33 Properties located in southern Florida were impacted by Hurricane Wilma in October 2005. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $4.4 million of claims have been submitted to the Companys insurance company for reimbursement. Through December 31, 2006, the Company has made total expenditures of approximately $2.5 million and is still evaluating the total costs it expects to incur. Through December 31, 2006, $1.6 million has been charged to operations ($0.3 million in 2006 and $1.3 million in 2005) and $0.6 million was capitalized to fixed assets.        The Company has received proceeds from insurance carriers of approximately $5.6 million through December 31, 2006. Approximately $1.5 million is included in other assets as a receivable from insurance providers as of December 31, 2006, and approximately $3.9 million was included in other assets as of December 31, 2005.   30         Property Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Dispositions          The following chart lists the Properties or portfolios acquired, invested in, or sold since January 1, 2005:                                             Property         Transaction Date         Sites         Total Sites as of January 1, 2005                        102,178                                                Property or Portfolio (# of Properties in parentheses):                                    San Francisco RV (1)         June 20, 2005              182           Morgan Portfolio (5)         August 12, 2005              2,929           Lake George Escape         September 15, 2005              576           Thousand Trails (2)         April 14, 2006              624           Mid-Atlantic Portfolio (7)         April 25, 2006              1,594           Tranquil Timbers (1)         June 13, 2006              270           Outdoor World Portfolio (15)         December 15, 2006              3,962                                                Joint Ventures:                                    Maine Portfolio (3)         April 7, 2005              495           Blazing Star (1)         November 18, 2005              254           Morgan Portfolio (5)         Various, 2006              1,134                                                Expansion Site Development and other:                                    Sites added (reconfigured) in 2005                        113           Sites added (reconfigured) in 2006                        134                                                Dispositions:                                    Five Seasons (1)         November 10, 2005              (390    )      Indian Wells (Joint Venture) (1)         April 18, 2006              (350    )      Forest Oaks (1)         April 25, 2006              (227    )      Windsong (1)         April 25, 2006              (268    )      Blazing Star (Joint Venture) (1)         June 29, 2006              (254    )                                           Total Sites as of December 31, 2006                        112,956                                                       Since December 31, 2004, the gross investment in real estate increased from $2,036 million to $2,337 million as of December 31, 2006, due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period. In addition, we acquired the remaining interests in 15 Properties containing 6,717 sites previously held as joint ventures (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).   Markets          The following table identifies our five largest markets by number of sites and provides information regarding our Properties (excludes membership campground Properties leased to Privileged Access and Properties owned through Joint Ventures).                                                                                                                                                                     Percent of Total      Major         Number of                             Percent of         Property Operating      Market         Properties         Total Sites         Total Sites         Revenues         Florida              80                   34,548                   42.4    %              43.7    %      Arizona              31                   12,028                   14.8    %              12.1    %      California              30                   7,227                   8.9    %              17.6    %      Texas              8                   5,143                   6.3    %              2.3    %      Colorado              10                   3,451                   4.2    %              5.2    %      Other              51                   19,005                   23.3    %              19.1    %                                                                                             Total              210                   81,402                   100.0    %              100.0    %                                                                                               31          Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates          Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.   Long-Lived Assets          In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS No. 141) ,  we allocate the purchase price of Properties we acquire to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective Property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each Property as a result of our due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.        We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.        Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We use a 30-year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life.   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts          Rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue and is recognized over the term of the respective lease or the length of a customers stay, the majority of which are for a term of not greater than one year. We monitor the collectibility of accounts receivable from our tenants on an ongoing basis. We will reserve for receivables when we believe the ultimate collection is less than probable and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded during each period and the associated bad debt expense is included in our property operating and maintenance expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allowance for doubtful accounts is netted against rents receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. Our provision for uncollectible rents receivable was approximately $0.9 million as of December 31, 2006 and $1.2 million as of December 31, 2005.        We may also finance the sale of homes to our customers through loans (referred to as Chattel Loans). The valuation of an allowance for doubtful accounts for the Chattel Loans is calculated based on a comparison of the outstanding principal balance of each note compared to the N.A.D.A. (National Automobile Dealers Association) value and the current market value of the underlying manufactured home collateral. A bad debt expense is recorded in home selling expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allowance for doubtful accounts is netted against the notes and interest receivables on our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for these Chattel Loans as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was $110,000 and $81,000, respectively.   Inventory          Inventory consists of new and used Site Set homes and is stated at the lower of cost or market after consideration of the N.A.D.A. Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide and the current market value of each home included in the home inventory. Inventory sales revenues and resale revenues are recognized when the home sale is closed. Inventory is recorded net of an inventory reserve as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 of $580,000. The expense for the inventory reserve is included in the cost of home sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.   Variable Interest Entities          In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R)  an interpretation of ARB 51. The objective of FIN 46R is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity (VIE) and determine when the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and results of operations of a VIE need to be included in a companys consolidated financial statements. A company that holds variable   32           interests in an entity will need to consolidate such entity if the company absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses or receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns if they occur, or both (i.e., the primary beneficiary). The Company will apply FIN 46R to all types of entity ownership (general and limited partnerships and corporate interests).        The Company will re-evaluate and apply the provisions of FIN 46R to existing entities if certain events occur which warrant re-evaluation of such entities. In addition, the Company will apply the provisions of FIN 46R to all new entities in the future. The Company also consolidates entities in which it has a controlling direct or indirect voting interest. The equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which the Company does not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest, but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions. The cost method is applied when (i) the investment is minimal (typically less than 5%) and (ii) the Companys investment is passive.   Stock-Based Compensation          The valuation of financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments (SFAS No. 107) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Where possible, we base the fair values of our financial instruments, including our derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, we base our estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instrument.        The Company adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the modified prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure.  The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) (SFAS 123(R)), Share Based Payment on July 1, 2005 which did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees, consultants and directors.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements          We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with any unconsolidated investments or joint ventures that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements          In June 2006, FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FAS109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48), to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will adopt FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts as applicable. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a significant impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations.   33         Results of Operations     Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2006 to Year Ended December 31, 2005          The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Property Operations for all Properties owned throughout both periods (Core Portfolio) and the Total Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands).                                                                                                                                                                                         Core Portfolio              Total Portfolio                                                             Increase /                                                                          Increase /                                    2006              2005              (Decrease)              % Change              2006              2005              (Decrease)              % Change              Community base rental income         $    222,767              $    213,280              $    9,487                   4.4    %         $    225,815              $    213,280              $    12,535                   5.9    %      Resort base rental income              74,063                   71,015                   3,048                   4.3    %              89,925                   74,371                   15,554                   20.9    %      Utility and other income              28,831                   27,202                   1,629                   6.0    %              30,643                   27,367                   3,276                   12.0    %                                                                                                                                     Property operating revenues              325,661                   311,497                   14,164                   4.5    %              346,383                   315,018                   31,365                   10.0    %                                                                                                                                                                             Property operating and maintenance              106,382                   102,158                   4,224                   4.1    %              116,179                   103,832                   12,347                   11.9    %      Real estate taxes              24,736                   24,490                   246                   1.0    %              26,246                   24,671                   1,575                   6.4    %      Property management              15,995                   15,392                   603                   3.9    %              17,079                   15,919                   1,160                   7.3    %                                                                                                                                     Property operating expenses              147,113                   142,040                   5,073                   3.6    %              159,504                   144,422                   15,082                   10.4    %                                                                                                                                     Income from property operations         $    178,548              $    169,457              $    9,091                   5.4    %         $    186,879              $    170,596              $    16,283                   9.5    %                                                                                                                                       Property Operating Revenues          The 4.5% increase in the Core Portfolio property operating revenues reflects (i) a 4.4% increase in rates for our community base rental income combined with a 0.1% increase in occupancy, (ii) a 4.3% increase in revenues for our core resort base income, and (iii) an increase in utility income primarily due to the pass-through of higher utility rates. Total Portfolio operating revenues increased due to site rental rate increases and our 2005 and 2006 acquisitions (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).   Property Operating Expenses          The 3.6% increase in property operating expenses for the Core Portfolio reflects a 4.1% increase in property operating and maintenance due primarily to increases in utilities and repair and maintenance. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues. Total Portfolio operating expenses increased due to our 2005 and 2006 acquisitions, as well as increases in utilities and repair and maintenance. Property management expense for the Total Portfolio increased primarily due to 2005 and 2006 acquisitions and payroll increases.   34         Results of Operations (continued)     Home Sales Operations          The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Home Sales Operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands, except sales volumes).                                                                                                         2006              2005              Variance              % Change              Gross revenues from new home sales         $    58,799              $    62,664              $    (3,865    )              (6.2    %)      Cost of new home sales              (52,394    )              (53,899    )              1,505                   2.8    %                                                                         Gross profit from new home sales              6,405                   8,765                   (2,360    )              (26.9    %)                                                                                             Gross revenues from used home sales              2,448                   3,350                   (902    )              (26.9    %)      Cost of used home sales              (2,104    )              (3,572    )              1,468                   41.1    %                                                                         Gross profit (loss) from used home sales              344                   (222    )              566                   255.0    %                                                                                             Brokered resale revenues, net              2,129                   2,714                   (585    )              (21.6    %)      Home selling expenses              (9,836    )              (8,838    )              (998    )              (11.3    %)      Ancillary services revenues, net              3,027                   2,227                   800                   35.9    %                                                                                                                                                                Income from home sales operations         $    2,069              $    4,646              $    (2,577    )              (55.5    %)                                                                                                                                                                Home sales volumes:                                                                                      New home sales (1)              783                   771                   12                   1.6    %      Used home sales (2)              370                   271                   99                   36.5    %      Brokered home resales              1,255                   1,526                   (271    )              (17.8    %)                               (1)         Includes third party home sales of 79 and 84 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.           (2)         Includes third party home sales of 13 and zero for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.             New home sales gross profit reflects a decrease in the gross margin. Used home sales gross profit reflects higher gross margin per home and higher volumes. Brokered resale revenues reflect decreased resale volumes. The increase in home selling expenses relates primarily to advertising. The increase in ancillary service revenue relates primarily to our acquisitions.

This note will mature in April 2007.        Income from other investments, net increased due to: the previously discussed increase in ground lease activity with Privileged Access, corporate expense savings of $0.9 million, one-time gains including a $1.0 million non-refundable deposit received upon termination of the contract for the sale of Del Rey (see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K) and a $0.9 million gain on sale of our preferred partnership interest in College Heights. This investment was previously classified as other assets. These increases were offset by a write-off of costs related to potential transactions no longer being considered of $0.9 million.      35         Results of Operations (continued)          General and administrative expense decreased due to decreased legal costs and banking fees, partially offset by an increase in payroll. Interest and related amortization increased due to acquisitions offset by a decrease in our average interest rates due to refinancings in 2005.        Loss on early debt retirement decreased due to transaction costs on early debt retirement related to refinancings in 2005 (see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).        Depreciation on corporate assets decreased as a result of assets being fully depreciated. Depreciation on real estate increased $4.7 million primarily relating to acquisitions.   Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures          For the year ended December 31, 2006, equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $2.9 million primarily due to the purchase of the remaining interest in the Mezzanine Properties in the first quarter of 2006 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources  Investing Activities), as well as distributions received in 2005 from three joint ventures relating to debt refinancings by the ventures. Two of these distributions exceeded the Companys basis and therefore were included in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in 2005. These decreases are partially offset by the net gain on sale of the property owned by the Indian Wells joint venture.

Total Portfolio operating revenues increased due to current year acquisitions and 2004 acquisitions owned for the full year in 2005 (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).   Property Operating Expenses          The 6.2% increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in administrative expense, utility expense increases greater than CPI, and increased insurance expenses. The 4.4% increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes is generally due to higher property tax assessments on certain Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues, increased due to payroll costs, but remained at approximately 4% of revenue. Property management expense for the Total Portfolio increased primarily due to overall Company growth and new marketing initiatives. Total Portfolio operating expenses increased due to our current year acquisitions and 2004 acquisitions owned for the full year in 2005.   36         Results of Operations (continued)     Home Sales Operations          The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Home Sales Operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in thousands, except sales volumes).                                                                                                         2005              2004              Variance              % Change              Gross revenues from new home sales         $    62,664              $    43,324              $    19,340                   44.6    %      Cost of new home sales              (53,899    )              (38,067    )              (15,832    )              (41.6    %)                                                                         Gross profit from new home sales              8,765                   5,257                   3,508                   66.7    %                                                                                             Gross revenues from used home sales              3,350                   4,080                   (730    )              (17.9    %)      Cost of used home sales              (3,572    )              (3,510    )              (62    )              (1.8    %)                                                                         Gross (loss) profit from used home sales              (222    )              570                   (792    )              (138.9    %)                                                                                             Brokered resale revenues, net              2,714                   2,176                   538                   24.7    %      Home selling expenses              (8,838    )              (8,630    )              (208    )              (2.4    %)      Ancillary services revenues, net              2,227                   2,280                   (53    )              (2.3    %)                                                                                                                                                                Income from home sales operations         $    4,646              $    1,653              $    2,993                   181.1    %                                                                                                                                                                Home sales volumes:                                                                                      New home sales (1)              771                   514                   257                   50.0    %      Used home sales              271                   341                   (70    )              (20.5    %)      Brokered home resales              1,526                   1,415                   111                   7.8    %                               (1)         Includes third party home sales of 84 and 0 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.             New home sales gross profit reflects a 50% increase in sales volume combined with an increase in average selling price of approximately $7,000 per home or approximately 8%.

Depreciation on real estate increased $8.1 million relating to the full year effect in 2005 of our 2004 acquisitions. These are partially offset by increased income from other investments, net that includes approximately $16.1 million of lease income from the Thousand Trails ground lease entered into on November 10, 2004.   38         Results of Operations (continued)     Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures          During 2005, we received distributions from three joint ventures relating to debt refinancings by the ventures. Two of these distributions exceeded the Companys basis and therefore were included in the income from unconsolidated joint ventures. Our 2005 acquisitions and the full year effect of our 2004 acquisitions also contributed to the increase.   Liquidity and Capital Resources     Liquidity          As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $1.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $143.8 million available on its lines of credit. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing lines of credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under its existing lines of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to net cash provided by operating activities. The table below summarizes cash flow activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in thousands).                                                                                     For the twelve months ended                     December 31,                     2006              2005              2004              Cash provided by operating activities         $    99,457              $    90,326              $    46,733           Cash used in investing activities              (67,086    )              (66,246    )              (366,654    )      Cash used in financing activities              (31,376    )              (28,775    )              (514    )                                                          Net increase (decrease) in cash         $    995              $    (4,695    )         $    (320,435    )                                                            Operating Activities          Net cash provided by operating activities increased $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. As discussed in Results of Operations above, this increase reflects increases in property operating income and income from other investments, net, offset by an increase in interest expense and a decrease in home sales. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $46.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase reflects increased property operating income as discussed in Results of Operations above and a decrease in working capital.   Investing Activities          Net cash used in investing activities reflects the impact of the following investing activities:   Acquisitions     2006 Acquisitions          During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following transactions:                       Purchased the remaining interest in the Mezzanine Properties (the Mezzanine Portfolio) in which we had initially invested approximately $30.0 million to acquire preferred equity interests during the first quarter of 2004. The Mezzanine Portfolio consists of 11 Properties containing 5,057 sites: five Properties are located in Arizona, four in Florida, and one each in North Carolina and South Carolina. The total purchase price was approximately $105.0 million, including our existing investment in these Properties of $32.2 million and our general partnership investment of $1.4 million. The acquisition was funded by new debt financing of $47.1 million and assumed debt of approximately $25.9 million. Net working capital acquired included $3.2 million of rents received in advance and $0.4 million in other net payables. In connection with this acquisition we also purchased $1.9 million of inventory.      39                 Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)                         Purchased seven membership campground Properties (Mid-Atlantic Portfolio) which contain 1,594 sites including 950 acres of developable expansion land and are located in Florida, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, Kentucky and Alabama. The total purchase price of approximately $14.3 million was funded by the exchange of two all-age Properties, located in Indiana, previously held for sale containing 495 sites, and $5.0 million in cash. We provided short-term seller financing of $3.4 million. This note has been repaid in full. Net working capital acquired included $0.6 million of rents received in advance. The acquisition was funded from our lines of credit.                           Purchased two additional Thousand Trails Properties, located in California and Florida, and certain personal property for $10.0 million. These Properties were leased back as part of the amended TT lease (see Privileged Access discussion above). The acquisition was funded from our lines of credit.                           Purchased Tranquil Timbers, a Property located in Door County, Wisconsin, containing 270 sites for a total purchase price of $2.8 million. The acquisition was funded from our lines of credit.                           Purchased 15 Membership Campground Properties (Outdoor World Portfolio) which contain 3,962 sites and are located in Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The total purchase price of approximately $10 million was funded from our lines of credit.                           Purchased the remaining 75% interest in four Diversified joint venture Properties in which we had an existing 25% joint venture ownership interest. The gross purchase price was approximately $20.5 million and we assumed debt of $12.8 million. Net working capital acquired included $1.2 million of rents received in advance and $0.6 million of escrow deposits.            Certain purchase price adjustments may be made within one year following the acquisitions.   2005 Acquisitions          During the year ended December 31, 2005, we acquired seven Properties (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K). The combined real estate investment in these Properties was approximately $89.9 million and was funded with money drawn from our lines of credit and debt assumed of $53.5 million. We also assumed approximately $5.4 million in escrow deposits and $4.0 million of rents received in advance as a result of these acquisitions.   2004 Acquisitions          During the year ended December 31, 2004, we acquired 111 Properties. The combined investment in real estate for these 111 Properties was approximately $703 million and was funded with monies held in short-term investments, debt assumed of $352 million which includes a mark-to-market adjustment of $10.4 million, new financing of $124 million, and borrowings from our lines of credit. Included in the above as previously described are 57 Properties purchased as part of the Thousand Trails Transaction; the income related to this transaction is classified as Income from other investments, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.        We assumed inventory of approximately $1.2 million, other assets of $4.9 million, rents received in advance of approximately $13.6 million and other liabilities of approximately $5.8 million in connection with the 2004 acquisitions. The Company also issued common OP Units for value of approximately $32.2 million.        We continue to look at acquiring additional assets and are at various stages of negotiations with respect to potential acquisitions. Funding is expected to be provided by either proceeds from potential dispositions, lines of credit draws, or other financing.   Dispositions          During the year ended December 31, 2006, we exchanged two Properties located in Indiana as part of the Mid-Atlantic Portfolio acquisition discussed above. We recorded a loss on sale for this transaction of $0.2 million.        During the year ended December 31, 2005, we sold one Property located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa for a selling price of $6.7 million. Net proceeds of $6.3 million were used to repay amounts outstanding on our lines of credit. A gain on sale of approximately $2.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2005.   40         Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)          During the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold one Property located in Lake Placid, Florida for a selling price of $3.4 million, with net proceeds of $0.8 million received in July 2004. No gain or loss on disposition was recognized in the period. In addition, we sold approximately 1.4 acres of land in Montana for a gain and net proceeds of $0.6 million.        We currently have four all-age Properties held for disposition and are in various stages of negotiations for sale. We plan to reinvest the sale proceeds or reduce outstanding lines of credit. On January 10, 2007, we sold Lazy Lakes, a 100 site resort Property in the Florida Keys for proceeds of $8 million and an approximate gain of $5 million.        The operating results of all properties sold or held for disposition have been reflected in the discontinued operations of the Consolidated Statements of Operations contained in this Form 10-K.   Notes Receivable Activity          On April 14, 2006, in connection with Privileged Access purchase of TT (see Privileged Access discussion above) the Company loaned Privileged Access $12.3 million. This loan is secured by the net contract receivables owned by Privileged Access. The note receivable bears interest at a per annum rate of prime plus 1.5% and matures on April 14, 2007. The note contains certain quarterly covenants. On August 21, 2006, the seller financing of $3.4 million provided in connection with the Mid-Atlantic Portfolio acquisition described above was repaid.   Investments in and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures          During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company invested approximately $1.1 million in five joint ventures owning five Properties located in Florida, Massachusetts, Maine and two in Virginia. The Company also invested approximately $1.6 million in developing one of the Bar Harbor joint venture Properties, which resulted in an increase of the Companys ownership interest per the joint venture agreement.        During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company received approximately $5.1 million in distributions from our joint ventures. $3.5 million of these distributions were classified as return on capital and were included in operating activities. The remaining distributions of approximately $1.6 million were classified as a return of capital and were included in investing activities and related to our sale of the Property owned by the Indian Wells joint venture and the sale of our interest in the Blazing Star joint venture.        During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company invested approximately $7.0 million for a 50% preferred joint venture interest in three Properties located near Bar Harbor, Maine. The Company also invested approximately $0.6 million for a 40% interest in a Texas Property owned by a joint venture controlled by Diversified Investments, Inc (Diversified).        During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company received approximately $11.3 million in distributions from our joint ventures. $5.8 million of these distributions were classified as return on capital and were included in operating activities. The remaining distributions of approximately $5.5 million were classified as a return of capital, were included in investing activities, and related to refinancings at three of our joint venture Properties.        During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company invested approximately $29.7 million in preferred equity interests in six entities controlled by Diversified (the Mezzanine Investment). These entities owned in the aggregate 11 Properties, containing 5,057 sites. Approximately $11.7 million of the Mezzanine Investment accrued at a per annum average rate of 10%, with a minimum pay rate of 6.5% per annum, and approximately $17.9 million of the Mezzanine Investment accrued at a per annum average rate of 11%, with a minimum pay rate of 7% per annum. As discussed above, on March 22, 2006, we acquired the remaining interests in these Properties.        During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company invested approximately $4.1 million in 11 joint ventures controlled by Diversified. The joint venture agreements included terms to allow the Company to purchase these Properties on various dates. As previously discussed, during the fourth quarter of 2006 we acquired four of these Properties. An additional Property was purchased in January 2007.        In addition, the Company recorded approximately $3.6 million, $6.5 million and $3.7 million of net income from joint ventures, net of $1.9 million, $2.0 million and $1.2 million of depreciation, in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.        Due to the Companys inability to control the joint ventures, the Company accounts for its investment in the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.   41               Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)    Proceeds from sale of investment          During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company sold its preferred partnership interest in College Heights for approximately $9.0 million. At the time of the sale, College Heights owned a portfolio of 11 Properties with approximately 1,900 sites located in Michigan, Ohio and Florida. The proceeds received represent a per site value of approximately $22,000.   Capital improvements          Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as recurring capital expenditures (Recurring CapEx), site development costs and corporate costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $14.6 million, $15.9 million and $13.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in Recurring CapEx for the years ended 2006 and 2005 is approximately $2.0 million and $3.4 million of costs incurred to replace hurricane damaged assets. Site development costs were approximately $17.3 million, $16.2 million and $13.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Companys Properties and costs for improvements to sites when a smaller used home is replaced with a larger new home. Corporate costs such as computer hardware, office furniture and office improvements and expansion were $0.3 million, $0.8 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   Financing Activities          Net cash used in financing activities reflects the impact of the following:   Mortgages and Credit Facilities     Financing, Refinancing and Early Debt Retirement     2006 Activity          During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company completed the following transactions:                       Assumed $25.9 million in mortgage debt on four of the eleven Properties related to the acquisition of the Mezzanine Portfolio. During the second and third quarters of 2006, this mortgage debt was defeased. Net proceeds of approximately $10.4 million were used to pay down the lines of credit. The four mortgages bear interest at weighted average interest rates ranging from 5.69% to 6.143% per annum and mature in 2016. In addition, we financed $47.1 million of mortgage debt to acquire the remaining seven Properties in the Mezzanine Portfolio. The seven mortgages bear interest at weighted average rates ranging from 5.70% to 5.72% per annum, and mature in April 2016.                           Received $3.0 million and $2.9 million in mortgage debt proceeds as a result of meeting certain operational criteria at the Monte Vista Property and the Viewpoint Property, respectively. These proceeds were used to pay down the lines of credit.                           Renewed our unsecured debt. We replaced the term loan which had a remaining balance of $100 million maturing in 2007, and a $110 million line of credit maturing in August 2006 with a $225 million line of credit with a four-year maturity and one-year extension option. The new facility bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.20% per annum with a 0.15% facility fee per annum. The interest rate on the term loan was LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum and the $110 million line of credit had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.65% and had a 0.15% unused fee, both per annum. The interest rate on $75 million of the outstanding balance on the new lines of credit is fixed at 6.38% per annum through mid-December 2007. We also renewed our $50 million line of credit which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.20% per annum with a 0.20% facility fee per annum, and matures on June 29, 2010. The renewal increases our financial flexibility and lowers our credit spread.                           Acquired for $2.4 million land formerly subject to a ground lease previously classified as mortgage debt relating to the Golden Terrace South Property.                           Assumed $12.8 million in mortgage debt in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interests in four Diversified Properties. The four mortgages have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.5% per annum and a weighted average maturity of three years.      42                 Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)     2005 Activity          During the third quarter of 2005, the Company refinanced two mortgage loans for proceeds of $34 million at an interest rate of 4.95% per annum. Net proceeds were used to pay down approximately $20 million in other secured financing maturing in 2006.        On December 2, 2005, the Company refinanced approximately $293 million of secured debt maturing in 2007 with an effective interest rate of 6.8% per annum. This debt was secured by two cross-collateralized loan pools consisting of 35 Properties. The transaction generated approximately $337 million in proceeds from loans secured by individual mortgages on 20 Properties. The blended interest rate on the refinancing was approximately 5.3% per annum and the loans mature in 2015. Transaction costs were approximately $20.0 million ($0.67 per fully diluted share) and are classified as loss on early debt retirement on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining excess proceeds were used to repay outstanding amounts on our lines of credit. This transaction strengthened the Companys balance sheet by extending the weighted average years to maturity by approximately two years.        During the third quarter of 2005, in connection with its acquisitions, the Company assumed mortgage debt of approximately $53.5 million at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.9% per annum.   2004 Activity          In 2004, the Company assumed mortgage and other debt relating to acquisitions of approximately $157 million. The Company borrowed an additional $194 million of mortgage debt for other acquisitions. The mortgages bear interest at weighted average rates ranging from 5.14% to 5.81% per annum, and mature at various dates through November 1, 2027. In addition, in connection with the Thousand Trails Transaction, we secured a $120 million three-year term loan at LIBOR plus 1.75%. As noted above, in 2006, the term loan was replaced by a renewal of our unsecured lines of credit.   Secured Debt          As of December 31, 2006, our secured long-term debt balance was approximately $1.6 billion, with a weighted average interest rate in 2006 of approximately 6.1% per annum. The debt bears interest at rates between 4.96% and 9.25% per annum and matures on various dates mainly ranging from 2007 to 2016, with one additional loan maturing in 2027. Included in our debt balance are three capital leases with an imputed interest rate of 11.6% per annum. We do not have any significant long-term debt maturing in 2007 or 2008, with $205 million being the maximum amount maturing in any of the succeeding 5 years beginning in 2008. The weighted average term to maturity for the long-term debt is approximately 6.5 years.   Unsecured Debt          We have two unsecured lines of credit of $225 million and $50 million which bear interest at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus 1.20% per annum and a 0.15% facility fee and 0.20% facility fee, respectively. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2006, we borrowed $193.6 million and paid down $200.1 million on our lines of credit. The weighted average interest rate in 2006 for our unsecured debt was approximately 6.3% per annum. The balance outstanding as of December 31, 2006 was $131.2 million. In December 2006, we fixed one-year LIBOR on $75 million of our outstanding lines of credit balance. As of February 15, 2007, approximately $162 million is available to be drawn on these combined lines of credit.   43         Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)     Other Loans          During 2006, the Company borrowed $3.6 million to finance its insurance premium payments. As of December 31, 2006, $0.3 million remained outstanding. This loan has been paid off. We are currently assessing our financing options for the 2007 insurance year.        Certain of the Companys mortgages and credit agreements contain covenants and restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured debt versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed charges-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), limitations on certain holdings and other restrictions.   Contractual Obligations          As of December 31, 2006, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below (dollars in thousands):                                                                                                                                                           Contractual                                                                            Obligations         Total         2007(2)         2008         2009         2010(3)         2011         Thereafter         Long Term Borrowings (1)         $    1,711,819              $    38,228              $    202,434              $    85,925              $    359,572              $    65,136              $    960,524           Weighted average interest rates              6.09    %              7.15    %              5.65    %              6.87    %              6.79    %              6.97    %              5.71    %                               (1)         Balance excludes net premiums and discounts of $5.4 million.           (2)         Includes principal amortizations and one loan maturing in November 2007 for approximately $20 million. We are currently assessing our refinancing options for this loan.           (3)         Includes lines of credit repayments in 2010 of $131 million. We have an option to extend this maturity for one year to 2011.             Included in the above table are certain capital lease obligations totaling approximately $6.5 million. These agreements expire June 2009 and are paid semi-annually at an imputed interest rate of 11.6% per annum.        The Company does not include preferred OP Unit distributions, interest expense, insurance, property taxes and cancelable contracts in the contractual obligations table above.        The Company also leases land under non-cancelable operating leases at certain of the Properties expiring in various years from 2008 to 2032, with terms which require twelve equal payments per year plus additional rents calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, ground lease rent was approximately $1.6 million per year. Minimum future rental payments under the ground leases are approximately $1.6 million per year for each of the next five years and approximately $20.7 million thereafter.        With respect to maturing debt, the Company has staggered the maturities of its long-term mortgage debt over an average of approximately 7 years, with no more than $600 million in principal maturities coming due in any single year. The Company believes that it will be able to refinance its maturing debt obligations on a secured or unsecured basis; however, to the extent the Company is unable to refinance its debt as it matures, it believes that it will be able to repay such maturing debt from asset sales and/or the proceeds from equity issuances. With respect to any refinancing of maturing debt, the Companys future cash flow requirements could be impacted by significant changes in interest rates or other debt terms, including required amortization payments.   44         Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)     Equity Transactions          In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute 90% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) to its stockholders. The following regular quarterly distributions have been declared and paid to common stockholders and minority interests since January 1, 2004.                                             Distributions         For the Quarter         Stockholder                Per Share         Ending         Record Date         Payment Date         $0.0125         March 31, 2004         March 26, 2004         April 9, 2004      $0.0125         June 30, 2004         June 25, 2004         July 9, 2004      $0.0125         September 30, 2004         September 24, 2004         October 8, 2004      $0.0125         December 31, 2004         December 31, 2004         January 14, 2005             $0.0250         March 31, 2005         March 25, 2005         April 8, 2005      $0.0250         June 30, 2005         June 24, 2005         July 8, 2005      $0.0250         September 30, 2005         September 30, 2005         October 14, 2005      $0.0250         December 31, 2005         December 30, 2005         January 13, 2006             $0.0750         March 31, 2006         March 31, 2006         April 14, 2006      $0.0750         June 30, 2006         June 30, 2006         July 14, 2006      $0.0750         September 30, 2006         September 29, 2006         October 13, 2006      $0.0750         December 31, 2006         December 29, 2006         January 12, 2007        2006 Activity          On November 7, 2006, the Company announced that in 2007 the annual distribution per common share will be $0.60 per share up from $0.30 per share in 2006 and $0.10 per share in 2005. This decision recognizes the Companys investment opportunities and the importance of its dividend to its stockholders.        On December 29, 2006, September 29, 2006, June 30, 2006 and March 31, 2006, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 8.0625% per annum on the $150 million of Series D 8% Units and 7.95% per annum on the $50 million of Series F 7.95% Units.        During the year ended December 31, 2006, we received approximately $3.8 million in net proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan.   2005 Activity          The 2006 annual distribution per common share was $0.30 per share, up from $0.10 per share in 2005 and $0.05 per share in 2004.        On March 24, 2005, the Operating Partnership issued $25 million of 8.0625% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Units (the Series D 8% Units), to institutional investors. The Series D 8% Units are non-callable for five years. In addition, the Operating Partnership had an existing $125 million of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Units (the Series D 9% Units) outstanding that were callable by the Company as of September 2004. In connection with the new issue, the Operating Partnership agreed to extend the non-call provision of the Series D 9% Units to be coterminous with the new issue, and the institutional investors holding the Series D 9% Units agreed to lower the rate on such units to 8.0625%. All of the units have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit.        On June 30, 2005, the Operating Partnership issued $50 million of 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Units (the Series F Units), to institutional investors. The Series F Units are non-callable for five years and have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit.        On March 24, 2005, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 9.0% per annum on the $125 million of Series D 9% Units. For the seven days ended March 31, 2005 and the nine months thereafter, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 8.0625% per annum on the $150 million of Series D 8% Units. For the six months ended December 31, 2005, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 7.95% per annum on the $50 million of Series F Units. Distributions on the Units were paid quarterly on the last calendar day of each quarter.   45         Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)          During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received approximately $4.0 million in net proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan.   2004 Activity          During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, in connection with its 2004 acquisitions the Company issued 1.2 million common OP Units valued at $36.7 million, of which approximately $28.7 million has been classified as paid-in capital. On December 21, 2004, we redeemed 126,765 common OP Units for approximately $4.5 million, of which approximately $3.5 million has been classified as paid-in capital.        During the year ended December 31, 2004, we received approximately $4.9 million in net proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan.   Inflation          Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation to the Company. In addition, our resort Properties are not generally subject to leases and rents are established for these sites on an annual basis.   Funds From Operations          Funds from Operations (FFO) is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe FFO, as defined by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be an appropriate measure of performance for an equity REIT. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity REITs, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance.        FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of Properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. We further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income and cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, when evaluating an equity REITs operating performance. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.   46         Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)          The following table presents a calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in thousands):                                                                                     2006              2005              2004              Computation of funds from operations:                                                                  Net income (loss) available for Common Shares         $    16,632              $    (2,333    )         $    4,026           Income (loss) allocated to Common OP Units              4,318                   (539    )              936           Depreciation on real estate assets              60,276                   55,608                   47,467           Depreciation expense included in discontinued operations              84                   410                   1,427           Depreciation expense included in equity in income from joint ventures              1,909                   1,960                   1,230           Gain on sale of Properties              (852    )              (2,279    )              (638    )                                                          Funds from operations available for Common Shares         $    82,367              $    52,827              $    54,448                                                                                                                                  Weighted average Common Shares outstanding  fully diluted              30,241                   29,927                   29,465                                                                    Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk          Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates. The primary market risk we face is long-term indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our long-term debt obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2006, approximately 96% or approximately $1.6 billion of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates, which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures. For each increase in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately $99.3 million. For each decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total outstanding debt would increase by approximately $106.1 million.        At December 31, 2006, approximately 4% or approximately $75.8 million of our outstanding debt was short-term and at variable rates. Earnings are affected by increases and decreases in market interest rates on this debt. For each increase/decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), our earnings would increase/decrease by approximately $0.8 million annually.   47            FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS          This report includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
