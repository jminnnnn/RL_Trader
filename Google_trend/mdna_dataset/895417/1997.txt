ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995       Since December 31, 1995, the gross investment in rental property has increased from $543 million to $598 million due to the acquisition of Waterford on February 28, 1996, the funding of the Candlelight Village loan, which was accounted for as a purchase, on May 9, 1996, and the acquisition of Casa del Sol Resort No. 1 and Casa del Sol Resort No. 2 (collectively, the "Casa del Sol Resorts") on October 23, 1996.  The total number of sites increased from 25,552 as of December 31, 1995 to 27,356 as of December 31, 1996.       The following table summarizes certain weighted average occupancy statistics for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995.  "Core Portfolio" represents an analysis of properties owned during both periods of comparison.                                   Core Portfolio    Total Portfolio                              --------------    ---------------                              1996     1995      1996      1995                              ----     ----      ----      ----          Total sites                  25,554   25,375    26,621    25,375 Occupied sites               24,098   23,787    25,025    23,787 Occupancy %                   94.3%    93.7%     94.0%     93.7% Monthly base rent per site     $312     $297      $310      $297        Base rental income ($93.1 million) increased $7.9 million or 9.2%.  For the Core Portfolio, base rental income increased approximately $5.4 million or 6.3%, reflecting a 5.0% increase in base rental rates and a 1.3% increase related to occupancy.  Base rental income at Waterford, Candlelight Village and the Casa del Sol Resorts (collectively, the "1996 Acquisitions") was approximately $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  Partially offsetting this increase was a $502,000 decrease in base rental income resulting from the sale of two properties in 1995.       Monthly base rent per site for the total portfolio increased 4.4% reflecting a 5.0% increase in the Core Portfolio, partially offset by lower monthly base rents for the 1996 Acquisitions.  Average monthly base rent per site for the 1996 Acquisitions was $270.       Weighted average occupancy increased 0.4% primarily due to increased occupancy at the expansion communities.       Utility and other income ($8.8 million) increased $340,000 or 4% primarily due to increased utility income and real estate tax pass-on income.       Interest income ($2.4 million) increased $124,000 or 5%, primarily due to interest earned on the employee notes granted on January 2, 1996, partially offset by a decrease in interest earned on short-term investments.  Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 of approximately $3.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 5.4% in both years.       Property operating and maintenance expenses ($28.4 million) increased $1.3 million or 5%.  The 1996 Acquisitions comprised $826,000 of this increase, partially offset by a decrease in expense of $171,000 resulting from the sale of two properties in 1995. The remaining $687,000, or 2.5%, increase was primarily due to an increase in utility expense of approximately $586,000, an increase in insurance and other expenses of approximately $275,000, and an increase in repairs and maintenance of $91,000, partially offset by a decrease in property payroll of $216,000 and property general and administrative ("G&A) expense of $49,000. Property operating and maintenance expenses represented 27.0% of total revenues in 1996 and 27.9% in 1995.                                         16         17      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)       COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 (CONTINUED)       Real estate taxes ($7.9 million) increased $706,000 or 10% due to the expected increase in assessed values at certain Properties in 1996.  Real estate taxes represented 7.6% of total revenues in 1996 and 7.5% in 1995.       Property management expenses ($4.3 million) decreased $337,000 or 7%.  The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in management company payroll as a result of the staffing reductions in 1995.  Property management expenses represented 4.1% of total revenues in 1996 and 4.8% in 1995.       G&A expenses ($4.0 million) decreased $475,000 or 11%.  The Company has continued to focus on reducing G&A expenses and, as a result these costs have decreased significantly in 1996.  In addition, professional fees decreased resulting from the write-off in 1995 of legal due diligence and related costs associated with acquisitions which did not materialize.  G&A expenses represented 3.9% of total revenues in 1996 and 4.7% in 1995.       Interest expense and related amortization ($17.8 million) decreased by $745,000 or 4%.  Interest expense decreased $13,000 due to a decrease in the interest rate on the Mortgage Debt resulting from the interest rate swap agreement entered into in December 1995 (see discussion below), partially offset by an increase in interest on the line of credit resulting from additional borrowings in 1996.  The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 were $234.9 million and $228.4 million, respectively.  The effective interest rates were 7.2% and 7.6% for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Amortization decreased $732,000 due to the write-off in 1995 of approximately $385,000 of loan costs related to the $50 million line of credit with General Electric Credit Corp. ("GECC") which expired in March 1995.  In addition, the Company sold a portion of the interest rate cap on the Mortgage Debt related to 1996 which decreased amortization in 1996.  Interest expense and related amortization represented 16.9% of total revenues in 1996 and 19.1% in 1995.       The Company has an interest rate cap for the term of the Mortgage Debt which eliminates exposure to increases in LIBOR over 6%, plus 1.05%.  In connection with various swap agreements, discussed below, the Company sold portions of the interest rate cap related to 1996 and 1997 and recorded a non-cash write-off of approximately $650,000 in the fourth quarter of 1995 and $482,000 in the fourth quarter of 1996.       In December 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement fixing the LIBOR rate on the Mortgage Debt at 5.24% effective January 10, 1996 through January 10, 1997.  The value of this agreement is impacted by changes in the market rate of interest.  Had the agreement been entered into on December 31, 1996, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have been 5.6%.  Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap rate for this agreement increases or decreases the value of the agreement entered into by the Company versus its current value by approximately $850.       In October 1996, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement fixing LIBOR on the Mortgage Debt at 5.57% effective January 10, 1997 through March 3, 1998.  The value of this agreement is impacted by changes in the market rate of interest.  Had the agreement been entered into on December 31, 1996, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have been 5.8%.  Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap rate for this agreement increases or decreases the value of the agreement entered into by the Company versus its current value by approximately $2,300.       In July 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "Swap") beginning at the maturity of the Mortgage Debt fixing LIBOR on the refinancing of the Mortgage Debt at 6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003.  The cost of the Swap consisted only of legal costs which were deemed immaterial. In the event that the Company does not refinance the Mortgage Debt, the risk associated with the Swap is that the Company would be obligated to perform its obligations under the terms of the Swap or would have to pay to terminate the Swap.  In either event, the impact of such transaction would be reflected in the Company's statement of operations.  The value of the Swap is impacted by changes in the market rate of interest.  Had the Swap been entered into on December 31, 1996, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have been 6.6%.  Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap rate for the Swap increases or decreases the value of the Swap entered into by the Company versus its current value by approximately $40,000.                                           17         18      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)       COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 (CONTINUED)       On May 7, 1996, the Company amended its credit agreement on the $50.0 million line of credit ("Credit Facility") increasing the Credit Facility to $100.0 million at LIBOR plus 1.375% and extending the maturity date to August 17, 1998.  In addition, the fee on the average unused amount was reduced to 0.15% of such amount from 0.25%.  The Company repaid $4.0 million under the Credit Facility on January 27, 1997.       Depreciation expense and other costs ($15.7 million) increased $390,000 or 2% as a result of the 1996 Acquisitions.  In addition, the Company sold a portion of the interest rate cap on the Mortgage Debt related to 1996 and 1997 and incurred non-cash charges of $482,000 and $650,000 in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Depreciation expense represented 14.5% of total revenues in 1996 and 15.6% in 1995.       COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994       The gross investment in rental property remained relatively stable at $543 million as of December 31, 1995 when compared to $542 million as of December 31, 1994.  The total number of sites decreased from 25,860 as of December 31, 1994 to 25,552 as of December 31, 1995 due to the sale of two properties in 1995.  The acquisition of 23 Properties in 1994 (the "1994 Acquisitions") increased rental income, property operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, depreciation, and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1995 when compared to the year ended December 31, 1994.       The following table summarizes certain weighted average occupancy statistics for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994.  "Core Portfolio" represents an analysis of properties owned during both periods of comparison.                                    Core Portfolio        Total Portfolio                              --------------     -----------------------                              1995     1994      1995             1994                              ----     ----      ----             ----          Total sites                  14,029   13,947    25,375           19,161 Occupied sites               12,932   12,815    23,786           17,792 Occupancy %                    92.2%    91.9%     93.7%            92.9% Monthly base rent per site  $   270  $   258   $   300          $   277        Base rental income ($85.2 million) increased $25.2 million or 42%.  For the Core Portfolio, base rental income increased approximately $2.3 million or 5.8%, reflecting a 4.8% increase in base rental rates and a 1.0% increase in occupancy.  For the 1994 Acquisitions, base rental income increased approximately $23.4 million.  Partially offsetting this increase was the impact of an approximate $518,000 decrease in base rental income resulting from the sale of three properties in 1994 and two properties in 1995.       The 8% increase in monthly base rent per site for the total portfolio was due to the increase in base rents for the Core Portfolio discussed above, as well as the full year impact of the 1994 Acquisitions which had higher base rents than the Core Portfolio. Average monthly rental income for the 1994 Acquisitions was $335 compared to $270 for the Core Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 1995.       The 0.9% increase in the occupancy percentage for the total portfolio was due to improved occupancy in the Southeastern Region as a result of increased occupancy of expansion sites in that region, increased occupancy in the Rocky Mountain Region at a majority of the Properties in that region, including Carriage Park which suffered a decrease in occupancy in 1993 as a result of flooding, and an increase in occupancy in the Western Region as a result of the sale of Catalina which was 64% occupied.  Occupancy in the Eastern Region remained relatively stable.       Utility and other income ($8.5 million) increased $4.1 million or 95% primarily due to other income generated by the 1994 Acquisitions and the one-time collection of water/sewer impact fees at one Property in 1995.                                          18         19      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)       COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 (CONTINUED)       Interest income ($2.3 million) decreased $1.3 million or 36% primarily due to a decrease in interest earned on short-term investments, partially offset by interest earned on the $15.0 million of notes receivable funded by the Company during 1994 and 1995.  Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 of approximately $4.7 million and $67.3 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an effective rate of 5.2% and 3.7% per annum, respectively.       Property operating and maintenance expenses ($27.1 million) increased $7.9 million or 41%.  The 1994 Acquisitions comprised $8.2 million of this increase. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of approximately $354,000 relating to the properties which were sold in 1994 and 1995 and a slight decrease at the Core Portfolio.  Property operating and maintenance expenses represented 27.9% of total revenues in both 1995 and 1994.       Real estate taxes ($7.2 million) increased $3.0 million or 72% due to the 1994 Acquisitions which had higher assessed values and higher tax rates than those Properties in the Core Portfolio causing real estate taxes as a percentage of revenues to increase.  In addition, tax rates increased in 1995 at the Florida and California Properties.  Real estate taxes represented 7.5% of total revenues in 1995 and 6.1% in 1994.       Property management expenses ($4.7 million) increased $576,000 or 14% due to an increase in management payroll as a result of additions in personnel directly associated with the 1994 Acquisitions and severance payments for staff terminated in 1995. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in acquisition related expenses.  In the third and fourth quarter of 1994 the Company expensed legal due diligence and related costs which had been deferred earlier in 1994 pending the outcome of acquisition reviews, thus increasing professional fees for that period.  Property management expenses represented 4.8% of total revenues in 1995 and 6.0% in 1994.       G&A expenses ($4.5 million) increased $869,000 or 24% primarily due to increased corporate payroll and related G&A expenses.  During 1994, the Company supplemented its infrastructure in preparation of the absorption of the 1994 Acquisitions and potential additional acquisition opportunities, increasing its staffing and overall corporate overhead.  In addition, professional fees increased resulting from the write-off in 1995 of legal due diligence and related costs associated with acquisitions which did not materialize.  G&A represented 4.7% of total revenues in 1995 and 5.3% in 1994.       Interest expense and related amortization ($18.5 million) increased by $7.4 million or 66%.  Interest expense increased $7.1 million due to higher weighted average outstanding debt balances during the 1995 period, as well as an increase in the effective interest rate.  The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 were $221.0 million and $154.8 million, respectively.  The effective interest rates were 7.6% and 6.27%, respectively.  Amortization increased $273,000 primarily due to the write-off of loan costs related to the $50 million line of credit with GECC which expired in March 1995.  Interest expense and related amortization represented 19.1% of total revenues in 1995 and 16.2% in 1994.       Depreciation expense and other costs ($16.1 million) increased $6.6 million or 67% as a result of the 1994 Acquisitions. In addition, the Company sold a portion of the interest rate cap on the Mortgage Debt related to 1996 and incurred a non-cash charge of $650,000 in 1995.  Depreciation expense and other costs represented 16.6% of total revenues in 1995 and 13.8% in 1994.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Net cash provided by operating activities increased $9.5 million from $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1995 to $49.7 million for the same period in 1996.  This increase reflected a $7.7 million increase in FFO, which reflected increases in rental income and decreases of certain expenses as discussed in "Results of Operations" above, an increase in accounts payable accruals of approximately $1.6 million primarily related to acquisition activities and real estate taxes, and an increase in collection of rents receivable of $498,000, partially offset by decreased collections of miscellaneous receivables.                                            19         20      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)       Net cash provided by operating activities increased $15.3 million from $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1994 to $40.2 million for the same period in 1995.  This increase reflected an $8.3 million increase in FFO, as discussed below, and the impact of the following:  (i) increased collection of rents receivable of approximately $922,000; (ii) increased collection of miscellaneous receivables of $840,000; (iii) increased accounts payable accruals of approximately $2.0 million primarily related to an increase in real estate taxes and payroll; and (iv) decreased cash in 1994 of $2.4 million as a result of acquiring the prepaid rents and security deposits of the 1994 Acquisitions.       FFO was defined by the NAREIT in March 1995 as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ["GAAP"]), before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of propery, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for significant non-recurring items, if any.  In the first quarter of 1996, the Company adopted this new definition of FFO which was effective for periods ending after December 31, 1995.  Prior to this adoption, FFO was defined as income before allocation to minority interests plus certain non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization.  The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.  Funds available for distribution ("FAD") is defined as FFO less non-revenue producing capital expenditures.  The Company believes that FFO and FAD are useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, they provide investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures.  FFO and FAD in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.       The following table presents a calculation of FFO and FAD for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 (amounts in the thousands):                                                         For the Years Ended                                                         December 31,                                                   ------------------------- Computation of funds from operations:              1996     1995     1994                                                   -------  -------  -------         Income before allocation to   minority interests............................  $26,943  $20,023  $16,616    Depreciation on real estate assets...........   14,762   14,738    9,277    Gain on sale of assets and other     non-recurring items.........................      482     (243)     293                                                   -------  -------  -------  Funds from operations (a)......................  $42,187  $34,518  $26,186                                                   =======  =======  ======= Computation of funds available for distribution:  Funds from operations (a)......................  $42,187  $34,518  $26,186    Non-revenue producing improvements -     rental properties...........................

Net cash used in investing activities increased $65.4 million from $4.4 million provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1995 to $61.0 million used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996, primarily due to the acquisitions of Waterford and the Casa del Sol Resorts, the financing of Candlelight Village, the costs incurred in pursuit of a proposed merger, a decrease in cash from the sale of rental properties in 1996 when compared to 1995 and the purchase of short-term investments, all of which had maturities of three months or less.  Partially offsetting this increase were increased distributions from Realty Systems, Inc. ("RSI").                                          20         21     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)       Net cash used in investing activities decreased $225.1 million from $220.7 million used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1994 to $4.4 million provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1995 due to the following:  (i) a decrease in contributions to RSI; (ii) a decrease in funding of notes receivable; (iii) the payoff of a $1.5 million note receivable; (iv) an increase in cash from sale of rental properties in 1995 when compared to 1994; and (v) a decrease in cash used for acquisition activities as no acquisitions took place in 1995. Partially offsetting the decrease was a decrease in the redemption of short-term investments, all of which had maturities of three months or less.       During 1996, the Company began a proxy solicitation in opposition to Chateau Properties, Inc.'s ) "Chateau" proposed merger with ROC Communities, Inc. ("ROC") and incurred approximately $1.3 million in costs and invested in certain saleable assets with a book value of approximately $9.9 million.  These expenditures have been included in prepaid expenses and other assets at December 31, 1996.  On February 11, 1997, the Chateau shareholders approved Chateau's purchase of ROC.  Thus, the Company will sell the assets acquired and write-off the capitalized costs in the first quarter of 1997.       During 1995 and 1996, the Company focused on reducing its investment in RSI.  RSI has reduced its inventory which has allowed for increased distributions to the Company.  In addition, in July 1996, RSI entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated lender whereby the lender will provide floor plan financing on the purchase of new inventory.  This agreement allowed RSI to distribute approximately $5.0 million back to the Company.       On February 28, 1996, the Company acquired Waterford, located near Wilmington, Delaware, for a purchase price of approximately $21 million.  The acquisition was funded with an $18.6 million borrowing under the Company's line of credit and approximately $2.4 million of existing available cash.  Waterford consists of 621 developed sites and 110 expansion sites; the cost of developing the expansion sites will be paid by the seller.       On May 9, 1996, the Company funded a recourse real estate loan for $6,050,000 to the partnership which owns Candlelight Village, located in Columbus, Indiana.  The loan has an interest rate of 9.5%, 9.75% and 10% for the first, second and third years of the loan, respectively, which interest is payable monthly.  Interest and principal are guaranteed by the general partner of the partnership which owns Candlelight Village.  The loan matures May 8, 1999 at which time the Company has the option to purchase Candlelight Village. Candlelight Village consists of 512 sites and 73 expansion sites.  For financial accounting purposes, the Company accounts for the loan as an investment in real estate.       On October 23, 1996, the Company acquired the Casa del Sol Resorts, located near Phoenix, Arizona, for a purchase price of approximately $17 million.  The acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit with a bank.  The Casa del Sol Resorts consist of 485 sites.       Capital expenditures for improvements were approximately $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 compared to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1995.  Of the $8.1 million, approximately $3.4 million represented improvements to existing sites.  The Company anticipates spending approximately $3.2 million on improvements to existing sites during 1997. The Company believes these improvements are necessary in order to increase and/or maintain occupancy levels and maximize rental rates charged to new and renewing residents.  The remaining $4.7 million primarily represented costs to develop approximately 370 expansion sites at certain of the Properties and costs associated with the Company's conversion to a new accounting software system and other corporate headquarter expenditures.  The Company is currently developing  an additional 104 sites which should be available for occupancy in 1997.       Net cash provided by financing activities increased $56.6 million from $45.7 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1995 to $10.9 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily due to $52.1 million of borrowings under the line of credit for the acquisitions of Waterford and the Casa del Sol Resorts and the financing of Candlelight Village.       Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $216.1 million from $170.4 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1994 to $45.7 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1995 primarily due to an increase in cash in 1994 resulting from the sale of common stock in September 1994 and proceeds received from mortgage notes payable and the line of credit, which cash was used to fund the 1994 Acquisitions.                                         21         22     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)       Distributions to common stockholders and minority interests increased $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 when compared to the same period in 1995 due to an increase in the distribution per share and number of shares and OP units outstanding.  For the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company declared and paid quarterly distributions totaling $1.22 per share, which included the fourth quarter distribution paid on January 10, 1997. Distributions to common stockholders and minority interests increased by $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1995 compared to the same period in 1994 due to an increase in the distribution per share and number of shares and OP units outstanding.  For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company declared and paid quarterly distributions totaling $1.18 per share, which included the fourth quarter distribution paid on January 12, 1996.  Return of capital on a GAAP basis was $0.24 and $0.44 for the years ended December 31,1996 and 1995, respectively.       On January 2, 1996, certain members of management of the Company each entered into subscription agreements with the Company to acquire a total of 270,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $17.375 per share, the market price on that date. The Company received from these individuals notes (the "1996 Employee Notes") in exchange for their shares.  The 1996 Employee Notes accrue interest at 5.91%, mature on January 2, 2005, and are recourse against the employees in the event the pledged shares are insufficient to repay the obligations.       Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease matures.  Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.       The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing line of credit.  The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to working capital.
