ITEM 7.       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND               RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.           The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in conjunction with the description of our business included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position.           This discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainty. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under "Forward-Looking Statements."                                         21   GENERAL           We are one of the leading providers of flexible healthcare staffing services, including nursing and ancillary services, to the U.K. healthcare industry. We operate a community-based network of over 115 branches, with the capacity to provide nurses, carers (known as home health aides in the U.S.) and specialized medical personnel to locations covering approximately 90% of the population of Great Britain. We provide healthcare staffing services to hospitals, local governmental authorities, nursing homes and private patients in the U.K. We also supply medical-grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to the U.K. pharmacy market and to private patients in Northern Ireland.           On April 16, 2003, we disposed of the last of our U.S. operations when we sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of The PromptCare Companies, Inc. and Steri-Pharm, Inc. for approximately $8,500,000 in cash. These two subsidiaries constituted our U.S. home healthcare operations segment. Our home healthcare operations were concentrated in New York and New Jersey and supplied infusion therapy, respiratory therapy and home medical equipment. The sale of this non-core segment allows us to focus our business on providing staffing services to the healthcare industry. In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," we have accounted for our home healthcare operations as a discontinued operation. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our home healthcare operations for the current and prior periods are reported in discontinued operations on our income statement.           On July 25, 2002, we consummated the Reorganization. Pursuant to the Reorganization, equity investments in TWUK and subordinated debt investments in Allied Healthcare (UK) were exchanged for shares of our common stock and shares of our new Series A preferred stock. The net effect of the Reorganization was that TWUK became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of our company and the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") issued by Allied Healthcare (UK) were exchanged for shares of our Series A preferred stock. The primary purpose of the Reorganization was our desire to increase shareholder value by having us and our subsidiaries be viewed as "one company" by the marketplace. Other objectives of the Reorganization were to streamline our corporate structure, improve the potential for equity financings in order to take advantage of attractive opportunities in the U.S. healthcare staffing services market and effectively convert the equity and subordinated debt investments in our U.K. subsidiaries into direct investments in us. We believe that the Reorganization resulted in our company having a more straight-forward and integrated management and corporate structure.           In the Reorganization, accrued and unpaid interest owed to the holders of the Notes issued by Allied Healthcare (UK) was satisfied by the exchange for shares of our common stock at the rate of 0.3488 shares for every (pound)2.00 of accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes. We issued 116,759 shares of common stock in settlement of accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes in fiscal 2002 and an additional 890,098 shares of common stock in settlement of accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes were issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.                                         22            In the Reorganization, we issued an aggregate of 2,358,930 shares of our common stock and 7,773,660 shares of our Series A preferred stock. The Series A preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of $35,213,000. On our balance sheet, the shares of common stock have been valued at $3.91 per share, the closing price on AMEX of our common stock at April 24, 2002, the date of the execution of the agreement relating to the Reorganization, and the shares of Series A preferred stock issued in connection with the Reorganization have been valued at $35,213,000, excluding issuance costs. At issuance, as the value of a share of common stock into which a share of Series A preferred stock was convertible was less than the conversion price, there was no economic incentive for a holder of Series A preferred stock to convert and, accordingly, there was no beneficial conversion feature in the Series A preferred stock under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.           Our revenue mix and payor mix is influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles. The following table shows the percentage of historical net revenues represented by each of our product lines:                                                            Year Ended            Year Ended             Year Ended                                                       September 30,          September 30,          September 30,                                                            2003                  2002                   2001                                                           ------                ------                 ------        Product Line: Net patient services..........................            97.8%                  98.0%                  94.7% Net respiratory, medical equipment and    supplies ..................................             2.2                    2.0                    5.3                                                           ------                ------                 ------               Total revenues..................            100.0%                100.0%                 100.0%                                                           ======                ======                 ======            The following table shows the historical payor mix for our total revenues for the periods presented:                                                            Year Ended            Year Ended             Year Ended                                                       September 30,          September 30,          September 30,                                                            2003                  2002                   2001                                                            ----                  ----                   ----        Payor: U.K. NHS and other   U.K. governmental payors....................             64.8%                 67.8%                  61.3% Private payors................................             35.2                  32.2                   38.7                                                           ------                ------                 ------               Total revenues..................            100.0%                100.0%                 100.0%                                                           ------                ------                 ------            The decrease in NHS and other U.K. governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in billable rates per hour achieved in the NHS due to the introduction of the Framework Agreements, together with a migration of nursing placements into private nursing homes where                                         23   higher margins were achieved. The increase in NHS and other U.K. governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to our U.K. acquisitions, which derive the majority of their revenues from the NHS, and to organic growth in the core flexible staffing business. We believe that our payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and to a lesser extent, from shifts in existing business among payors.           Our gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of our product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin.           At September 30, 2003, we had $185,722,000 of intangible assets (primarily goodwill) on our balance sheet compared to $123,514,000 at September 30, 2002. This represented 59.6% of total assets and 247.1% of total stockholders' equity at September 30, 2003 and 46.1% of total assets and 229.0% of total stockholders' equity at September 30, 2002. In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 142, which we adopted effective October 1, 2001, all existing and newly acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization. Amortization of other intangibles still subject to amortization was $207,000 for the year ended September 30, 2003. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to increase the amount of intangible assets on the balance sheet.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Accounts Receivable           We are required to estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivables, which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current credit-worthiness of each customer. Significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future as we continue to expand our business and as conditions in the marketplace change.  Intangible Assets           We have significant amounts of goodwill. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in strategy and/or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and may require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill. In addition, goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter. However, a more frequent evaluation would be performed if indicators of impairment were present.  Deferred Income Taxes           We account for deferred income taxes based upon differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The determination of whether or not valuation allowances are required to be recorded involves                                         24   significant estimates regarding the future profitability of our company, as well as potential tax strategies for the utilization of net loss and operating loss carry forwards.  Contingencies           Related to our acquisitions of certain flexible staffing agencies, we have entered into agreements to pay additional amounts, in cash, as contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of such acquired entities. See Notes 4 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2003.           Also, we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.  Revenue Recognition           Patient services and respiratory therapy revenues are recognized when services are performed and substantiated by proper documentation. For patient services, which are billed at fixed rates and account for over 95% of our company's business, revenue is recognized upon completion of timesheets that also require the signature of the recipient of services. Revenues from the rental of home medical equipment (including respiratory equipment) are recognized over the rental period (typically on a month-to-month basis). Revenues from the sale of oxygen and supplies for use in respiratory therapy are recognized when products are shipped, a contractual arrangement exists, the sales price is either fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.           We receive a majority of our revenue from the NHS and other U.K. governmental payors. Certain revenues are subject to review by third-party payors and adjustments, if any, are recorded when determined.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended September 30, 2003 vs. Year Ended September 30, 2002  Revenues - --------           Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2003 were $294,379,000 compared to $242,828,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, an increase of $51,551,000 or 21.2%. This increase relates primarily to the growth of our company's U.K. flexible staffing operations as a result of internal growth ($11,053,000) and acquisitions ($15,577,000) as well as internal growth in our U.K. respiratory, medical equipment and supplies operations ($955,000). An increase of $23,966,000 was due to the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange.                                         25   Gross Profit - ------------  Total gross profit increased by $15,244,000 to $81,323,000 for the year ended September 30, 2003 from $66,079,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, an increase of 23.1%. The favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange accounted for $6,621,000 of the increase. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2003 increased to 27.6% from 27.2% for the comparable prior period. Gross margins for patient services increased (27.3% for the year ended September 30, 2003 versus 26.9% for the comparable prior period). Gross margins in the respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales increased (43.4% for the year ended September 30, 2003 versus 41.7% for the comparable prior period) mainly due to an increased focus on sales of portable oxygen therapy equipment and a steady increase in the number of patients in Northern Ireland, while keeping costs static.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses - --------------------------------------------           Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4,801,000 to $53,648,000 for the year ended September 30, 2003 from $48,847,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, an increase of 9.8%. The increase was mainly a result of higher level of overhead costs in our U.K. operations due principally to acquisitions and internal growth ($8,310,000), higher level of overhead costs in the U.S. corporate office as well as charges associated with the exercise of employee stock options ($1,297,000), and changes in foreign exchange ($4,056,000). This increase was partially offset by the effects of recording, for the year ended September 30, 2002, a non-cash charge of $5,835,000 representing $4,216,000 for the issuance of shares of our common stock to senior management and $1,619,000 related to the exchange of employees' redeemable shares (options) in TWUK for shares of our common stock, using the net exercise method in the Reorganization, a $2,341,000 charge representing certain tax equalization bonuses paid to senior management for the reimbursement of income taxes incurred as a result of share issuances and a net charge of $686,000 principally reflecting the write-off of non-capitalized costs incurred in connection with evaluating options to maximize the value of our ownership interest in our U.K. operations.  Interest Income - ---------------           Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2003 was $2,032,000 compared to $3,024,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, which represents a decrease of $992,000. The decrease was attributable to a lower level of funds invested as well as decreases in interest rates and was partially offset by favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange ($159,000).  Interest Expense - ----------------           Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2003 was $13,311,000 compared to $16,496,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002, which represents a decrease of $3,185,000. Excluding the $1,070,000 increase due to the effect of foreign exchange, the actual decrease in interest expense was $4,255,000. The decrease was principally attributable to the exchange of accrued and unpaid interest on the senior subordinated promissory notes of Allied Healthcare (UK) for shares of our company's common stock as part of the Reorganization                                         26   ($2,627,000). The decrease was also attributable to reduced bank debt as well as a reduction in interest rates. The decrease was partially offset by the recording of a $203,000 charge related to a change in the fair value of our company's interest rate cap and floor collar agreement.  Gain on Settlement of Paid in Kind Interest - -------------------------------------------           We recognized a gain of $5,143,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 on the settlement of accrued and unpaid interest owed to the holders of the Notes of Allied Healthcare (UK) in exchange for new shares of our common stock.  Provision for Income Taxes - --------------------------           We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $4,910,000 or 30.0% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2003 versus a provision of $4,971,000 or 56.0% of income before income taxes, minority interest and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2002. Included in the tax provision for the year ended September 30, 2003 is a benefit related to the reversal of an estimated income tax liability ($1,873,000) for a business that was previously discontinued and no longer has any tax liabilities. Excluding this benefit, the provision for income taxes would have been $6,783,000 or 41.4% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2003. The difference between the 41.4% effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2003 and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to our recording of an additional valuation allowance for the tax benefit associated with the current year's U.S. operating loss.  Minority Interest - -----------------           We reported a charge for minority interest of $120,000 in the year ended September 30, 2002. The minority interest represented the 1,050,000 shares of class A1 common stock of TWUK issued as part of the Nightingale consideration. In the Reorganization, we acquired these shares and the U.K. operations became wholly owned by our company.  Discontinued Operations and Gain on sale of Subsidiaries - --------------------------------------------------------           Discontinued operations resulted in income of $503,000 for the year ended September 30, 2003 compared to income of $1,001,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002. On April 16, 2003, we sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two of our subsidiaries for approximately $8,500,000 in cash. Home Healthcare, which comprised our U.S. operations, was concentrated in New York and New Jersey, and supplied infusion therapy, respiratory therapy and home medical equipment. In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," our company has accounted for Home Healthcare as a discontinued operation. The following table presents the financial results of the discontinued operations:                                         27                                                                                     YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,                                                                          2003                          2002                                                                     --------------------------------------------            Revenues:       Net infusion services                                      $       6,685,000               $   12,373,000        Net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies                    2,479,000                    4,697,000                                                                     ---------------                 ------------           Total revenues                                                  9,164,000                   17,070,000                                                                     ---------------                 ------------       Cost of revenues:        Infusion services                                                  5,159,000                    9,068,000        Respiratory, medical equipment and supplies                        1,438,000                    2,292,000                                                                     ---------------                 ------------           Total cost of revenues                                          6,597,000                   11,360,000                                                                     ---------------                 ------------         Selling, general and administrative expenses                       2,583,000                    4,709,000       Gain on sale of subsidiaries, net of tax                             519,000                           --                                                                     ---------------                 ------------        Income from discontinued operations                        $         503,000               $    1,001,000                                                                     ===============                 ============       Diluted income per share from discontinued       operations                                                 $            0.02               $         0.05                                                                     ===============                 ============   Net Income - ----------           As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of $11,971,000 for the year ended September 30, 2003 compared to net income of $4,794,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002.  Series A Preferred Stock - ------------------------           For the year ended September 30, 2003, we accrued $3,523,000 of dividends for the Series A preferred stock issued in connection with the Reorganization and accreted $ 482,000 of costs related to the issuance of our Series A preferred stock. For the year ended September 30, 2002, we accrued $941,000 of dividends for the Series A preferred stock issued in connection with the Reorganization and accreted $75,000 of costs related to the issuance of our Series A preferred stock.  Year Ended September 30, 2002 vs. Year Ended September 30, 2001  Revenues - --------           Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2002 were $242,828,000 compared to $138,041,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001, an increase of $104,787,000 or 75.9% (72.4% excluding the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange). This increase relates primarily to the growth of our company's U.K. flexible staffing operations as a result of acquisitions, principally Staffing Enterprise Limited and Staffing (PSV) Limited (collectively "Staffing Enterprise") ($62,902,000), Crystalglen Limited (operating under the trade name "Nurses Direct") ($13,136,000), and Balfor Medical ($5,642,000) with the remaining increase ($23,107,000) principally reflecting organic growth in the staffing operations.  Gross Profit - ------------           Total gross profit increased by $23,588,000 to $66,079,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 from $42,491,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001, an increase of 55.5% (52.4% excluding the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange). As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2002 decreased to 27.2% from 30.8% for the comparable prior period. Gross margins for patient services decreased (26.9% for the year                                         28   ended September 30, 2002 versus 30.7% for the comparable prior period) principally due to an increase in the percentage of revenues derived from the staffing of nurses and other more highly paid professionals, which have lower margins than the historical carer business. In addition, U.K. regulatory changes, which extend the entitlement of holiday pay to temporary workers, served to reduce gross margins in the year ended September 30, 2002. Gross margins in the respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales increased (41.7% for the year ended September 30, 2002 versus 32.6% for the comparable prior period) mainly due to the sales mix.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses - --------------------------------------------           Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $12,450,000 to $48,847,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 from $36,397,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001, an increase of 34.2% (32.1% excluding the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange). The increase reflects (i) $2,341,000 representing certain tax equalization bonuses paid to senior management for the reimbursement of income taxes incurred as a result of share issuances, (ii) a non-cash charge of $5,835,000, representing $4,216,000 for the issuance of shares of our common stock to senior management and $1,619,000 related to the exchange of employees' redeemable shares (options) in TWUK for shares of our common stock, using the net exercise method in the Reorganization, (iii) a net charge of $686,000, principally reflecting the write-off of non-capitalized costs incurred in connection with evaluating options to maximize the value of our ownership interest in our U.K. operations, and (iv) the higher level of overhead costs in our U.K. operations due principally to acquisitions and internal growth. This increase was partially offset by the application of FAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," whereby goodwill is no longer being amortized ($3,725,000), effective October 1, 2001. In addition, we incurred $3,883,000 of expenses in fiscal 2001 related to exiting our U.S. mail-order operations.  Losses due to Sale of Subsidiary - --------------------------------           For the year ended September 30, 2001, we recorded losses of $354,000 due to the sale of Amcare Limited, a U.K. subsidiary, as a result of the completion of the transaction.  Interest Income - ---------------           Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2002 was $3,024,000 compared to $1,587,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001. The increase was attributable to a higher level of funds invested.  Interest Expense - ----------------           Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2002 was $16,496,000 compared to $10,020,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of average borrowings outstanding, as well as the write-off of $925,000 of deferred financing fees, per FAS No. 145, related to certain costs associated with our 1999 financing of our U.K. operations.                                         29   Gain on Settlement of Paid in Kind Interest - -------------------------------------------           We recognized a gain of $5,143,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 on the settlement of accrued and unpaid interest owed to the holders of the Notes of Allied Healthcare (UK) in exchange for new shares of our common stock.  Provision for Income Taxes - --------------------------           We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $4,971,000 or 56.0% of income before income taxes and minority interest for the year ended September 30, 2002 versus a provision of $24,117,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001. The difference between the 55.6% effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2002 and the statutory tax rate is due to our recording of an additional valuation allowance for the tax benefit associated with the fiscal 2002 U.S. operating loss.           We had been previously committed to implementing tax strategies that provided for the sale of appreciated assets, including a portion of our ownership interest in our U.K. subsidiary, to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the tax net operating losses prior to their expiration. While we believe we will eventually realize the value of our tax losses, current developments, including the continued expansion of our U.K. operations has increased the uncertainty as to both the execution of the original strategy and the appropriateness of a tax strategy which may not align with our current business strategy. These uncertainties have impaired our ability to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, a full valuation allowance for all remaining deferred tax assets was provided.  Minority Interest - -----------------           We reported a charge for minority interest of $120,000 in the year ended September 30, 2002 compared to a charge of $22,000 in the year ended September 30, 2001. The minority interest represented the 1,050,000 shares of class A1 common stock of TWUK issued as part of the Nightingale consideration. In the Reorganization we acquired these shares and the U.K. operations became wholly owned by our company.  Discontinued Operations - -----------------------           Discontinued operations resulted in income of $1,001,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 compared to income of $620,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001. The following table presents the financial results of the discontinued operations:                                                                                    YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,                                                                          2002                          2001                                                                     --------------------------------------------            Revenues:       Net infusion services                                      $      12,373,000               $   12,505,000        Net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies                    4,697,000                    4,087,000                                                                     ---------------                 ------------           Total revenues                                                 17,070,000                   16,592,000                                                                     ---------------                 ------------                                          30                                                                                     YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,                                                                          2002                          2001                                                                     --------------------------------------------             Cost of revenues:        Infusion services                                               9,068,000                    8,959,000        Respiratory, medical equipment and supplies                     2,292,000                    2,146,000                                                                     -----------                  -----------           Total cost of revenues                                      11,360,000                   11,105,000                                                                     -----------                  -----------         Selling, general and administrative expenses                    4,709,000                    4,867,000                                                                     -----------                  -----------        Income from discontinued operations                           $ 1,001,000                  $   620,000                                                                     ===========                  ===========       Diluted income per share from discontinued       operations                                                    $     0.05                   $      0.04                                                                     ==========                   ===========   Net Income - ----------           As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of $4,794,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 compared to a loss of $26,612,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001.  Series A Preferred Stock - ------------------------           We accrued $941,000 of dividends in the year ended September 30, 2002 for the Series A preferred stock issued in connection with the Reorganization and accreted $75,000 of costs related to the issuance of our Series A preferred stock.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  General           For our fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, we generated $15,110,000 from operating activities. Cash requirements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 for capital expenditures ($4,026,000), payments on acquisitions payable ($7,031,000), payments for acquisitions ($9,531,000), payment on notes payable ($19,363,000) and payments on long-term debt ($6,727,000) were met through operating cash flows, proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations ($8,195,000), restricted cash and cash on hand.           In January 2001, we initiated a stock repurchase program, whereby we may purchase up to approximately $1,000,000 of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. In May 2003, we initiated a second stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may purchase up to an additional $3,000,000 of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. As of September 30, 2003, we had acquired 407,700 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,285,000 pursuant to our stock repurchase programs, which are reflected as treasury stock in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2003. We intend to continue with our stock repurchases during fiscal 2004.           We believe our existing capital resources and those generated from operating activities and available under existing borrowing arrangements will be adequate to conduct our operations for the next twelve months.                                         31   Restricted Cash           Restricted cash represents proceeds limited to future acquisitions. The proceeds refer to amounts available for payment of consideration for certain permitted acquisitions under our senior collateralized term and revolving credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility"), including the payment of additional contingent consideration, which have been advanced under the Senior Credit Facility.           The current portion of restricted cash represents the amount on deposit, as required by the senior credit lender, for the sole purpose of repaying the notes payable issued in connection with the acquisition of certain U.K. flexible staffing agencies.  Accounts Receivable           We maintain a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, $35,745,000 (11.5%) and $32,113,000 (12.0%), respectively, of our total assets consisted of accounts receivable. The increase in the accounts receivable from 2002 to 2003 is mainly due to the acquisition of Medic-One, a supplier of temporary staffing to NHS hospitals and private hospitals in the U.K., which was slightly offset by the timing of cash collections.           Our goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry average, which would tend to mitigate the risk of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. Days sales outstanding ("DSOs") is a measure of the average number of days we take to collect our accounts receivable, calculated from the date services are rendered. At September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, our average DSOs were 41 and 42, respectively. The decrease in the DSOs was mainly due to the timing of cash collections.  Borrowings  General - -------           On December 17, 1999, as amended on September 21, 2001, our company's U.K. subsidiaries, TWUK and its subsidiary, obtained financing denominated in pounds sterling. At September 30, 2003, this financing had an aggregate availability of approximately $178,092,000, consisting of a $159,208,000 Senior Credit Facility and $18,884,000 in mezzanine indebtedness (the "Mezzanine Loan").  Senior Credit Facility - ----------------------           The Senior Credit Facility consists of the following:           o    $46,679,000 term loan A, maturing December 17, 2005;           o    $20,839,000 acquisition term loan B, maturing December 17, 2006;                                         32            o    $83,355,000 term loan C, maturing June 30, 2007; and           o    $8,335,000 revolving facility, maturing December 17, 2005.           Repayment of the loans under the Senior Credit Facility commenced on July 30, 2000 and continues until final maturity. The loans bear interest at rates equal to LIBOR plus 2.00% to 3.50% per annum. At September 30, 2003, we had outstanding borrowings of $110,195,000 under the Senior Credit Facility that bore interest at rates ranging from 5.63% to 7.13%.           Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Credit Facility prohibits or restricts the following:           o    the incurrence of liens;          o    the incurrence of additional indebtedness;          o    certain fundamental corporate changes;          o    dividends (including distributions to us);          o    the making of specified investments; and          o    certain transactions with affiliates.           In addition, the Senior Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as senior interest coverage, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, fixed charge coverage and minimum net worth. At September 30, 2003, we are in compliance with such covenants.           The loans under the Senior Credit Facility are collateralized by, among other things, a lien on substantially all of TWUK's and its subsidiaries' assets, a pledge of TWUK's ownership interest in its subsidiaries and guaranties by TWUK's subsidiaries.  Mezzanine Loan - --------------           The Mezzanine Loan is a term loan maturing December 17, 2007 and bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 7% per annum, where LIBOR plus 3.5% will be payable in cash, with the remaining interest being added to the principal amount of the loan. The Mezzanine Loan contains other terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in the Senior Credit Facility. At September 30, 2003, we had outstanding borrowings under the Mezzanine Loan of $17,490,000, which bore interest at a rate of 10.63%.  Notes with Warrants - -------------------           In connection with the Reorganization, the notes with warrants were settled by the issuance of 890,000 shares of our common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.                                         33   Notes Due in Connection with Acquisitions - -----------------------------------------           In fiscal 2003 we repaid, through TWUK, notes payable in the principal amount of $19,363,000 issued in connection with the acquisition of certain U.K. flexible staffing agencies and wrote-off $613,000 of related discount. In fiscal 2003, we also issued notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $36,026,000, to satisfy our obligations to pay additional consideration to the sellers of businesses that we had acquired; the amount of each note depended on the earnings of the acquired business after our acquisition of it. The notes payable are secured by the lender under our Senior Credit Facility. Our Senior Credit Facility requires us to keep an amount on deposit for the sole purpose of repaying the notes payable. These notes bear interest at rates ranging from 2.65% to 5.25%. In general, we may not repay the notes on or before three years after the date of issuance; however, such notes may be redeemed by the holders within one year from the first interest payment due date upon giving not less than sixty days written notice. We had outstanding notes payable in connection with acquisitions of $37,693,000 and related cash restricted to the payment of such notes classified as current in the balance sheet included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2003.  Guarantees - ----------           Our U.K. subsidiaries guarantee the debt and other obligations of certain wholly-owned U.K. subsidiaries under the Senior Credit Facility, the Mezzanine Loan and various notes issued in connection with the acquisition of certain U.K. flexible staffing agencies. At September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, the amounts guaranteed, which approximates the amounts outstanding, totaled approximately $167,000,000 and $151,000,000, respectively.  Series A Preferred Stock - ------------------------           In the Reorganization, we issued 7,773,660 shares of our Series A preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of (pound)22,286,869 ($35,213,253 at the fixed exchange rate of $1.58 set forth in an amendment to our certificate of incorporation defining the rights of the Series A preferred stock). The shares of Series A preferred stock were issued to certain equity investors in TWUK in exchange for 22,286,869 ordinary shares of TWUK. Such ordinary shares were issued to such investors upon exercise of the warrants that had been issued to them in connection with the sale to them in 1999 of Notes of Allied Healthcare (UK). The Series A preferred stock has been recorded net of issuance costs, which are being accreted using the interest rate method through December 17, 2007.           The following summary highlights the terms of the Series A preferred stock.           Dividends. Each share of Series A preferred stock is entitled to receive cumulative, compounding dividends at the per share rate of 9.375% of (pound)2.867 ($4.58 at the fixed exchange rate of $1.58 set forth in an amendment to our certificate of incorporation defining the rights of the Series A preferred stock) per year. The shares of Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends at a higher rate in the event of a covenant breach (as that term is defined in the Certificate of Amendment (relating to the Series A preferred stock) to our Certificate of Incorporation), which principally relates to the protection of the rights of the holders of our                                         34   Series A preferred stock. Any accrued but unpaid dividends will be paid upon the liquidation, redemption or conversion of the Series A preferred stock. We may not declare or pay any dividends, make any distributions, or set aside any funds or assets for payment or distribution with regard to our common stock or any other class or series of our stock ranking junior to the Series A preferred stock until all accumulated dividends on the Series A preferred stock have been paid.           Voting Rights. Each outstanding share of Series A preferred stock is entitled to that number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such share of Series A preferred stock is convertible. Except with respect to the directors to be elected by the holders of the Series A preferred stock, voting as a class, the Series A preferred stock and the common stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders. Until Triumph Partners III, L.P. (or any of its affiliates) beneficially owns less than 50% of the shares of Series A preferred stock issued to it in the Reorganization, the holders of Series A preferred stock will be entitled, voting as a separate class, to elect one director to our board of directors. In addition, the Series A preferred stock and our common stock will vote as a single class in the election of all other directors of our board of directors. In the event of a covenant breach (as that term is defined in the Certificate of Amendment (relating to the Series A preferred stock) to our Certificate of Incorporation), the holders of the Series A preferred stock will be entitled to elect one additional director to our board of directors.           Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, the holders of Series A preferred stock will be entitled to receive, before the holders of common stock or any other class or series of stock ranking junior to the Series A preferred stock will be entitled to receive anything in respect of their shares, a liquidation preference equal to $4.53 per share (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar transactions), plus any accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A preferred stock, which we refer to as the "Series A Preference Amount"; provided, however, that in the event that the holders of Series A preferred stock would have received an amount greater than the Series A Preference Amount had they converted their Series A preferred stock into shares of common stock immediately prior to the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, such holders will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the amount they would have received had they effectuated such a conversion.           Conversion into Common Stock. Each share of Series A preferred stock is currently convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into one share of common stock without the payment of additional consideration. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we have the right to require the holders of the Series A preferred stock to convert all, but not less than all, of their shares into common stock. At issuance, as the value of a share of common stock into which a share of Series A preferred stock was convertible was less than the conversion price, there was no economic incentive for a holder of Series A preferred stock to convert and, accordingly, there was no beneficial conversion feature in the Series A preferred stock under generally accepted accounting principles.           Redemption. Subject to certain limitations, a majority in interest of the holders of the Series A preferred stock have the right to require our company to redeem their shares of Series A                                         35   preferred stock upon the occurrence of a liquidity event (as described in the Certificate of Amendment (relating to the Series A preferred stock) to our Certificate of Incorporation) or at any time after December 17, 2007 if we have paid our Senior Credit Facility and the Mezzanine Loan (as defined in "Item 7--Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources--Borrowings") in full on or before such date. The redemption right can be exercised up to three times, but for not less than (pound)5 million on any one occasion (or such lower amount as is necessary to redeem all of the shares of Series A preferred stock then outstanding). Upon such a redemption, the holders of the Series A preferred stock will be entitled to receive an amount equal to the Series A Preference Amount.  Commitments  Acquisition Agreements - ----------------------           Related to our acquisitions of certain flexible staffing agencies, we have entered into agreements to pay additional amounts, payable in cash and shares of our common stock, of up to $13,579,000, at September 30, 2003, in contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of such acquired entities.  Employment Agreements - ---------------------           We have two employment agreements with certain executive officers (our chief executive officer and our chief operating officer) that provided for minimum aggregate annual compensation of $825,000 in fiscal 2003. Each employment agreement contains, among other things, customary confidentiality and termination provisions and provides that in the event of the termination of the executive following a "change of control" of our company (as defined in such agreements), or a significant change in his or her responsibilities, such person will be entitled to receive a cash payment of up to 2.9 times his or her average annual base salary during the preceding 12 months. Each employment agreement expires on September 24, 2004; however, each employment agreement shall be automatically renewed on such date, and on each anniversary of such date, for an additional period of one-year, unless the Company or the executive gives notice to the other of its intent to terminate the employment agreement within 90 days of the then applicable termination date.  Operating Leases - ----------------           We have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space and equipment. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options.  Contractual Cash Obligations           As described under "Borrowings," "Commitments--Acquisition Agreements," and "Commitments--Operating Leases" above, the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2003:                                         36                                   Total Debt         Total Lease      Total Other          Total Fiscal                       Obligations         Obligations      Obligations       Obligations - -------------------     ------------------- ------------------ ---------------- -----------------          2004                    $    46,698,000     $    1,643,000     $   5,410,000    $   53,751,000 2005                         11,670,000          1,372,000         8,169,000        21,211,000 2006                         30,841,000          1,191,000                          32,032,000 2007                         58,348,000          1,116,000                          59,464,000 2008                         17,821,000            789,000                           18,610,00 Thereafter                           --          2,438,000                           2,438,000                         ------------------- ------------------ ---------------- -----------------                         $   165,378,000     $    8,549,000     $  13,579,000    $  187,506,000                         =================== ================== ================ =================            Lease obligations reflect future minimum rental commitments required under operating leases that have non-cancelable lease terms at September 30, 2003. Other obligations reflect contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of certain flexible staffing agencies.  Miscellaneous  Acquisitions - ------------           On July 8, 2003, we completed our acquisition of Cynon Health Agency, a supplier of flexible healthcare staffing services primarily to hospitals, nursing homes and prisons in the U.K. The consideration included a payment of $1,237,000 in cash and additional contingent cash consideration of $1,751,000 dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entity.           On June 27, 2003, we completed our acquisition of Carewise Nursing Agency, which specializes in supplying qualified critical care nurses to intensive care units across NHS hospitals in the U.K. The consideration included a payment of $91,000 in cash and additional contingent cash consideration of $1,575,000 dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entity.           On April 11, 2003, we completed our acquisition of First Force Medical Recruitments Limited, a supplier of flexible healthcare staffing services primarily to military and NHS hospitals in the U.K. The consideration included a payment of $787,000 in cash and additional contingent cash consideration of $2,084,000 dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entity.           On March 17, 2003, we completed our acquisitions of Ablecare Oxfordshire and Ablecare Northamptonshire, both suppliers of flexible healthcare staffing services primarily to local authority social services departments in the U.K. The consideration included a payment of $809,000 in cash and additional contingent cash consideration dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entities. In August 2003, contingent cash consideration of $630,000 was earned and paid. No additional consideration is required in connection with this acquisition.           On January 13, 2003, we completed our acquisition of Yorkshire Careline, a supplier of nurses and carers to local authority social service departments in the U.K. The consideration                                         37   included a payment of $965,000 in cash and additional contingent cash consideration of $642,000 dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entity. Such contingent consideration was earned and paid in August 2003. No additional consideration is required in connection with this acquisition.           On November 28, 2002, we completed our acquisition of Medic-One, a supplier of temporary staffing to the NHS hospitals and private hospitals in the U.K. The consideration included $4,642,000 in cash, and the issuance of 670,000 shares of our company's common stock and up to approximately $14,270,000 of additional contingent consideration based on future earnings. At September 30, 2003, our company is only obligated to issue additional contingent consideration of up to approximately $8,169,000 dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entity as $6,101,000 of the previous contingent consideration was unearned and will not be required to be paid. The additional contingent consideration, if any, will be satisfied by a combination of cash and shares of our company's stock.           On November 18, 2002, we completed our acquisition of Dalesway Nursing Services, a supplier of temporary staffing to NHS hospitals, local government authorities and private patients in the U.K. The consideration paid was $306,000 in cash.           During fiscal 2002 we acquired, through TWUK, a total of six flexible staffing agencies for approximately $2,184,000 in cash. The transactions included provisions to pay additional amounts, payable in cash, of up to $5,606,000 in contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entities. Of the $5,606,000 in contingent consideration, $4,450,000 was earned and paid in fiscal 2003. The remaining amount of contingent consideration of $1,156,000 was unearned and will not be required to be paid.           On September 27, 2001, we acquired, through TWUK, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Staffing Enterprise, a London-based provider of flexible staffing of specialist nurses and other healthcare professionals to London NHS Trust and independent hospitals. The consideration included $7,100,000 in cash, $14,800,000 in demand notes plus an additional sum of up to approximately $30,800,000 in contingent consideration dependent upon pre-tax profits for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2002. We satisfied our obligation to pay this contingent consideration by the issuance of notes payable in the first quarter of 2003.           In addition to the acquisition of Staffing Enterprise, during fiscal 2001 we acquired, through TWUK, a total of eleven other flexible staffing agencies for approximately $9,144,000 in cash and the issuance of $5,720,000 in demand notes. The transactions include provisions to pay additional amounts, payable in cash, of up to $12,993,000 in contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entities. Of the $12,993,000 in contingent consideration, $6,588,000 was earned and paid in fiscal 2002 and 2003. The remaining amount of contingent consideration of $6,405,000 was unearned and will not be required to be paid.                                         38   Dispositions - ------------           Disposition of Home Healthcare Operations           On April 16, 2003, we disposed of the last of our U.S. operations when we sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of The PromptCare Companies, Inc. and Steri-Pharm, Inc., for approximately $8,500,000 in cash. These two subsidiaries constituted our U.S. home healthcare operations segment. Our home healthcare operations were concentrated in New York and New Jersey and supplied infusion therapy, respiratory therapy and home medical equipment. In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," we have accounted for our home healthcare operations as a discontinued operation. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our home healthcare operations for the current and prior periods are reported in discontinued operations on our income statement.           Disposition of Amcare           On November 22, 2000, we sold, through TWUK, Amcare Limited for approximately $13,826,000 in cash. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we recorded a charge for impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $2,727,000 to reflect the write-down of the carrying value of goodwill, originally acquired with the purchase of Amcare Limited to its fair value as well as a tax charge of approximately $1,654,000 to reflect the tax effect of the transaction. As a result of the completion of the transaction, we recorded additional losses of $354,000 and realized a foreign exchange loss of $391,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2000.           Disposition of U.S. mail-order operations           In September 2000, we approved a plan to exit our U.S. mail-order operations and effective October 3, 2000 sold certain assets of the U.S. mail-order operations located in Jacksonville, Florida. In addition, we recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 representing the estimated costs related to exiting and closing our U.S. mail-order operations. Based upon additional information and revised cost benefit estimates, we recorded an additional charge of $1,900,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 to reflect the write-down of the remaining accounts receivable to their estimated net realizable value. In addition to the write-down, we incurred operating expenses of $1,983,000 during the year ended September 30, 2002 in connection with closing our U.S. mail-order operations. In fiscal 2002, we recognized income of $280,000, representing the difference between estimated and actual costs to close and exit the business.  Litigation - ----------           See "Item 3--Legal Proceedings."                                         39   Contingencies - -------------           Some of our subsidiaries were Medicare Part B suppliers who submitted claims to the designated carrier who is the government's claims processing administrator. From time to time, the carrier may request an audit of Medicare Part B claims on a prepayment or postpayment basis. If the outcome of any audit results in a denial or a finding of an overpayment, then the affected subsidiary has appeal rights. Under postpayment audit procedures, the supplier generally pays the alleged overpayment and can pursue appeal rights for a refund of any paid overpayment incorrectly assessed against the supplier. Some of these subsidiaries are currently responding to these audits and pursuing appeal rights in certain circumstances.           We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable Federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. Because of the broad and sometimes vague nature of these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that an enforcement action will not be brought against us, or that we will not be found to be in violation of one or more of these laws or regulations. At present, we cannot anticipate what impact, if any, subsequent administrative or judicial interpretations of applicable Federal, state and foreign laws and regulations may have on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.           We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities. We are vigorously defending our position in all such proceedings and, at September 30, 2003, have recorded an accrual of $1,117,000 to cover our estimated exposure related to these matters. We believe that these matters should not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.  Impact of Recent Accounting Standards - -------------------------------------           In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets" ("FAS No. 144"). FAS No. 144 supersedes FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-lived Assets to be Disposed Of," and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Effective October 1, 2002, we adopted FAS No. 144. On April 16, 2003, we sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two of our subsidiaries, which constituted our home healthcare operations segment. In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 144, we have accounted for our home healthcare operations as a discontinued operation.           In April 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4 (Reporting Gains and Losses From Extinguishment of Debt), 44 (Accounting for Intangible assets of Motor Carries), and 64 (Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements), Amendment of FASB Statement No.13 (Accounting for Leases), and Technical Corrections." FAS No. 145 addresses gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt and sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. We adopted FAS No. 145, effective October 1, 2001, and we recorded a charge of $925,000 in interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2002.                                         40            In June 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS No. 146"). FAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." This statement is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 15, 2002. The adoption of FAS No. 146 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.           In November 2002, the FASB approved FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation of FASB Statement Nos. 5, 57 and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," relating to a guarantor's accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. Specifically, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize a liability for the non-contingent component of certain guarantees, representing the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of a guarantor's fiscal year end. However, the disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.           In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation--Transition Disclosure, An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123" ("FAS No. 148"). This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, FAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock-based compensation. The provisions of FAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. In accordance with FAS No. 123, we continue to apply APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations, in accounting for our stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for our stock option plans in our financial statements. For purposes of disclosure in the footnotes to our financial statements, the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The adoption of FAS No. 148 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003.           In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. We are required to adopt the provisions of FIN 46 for                                         41   variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. We do not have any variable interest entities and therefore the adoption of FIN 46 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.           In April 2003, the FASB issued FAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS No. 149"). FAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under FAS No. 133 and is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of FAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.           In May 2003, the FASB issued FAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity" ("FAS No. 150"). FAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This statement requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. FAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of FAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   ITEM 7A.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE           We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results. Our primary exposure relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in the U.K. where the principal currency is pounds sterling and to the pounds sterling debt denominated obligations. See "Interest Rate Risk" below for debt obligations principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Currently, we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposures.  INTEREST RATE RISK           Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our cash equivalents and our U.K. subsidiaries' December 17, 1999 financing, which includes the Senior Credit Facility and Mezzanine Loan. Our cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments purchased with initial maturities of 90 days or less. We are subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for our variable rate Senior Credit Facility, Mezzanine Loan and cash equivalents. In accordance with provisions of the documents governing the financing, on January 25, 2000, we hedged the interest rate (LIBOR cap of 9%) on approximately $41,935,000 of our floating rate debt in a contract, which expired on June 30, 2003.                                         42            On March 20, 2003, we entered into a new Rate Cap and Floor Collar Agreement that caps our interest rate at LIBOR of 5.50% and our interest floor at LIBOR of 4.47%, subject to special provisions, on approximately $83,355,000 of our floating rate debt in a contract, which expires March 20, 2008. In accordance with FAS No. 133, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," as amended by FAS No. 138 and related implementation guidance, we have calculated the fair value of the interest cap and floor derivative to be a liability of $211,000 at September 30, 2003. In addition, changes in the value from period to period of the interest cap and floor derivative are recorded as interest expense or income, as appropriate.           As of September 30, 2003, our Series A preferred stock (with an aggregate liquidation preference of $35,213,000) bears dividends at the per share rate of 9.375% of $4.53 per annum. In addition, we had notes payable of $37,693,000, which were issued in connection with the acquisition of several U.K. flexible staffing agencies. The notes payable are redeemable, at the holder's option, in fiscal 2004 and bear interest ranging from 2.65% to 5.25% at September 30, 2003. The table below represents the expected maturity of our variable rate debt and their weighted average interest rates at September 30, 2003.
