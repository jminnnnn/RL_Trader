ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.       GENERAL       The Company changed its fiscal year to end on September 30 from October 31 effective for fiscal 1997. This resulted in an eleven month reporting period for the period ended September 30, 1997.       The Company is a provider of a broad range of health care services and products with operations in the U.K. and the U.S. The Company provides the following services and products: (i) patient services, including nursing and para-professional services; (ii) specialty mail-order pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, respiratory therapy and home medical equipment; and (iii) infusion therapy. The Company provides these services and products from the following reportable business segments: (i) U.K. Operations; (ii) U.S. Mail-Order Operations; and (iii) U.S. Hi-Tech Operations. The Company's U.K. Operations include the U.K.'s second largest commercial provider of nursing and para-professional care to the community and U.K. healthcare institutions, the U.K.'s second largest home respiratory supplier as well as a leading value-added medical supplies distributor, all with operations located throughout the U.K. The Company's Mail-Order Operations provide specialty mail-order pharmaceutical and medical supplies (including respiratory and diabetic medications and supplies, as well as ostomy and orthotic products) to patients in their home nationwide and in Puerto Rico while its U.S. Hi-Tech Operations provide infusion and respiratory therapy services and home medical equipment and are concentrated in New Jersey and New York.       The Company took a number of significant steps during the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998 and the Eleven Month Period to realign its business as a focused regional home health care provider and specialty pharmacy and medical supply distributor in the U.S. and as an integrated national provider of home and alternate site health care products and services in the U.K. These steps included (i) selling non-core assets such as the Company's Radamerica business which provided radiation therapy in the Baltimore, Maryland area and the Company's TNI operations, which provided nursing and para-professional services in New Jersey and Florida; (ii) exiting businesses that were deemed not to have the potential to earn an adequate return on capital over the long term (such as wound care and orthotic product lines in the continental U.S., as well as the Company's pulmonary rehabilitation center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey); (iii) completing the HMI Asset Sale; and (iv) terminating the agreements to purchase the VIP Companies. The Company also completed the acquisitions of Omnicare and Allied in July 1997 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $91,000,000. Omnicare provides respiratory equipment and services and supplies a range of medical and surgical products to patients at home throughout the U.K. through its network of seven regional facilities. Allied is a national provider of nursing and other care-giving services to the community and U.K. healthcare institutions with seventy-five locations throughout the U.K.       The Company's revenue mix and payor mix will be influenced to a significant degree by the relative                                         -21-     contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles. The following table shows the percentage of historical net revenues represented by each of the Company's product lines:                                                                               Eleven Months                                           Year Ended      Year Ended           Ended                                           September 30,  September 30,      September 30,                                              1999            1998               1997                                             ------          -----             ----- Product Line - ------------        Net patient services...................       51.8%          44.4%             31.9% Net respiratory, medical  equipment and supplies sales .........       42.2           49.0              56.3 Net infusion services..................        6.0            6.6              11.8                                             ------          -----             -----                   Total revenues.......      100.0%         100.0%            100.0%                                             ======          =====             =====        The increase in net patient services as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 1999 as compared to 1998 is primarily due to growth in Allied's branch network (both organically and through the on-going nursing and care agency acquisition program). The decrease in net respiratory medical equipment and supplies sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended September 30, 1999 as compared to 1998 is due primarily to a decrease in revenues in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order and Hi-Tech Operations due principally to a reduction in the number of patients serviced. Acquisitions, when completed, will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Company owned 100% of Omnicare and Allied on November 1, 1996, the percentage of total revenues for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 would have been as follows: net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales 47.3%; net patient services 44.9%; and net infusion services 7.8%.       The following table shows the historical payor mix for the Company's total revenues for the periods presented:                                                                              Eleven Months                                           Year Ended      Year Ended         Ended                                           September 30,  September 30,    September 30,                                              1999            1998             1997                                             ------          -----            ----- Payor - -----        U.K. NHS and other U.K.  governmental payors.............             36.5%         29.7%             12.9% Medicare.........................             20.9          27.2              42.0 Medicaid.........................              2.2           5.8              11.2 Private payors...................             40.4          37.3              33.9                                             ------         -----             -----          Total revenues..........            100.0%        100.0%            100.0%                                             ======         =====             =====        The increase in U.K. NHS and other U.K. governmental payors and private payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 1999 as compared to 1998 is primarily due to the growth in Allied's branch network, as described above. The decrease in Medicare and Medicaid as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 1999 as compared to 1998 is primarily due to the decrease in revenues in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order and Hi-Tech Operations, as described above. The decrease in Medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 1998 as compared to the Eleven Month Period is primarily a result of the Omnicare and Allied acquisitions. The Company believes that its payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, from shifts in existing business among payors. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Company owned 100% of                                         -22-   Omnicare and Allied on November 1, 1996, the payor mix for the Eleven Month Period would have been as follows: U.K. NHS and other U.K. governmental payors 30.4%; Medicare 27.8%; Medicaid 7.4%; and private payors (including managed care payors) 34.4%.       The Company believes that a substantial portion of its revenues derived from private payors in the U.S. was subject to case management and managed care and that this relationship will continue in the future. The Company maintains a diversified offering of home services and products in an attempt to mitigate the impact of potential reimbursement reductions for any individual product or service.       The Company's gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of its product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates. The Company historically has recognized higher gross margins from its specialized mail-order and medical supplies pharmacy and respiratory therapy operations than from its nursing and infusion therapy operations. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Company owned 100% of Omnicare and Allied on November 1, 1996, the gross profit margin for the Eleven Month Period would have been 38.8% versus the actual 45.1% for the same period. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin.       At September 30, 1999 and 1998, the Company had $103,248,000 and $105,784,000, respectively of intangible assets (primarily goodwill) on its balance sheet. This represented 60.0% of total assets and 113.1% of total stockholders' equity at September 30, 1999 and 58.9% of total assets and 103.8% of total stockholders' equity at September 30, 1998. Amortization of intangibles for the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 and the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 was $3,459,000, $3,147,000 and $1,866,000, respectively. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to increase the amount of intangible assets on the balance sheet and amortization of intangibles on the statement of operations.       The Company amortizes goodwill over a period of 40 years. The Company has selected the forty-year amortization convention based on the likely period of time over which related economic benefits will be realized. The Company believes its estimated goodwill life is reasonable given, among other factors, the continuing movement of patient care to non-institutional settings, expanding demand due to demographic trends, the emphasis of the Company on establishing coverage in each of its local and regional markets and the consistent practice of other home health care companies. At each balance sheet date, or if a significant adverse change occurs in the Company's business, management assesses the carrying amount of enterprise goodwill. The Company measures impairment of goodwill by comparing the future undiscounted cash flows (without interest) to the carrying amount of goodwill. This evaluation is done at the reportable business segment level (primarily by subsidiary). If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the future cash flows, the excess carrying amount of goodwill is written off. The factors considered by management in estimating future cash flows include current operating results, the effects of any current or proposed changes in third-party reimbursement or other governmental regulations, trends and prospects of acquired businesses, as well as the effect of demand, competition, market and other economic factors. If permanent impairment of goodwill were to be recognized in future period it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 VS. YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998.       Revenues. Total revenues decreased by $581,000 or .4% to $154,728,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 from $155,309,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998. This decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of patients serviced by the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations ($9,514,000) and                                         -23-   Hi-Tech Operations ($1,666,000) and the incremental impact of the Balanced Budget Act, which reduced revenue in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations by $611,000. In addition, the sale of TNI accounted for a decrease of $7,661,000. These decreases were substantially offset by increases in the Company's U.K. Operations, specifically, patient services ($18,934,000). The U.K. Operations increased principally due to continued expansion, increased billing rates and an increase in the number of patients serviced.       Pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act, a 10% reduction in Medicare reimbursement of diabetic testing strips and a 5% reduction in Medicare reimbursement of respiratory drugs became effective January 1, 1998. These reductions reduced revenue, increased cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues and decreased gross profit for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction (as discussed herein).       In addition, pursuant to the Social Security Act, which gives HCFA authority to alter certain reimbursement rates that are not inherently reasonable, Medicare is proposing further inherent reasonableness reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates. See "Business -- Government Regulation." These reductions, if implemented, are expected to increase cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, decrease gross profit and decrease operating income for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction. The amount of the impact will be dependent upon product mix, the amount of product cost concessions that the Company is able to obtain from its suppliers and the number of patients serviced whose primary insurance coverage is Medicare.       Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased by $2,218,000 to $99,410,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 from $97,192,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues for the year ended September 30, 1999 increased to 64.2% in comparison to 62.6% for the year ended September 30, 1998. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues declined for patient services (68.1% for the year ended September 30, 1999 versus 69.4% for the year ended September 30, 1998), increased for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales (57.7% for the year ended September 30, 1999 versus 55.0% for the year ended September 30, 1998) and increased for infusion services (76.9% for the year ended September 30, 1999 versus 73.4% for the year ended September 30, 1998). The decrease in patient services is primarily due to increased billing rates. The increase in respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales is due to an increase in respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales in the U.S. Mail-Order Operations with higher product costs. The increase in infusion services is due to an increase in infusion therapies in the Hi-Tech Operations with higher product costs.       Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $5,966,000 or 11.5% to $57,946,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 from $51,980,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998. This increase was due to additional bad debt expense ($3,605,000) principally as a result of fully reserving for DermaQuest's accounts receivables (see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Accounts Receivable). In addition, there were higher levels of overhead in the U.K. Operations ($3,585,000) due to its continued expansion and the U.S. Mail-Order Operations incurred additional costs for overhead related to sales and collection efforts in the U.S. operations during the first half of fiscal 1999 ($1,942,000). Year ended September 30, 1999 included $1,392,000 of charges primarily related to the attempted acquisitions of Sinclair and Gateway and additional legal reserves versus $554,000 of charges included in fiscal 1998 primarily relating to costs incurred from its attempted acquisitions of Healthcall and Apria. These increases were offset by an overhead reduction program in the Mail-Order Operations ($2,642,000). The sale of TNI accounted for an additional decreases of $1,871,000.       Gain on Sale of Assets. For the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company recorded a $2,511,000                                         -24-   gain on the TNI Sale.       Operating (Loss) Income. The Company incurred an operating loss of $2,628,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 compared to operating income of $8,648,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998. Excluding the $1,392,000 of charges related to attempted acquisitions and additional legal reserves and $3,605,000 of additional bad debt expenses in the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company would have recorded operating income of $2,369,000.       Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $408,000 to $227,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 from $635,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998. This decrease was attributable to lower interest income earned on a lower level of funds invested.       Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $841,000 to $5,445,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 from $6,286,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998. This favorable variance was primarily attributable to a lower level of borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility combined with a reduced borrowing rate.       (Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. (Benefit) provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was a benefit of 6.4% for the year ended September 30, 1999 and a provision of 61.5% for the year ended September 30, 1998. The difference between the 6.4% effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 and the statutory tax rate resulted from non-deductible expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets.       Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient levels of taxable income in the future to realize the $11,369,000 net deferred tax assets comprised of the tax benefit associated with future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards, prior to their expiration (primarily 13 years or more). This belief is based upon, among other factors, changes in operations over the last few years, management's focus on its business realignment activities and current business strategies primarily with respect to its U.K. Operations. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. If this were to occur, management is committed to implementing tax planning strategies, such as the sale of net appreciated assets of the Company to the extent required (if any) to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of these benefits. Should such strategies be required, they could potentially result in the sale of a portion of the Company's interest in the U.K. Operations and repatriation of such proceeds to the U.S.       Net Loss (Income). As a result of the foregoing, the Company incurred a net loss of $7,346,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 compared to net income of $1,153,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998.       YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 VS. ELEVEN MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997.       Revenues. Total revenues increased by $61,865,000 or 66.2% to $155,309,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $93,444,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 with $13,153,000 accounting for the one additional month's revenue in fiscal 1998. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of eleven months of results for the year ended September 30, 1998 versus three months in the comparable prior period for Allied ($42,322,000 in patient services) and Omnicare ($16,735,000 in respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales), as well as an increase in respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales due primarily to an increase in the number of patients serviced in the Company's Mail-Order Operations ($5,395,000). These increases were partly offset by a decrease in patient services revenue attributable to the sale of Radamerica and the TNI Sale ($8,830,000), decreases in respiratory, medical                                         -25-   equipment and supplies sales due to exiting certain product lines of DermaQuest beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 ($2,719,000) as well as a reduction in revenue in the Mail-Order Operations due to the Balanced Budget Act ($1,846,000) and lower infusion services revenue ($1,836,000) due to a decline in number of patients serviced in the Hi-Tech Operations.       Pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act, a 10% reduction in Medicare reimbursement of diabetic testing strips and a 5% reduction in Medicare reimbursement of respiratory drugs became effective January 1, 1998. These reductions reduced revenue, increased cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues and decreased gross profit for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction (as discussed herein).       Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased by $45,805,000 to $97,192,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $51,387,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 with $7,920,000 accounting for the one additional month's cost of revenues in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues increased to 62.6% from 55.0% for the year ended September 30, 1998 and eleven months ended September 30, 1997, respectively. Cost of revenues as a percentage of sales increased for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales (55.0% for the year ended September 30, 1998 versus 48.9% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997) increased for patient services (69.4% for the year ended September 30, 1998 versus 60.8% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997) and increased for infusion services (73.4% for the year ended September 30, 1998 versus 68.6% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997). The increase in cost of revenues of respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 1998 are primarily attributable to the impact of the Balanced Budget Act, which reduced revenues for diabetic testing strips by 10% and respiratory drugs by 5% effective January 1, 1998 for Medicare patients and the inclusion of a full year of Omnicare's results (versus three months in the comparable period) which carry a higher cost of revenues (70.7%) than the U.S. respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales operations (47.6%). The increase in patient services costs as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 1998 are due to the inclusion of Allied's results for a full year (versus three months in the comparable prior period) which carry a cost of revenues of 69.4% and the sale of Radamerica in July 1997 which carried a lower cost of service (26.4%). The increase in infusion services is a result of an increase in therapies with higher product costs, as well as the effects of reduced reimbursement rates for certain payors.       Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9,049,000 or 21.1% to $51,980,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $42,931,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 with $4,217,000 accounting for the one additional month's expenses in fiscal 1998. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of eleven months of results for fiscal 1998 versus three months in the comparable prior period for the U.K. Operations ($12,952,000) and additional costs incurred for overhead related to sales efforts, collections and additional bad debt expense based upon a higher level of revenue. The increases were offset by the sale of Radamerica in July 1997 ($2,922,000). In addition, the Company recorded $554,000 of charges in fiscal 1998, primarily relating to costs incurred from its attempted acquisitions of Healthcall and Apria and $7,023,000 of additional bad debt expense in the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 primarily related to the Company's DermaQuest product lines ($6,060,000) and pulmonary rehabilitation center ($663,000).       Gain on Sale of Assets. For the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company recorded a $2,511,000 gain on the TNI Sale. For the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company recorded a $606,000 gain on the sale of Radamerica.       Special Charges. The Company recorded special charges of $16,677,000 during the eleven months                                         -26-   ended September 30, 1997 related to the following items: (i) $1,841,000 non-cash charge related to impairment of the investment in HMI as well as to record estimated costs, fees and other expenses related to completion of the HMI Asset Sale (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); (ii) $12,079,000 non-cash charge for the write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets related to exiting the wound care and orthotic product lines of the Company's DermaQuest subsidiary; (iii) $1,622,000 non-cash charge for the termination of the agreements to purchase the VIP Companies; (iv) $437,000 charge for closure of the Company's pulmonary rehabilitation center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey; and (v) $698,000 of other charges.       Equity in Loss of HMI, Net. Equity in loss of HMI was $18,076,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997. This represented 49% of HMI's loss for the six months ended July 31, 1997 after adjustments to book the Company's adjustment to historical goodwill amortization based on its fair value adjustments ($132,000) and to eliminate intercompany interest ($720,000). The 49% interest in HMI was acquired in mid January 1997 and was included in the results of operations effective February 1, 1997. Due to the Company's decision, during the third quarter of fiscal 1997, to sell HMI and the recording of HMI's obligations that the Company was required to fund, in connection with the sale to Counsel Corporation ("Counsel"), no equity in loss of HMI has been recorded subsequent to July 31, 1997.       Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $1,636,000 to $635,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $2,271,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 with $65,000 attributable to the one additional month's interest income in fiscal 1998. The gross decrease was primarily attributable to interest income earned (after elimination of intercompany interest) under a credit agreement with HMI ($1,417,000) for the eleven months of 1997 and lower interest income earned on a lower level of funds invested in fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal 1997.       Interest Expense. Interest expense, increased by $1,223,000 to $6,286,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $5,063,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 with $585,000 accounting for the one additional month's interest expense in fiscal 1998. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to an increased level of borrowings under the Credit Facility in the early part of fiscal 1998.       Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was a provision of 61.5% for the year ended September 30, 1998 and a benefit of 13.4% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997. The difference between the 61.5% effective tax rate for fiscal 1998 and the statutory tax rate resulted from non-deductible expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets.       Net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, were $8,674,000 at September 30, 1998, an increase of $970,000 from net deferred tax assets of $7,704,000 at September 30, 1997, primarily as a result of an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and federal net operating loss carryforwards. A valuation allowance, was provided for deferred tax assets where it was not likely that such assets would be realized through future income levels nor future or prior tax liabilities. During fiscal 1998, the Company decreased the valuation allowance by $114,000 primarily due to utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards.       Net Income (Loss). As a result of the foregoing, the Company produced net income of $1,153,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 compared to net loss of $32,735,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997.                                        -27-        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       GENERAL.       During the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company generated $3,258,000 from its operating activities. Cash flow from operating activities, combined with the use of existing cash, funded a $1,500,000 payment to further reduce the Company's Credit Facility and the following investing activities: $3,824,000 for further expansion of the Company's U.K. Operations and $2,642,000 for capital expenditures.       During the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company received $22,241,000 from investing activities as follows: $32,328,000 received from the HMI Asset Sale partly offset by $11,122,000 paid to complete the merger with HMI as well as for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger and to satisfy existing HMI obligations which were retained by the Company; $6,029,000 received from asset sales net of utilization of $3,346,000 for capital expenditures and $1,648,000 for acquisitions and purchases of other intangibles. Funds generated by investing activities along with net proceeds of $6,492,000 from the exercise of the Company's warrants were used to reduce the Company's borrowings under the Credit Facility by $29,100,000 and to fund operating activities.       During the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company utilized $130,302,000 ($117,138,000 net of proceeds from asset sales and other miscellaneous transactions) in investing activities as follows: $93,586,000 for the acquisition of the U.K. Operations (Omnicare and Allied); $32,189,000 for the purchase of 49% of HMI and HMI's senior debt and related advances; $2,694,000 for capital expenditures and $1,833,000 for acquisitions payable. In addition, the Company utilized $1,089,000 for operating activities. Substantially all of the financing for the operating and investing activities was provided by net borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility of $73,864,000, the equity investment by HPII and Hyperion TW Fund L.P. (the "Fund") aggregating $50,650,000 and proceeds of $12,100,000 from the sale of Radamerica.       The Company believes it has adequate capital resources to conduct its operations for the next twelve months. On December 20, 1999, the Company's U.K. subsidiaries completed a $124,500,000 refinancing which repaid the Company's existing senior indebtedness of $55,755,000 and provided funds for additional acquisitions in the U.K., subject to the terms of the refinancing agreements. See "-Refinancing."       ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.       The Company maintains a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 1999 and 1998, $30,814,000 (17.9%) and $32,223,000 (17.9%), respectively, of the Company's total assets consisted of accounts receivable substantially from third-party payors. Such payors generally required substantial documentation in order to process claims. The collection time for accounts receivable is typically the longest for services that relate to new patients or additional services requiring medical review for existing patients.       Accounts receivable decreased by $1,409,000 from September 30, 1998 to September 30, 1999 primarily due to the decision to fully reserve for the remaining DermaQuest accounts receivable ($2,205,000) (see below).       During fiscal 1996 and the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company experienced a significant increase in accounts receivable at its DermaQuest operation whose main product lines include wound care and orthotic products. Medicare, to whom substantially all DermaQuest claims are initially submitted for payment, has subjected these claims to an extensive review process and, in many cases, has required DermaQuest to pursue payment through the fair hearing process of the Medicare intermediary. This has created significant delays in payments, in many cases extending beyond twelve months, leading to the significant buildup in accounts receivable and corresponding negative impact on cash flow. The Company conducted an extensive review of the DermaQuest receivables in connection with the decision to discontinue these product lines in the continental U.S.                                         -28-   and, as a result, established additional reserves of $6,060,000 based on the potential inability to secure required documentation in a timely manner for reimbursement as a result of no longer being in these business lines. In establishing the net realizable value of its accounts receivable for DermaQuest, the Company had relied on its historical and anticipated payment experience. During fiscal 1999, the decision to fully reserve for the remaining DermaQuest accounts receivable was made in light of the Company's payment history over the first three quarters of fiscal 1999. During fiscal 1998 it appeared that collections of $1,013,000 on the remaining receivables during the fiscal year justified the carrying value at September 30, 1998 ($2,253,467). However, payments slowed dramatically during fiscal 1999. It only became apparent that this slow down was permanent in nature (and not a temporary issue) during the third quarter of fiscal 1999, as the total collected on the receivables year to date was $168,000, with only $37,000 collected during the third quarter. The decision was made to reserve the remaining receivables based on this evidence.       Management's goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry averages, which will tend to mitigate the risk of recurrence of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. Days sales outstanding ("DSOs") is a measure of the average number of days taken by the Company to collect its accounts receivable, calculated from the date services are rendered. For the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 and the Eleven Month Period, the Company's average DSOs were 73, 72 and 73, respectively.       CREDIT FACILITY.       The Credit Facility contained affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as interest coverage, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and minimum EBITDA. As of September 30, 1999, the Company was in technical default of the Credit Facility due to non-compliance with certain financial covenants (debt to EBITDA, interest coverage and minimum EBITDA). On December 20, 1999, the Company refinanced and repaid the Credit Facility with funds obtained in the Refinancing.       During the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company amended the Credit Facility to allow for further expansion of its U.K. Operations.       REFINANCING.       General. As described more fully below, on December 20, 1999, the Company's UK subsidiaries, Transworld Holdings (UK) Limited ("UK Parent") and its subsidiary Transworld Healthcare (UK) Limited ("TW UK") obtained an aggregate of $124,500,000 in new financing consisting of a $73,000,000 senior secured term and revolving credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility"), $16,000,000 in mezzanine indebtedness (the "Mezzanine Loan") and $36,000,000 principal amount of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") (each of the foregoing are sometimes referred to collectively herein as the "Refinancing"). $55,755,000 of the net proceeds of the Refinancing were used to repay the Company's existing Credit Facility, $11,000,000 was provided to the Company for general corporate purposes, with the balance to be used for acquisitions and working capital in the U.K., subject to the terms of the documents governing the Refinancing. In connection with the repayment of the Company's existing Credit Facility, the Company will record a non-cash, pre-tax, extraordinary charge of approximately $1,200,000 in its first quarter of fiscal 2000 relating to the write-off of the deferred financing costs associated with the Credit Facility.       Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility consists of a (i) $44,800,000 term loan A, maturing December 17, 2005, (ii) $20,000,000 acquisition term loan B, maturing December 17, 2006 which may be drawn upon during the first three years following closing, and (iii) $8,000,000 revolving facility, maturing                                         -29-   December 17, 2005. Repayment of the loans commences on July 30, 2000 and continues until final maturity. The loans bear interest at rates equal to LIBOR plus 2% to 2.75% per annum. As of January 3, 2000, TW UK had outstanding borrowings of $50,700,000 under the Senior Credit Facility. As of January 3, 2000, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of 7.7241% to 8.4741%.       Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Credit Facility prohibits or restricts, among other things, the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, certain fundamental corporate changes, dividends (including distributions to the Company), the making of specified investments and certain transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Senior Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as senior interest coverage, debt to EBITDA, fixed charge coverage and minimum net worth.       The loans under the Senior Credit Facility are collateralized by, among other things, a lien on substantially all of TW UK's and its subsidiaries' assets, a pledge of TW UK's ownership interest in its subsidiaries and guaranties by TW UK's subsidiaries.       Mezzanine Loan. The Mezzanine Loan is a term loan maturing December 17, 2007 and bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 7% per annum, where LIBOR plus 3.5% will be payable in cash, with the remaining interest being added to the principal amount of the loan. The Mezzanine Loan contains other terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in the Senior Credit Facility. The lenders of the Mezzanine Loan also received warrants to purchase 2% of the fully diluted ordinary shares of TW UK. As of January 3, 2000, borrowings under the Mezzanine Loan bore interest at a rate of 12.7204%.       Senior Subordinated Notes and Warrants. Notes. The Notes consist of $36,000,000 principal amount of senior subordinated notes of UK Parent purchased by several institutional investors and certain members of management (collectively, the "Investors"), plus equity warrants issued by TW UK concurrently with the sale of the Notes (the "Warrants") exercisable for ordinary shares of TW UK ("Warrant Shares") representing in the aggregate 27% of the fully diluted ordinary shares of TW UK. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions--Transactions with Directors and Executive Officers."       The Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.375% per annum payable quarterly in cash subject to restrictions contained in the Senior Credit Facility requiring UK Parent to pay interest in-kind through the issuance of additional notes ("PIK Notes") for the first 18 months, with payment of interest in cash thereafter subject to a fixed charge coverage test (provided that whenever interest cannot be paid in cash, additional PIK Notes shall be issued as payment in-kind of such interest). The Notes mature nine years from issuance.       UK Parent will not have the right to redeem the Notes and the PIK Notes except as provided in, and in accordance with the documents governing the issuance of the Notes and Warrants (herein the "Securities Purchase Documents").                                         -30-   The redemption price of the Notes and the PIK Notes will equal the principal amount of the Notes and the PIK Notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest on each.       The Investors have the right, at their option, to require UK Parent to redeem all or any portion of the Notes and the PIK Notes under certain circumstances and in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase Documents. The redemption price of the Notes and the PIK Notes shall be equal to the principal amount of the Notes and the PIK Notes, plus all accrued and unpaid interest on each.       UK Parent's redemption obligation of the Notes and the PIK Notes is guaranteed by TW UK, which guarantee is subordinated to the existing senior indebtedness of TW UK to the same extent as the Notes and the PIK Notes are subordinated to senior indebtedness of UK Parent. If UK Parent fails to perform in full its obligations following exercise of the Investors put of Notes and TW UK fails to perform its obligations as a guarantor of such obligations, the Investors shall have the right to among other things exercise directly (through the voting trust described below) the drag-along rights described without the requirement that the Board of Directors of TW UK first take any action.       Warrants. The Warrants may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time, unless previously purchased or cancelled upon a redemption of the Notes, at the option of the holders prior to the time of maturity of the Notes for Warrant Shares representing approximately 27% of TW UK's fully diluted ordinary share capital, subject to antidilution adjustment as contained in the Securities Purchase Documents.       The exercise price of the Warrants shall equal the entire principal amount of the Notes (other than PIK Notes and excluding any accrued unpaid interest) for all Warrants in the aggregate and must be paid through the tender of Notes (other than PIK Notes) to TW UK, whereby TW UK shall issue to the Investors the appropriate number of Warrant Shares and pay to the Investors in cash an amount equal to the principal amount of the PIK Notes and all accrued unpaid interest on the Notes and the PIK Notes.       The Warrants will automatically be exercised for Warrant Shares in the event that TW UK consummates                                         -31-   a public offering of shares valuing the Investors ordinary shares of TW UK issuable upon a voluntary exercise of the Warrants at or above 2.5x the initial investment.       The Investors will have the right, at their option, to require UK Parent to purchase all or any portion of the Warrants or the Warrant Shares under certain circumstances and in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase Documents. The purchase price of the Warrants shall be equal to the difference, if a positive number, between (i) the fair market value of the Warrant Shares which the Investors have the right to acquire upon exercise of such Warrants and (ii) the exercise price of such Warrants. The purchase price of the Warrant Shares shall be equal to the fair market value of such Warrant Shares.       UK Parent's purchase obligation of the Warrants is guaranteed by TW UK, which guarantee is subordinated to existing senior indebtedness of TW UK. If UK Parent fails to perform in full its obligations following exercise of the Investors put of Warrants and TW UK fails to perform its obligations as a guarantor of such obligations, the Investors shall have the right to among other things exercise directly through the voting trust the drag-along rights without the requirement that the Board of Directors of TW UK first take any action.       If UK Parent fails to perform in full its obligations following exercise of the Investors put of Warrant Shares, the Investors shall have the right to among other things exercise directly through the voting trust the drag-along rights without the requirement that the Board of Directors of TW UK first take any action.       Following an initial public offering and upon exchange of the Warrants the Investors shall be entitled to two demand and unlimited piggyback registrations with respect to the Warrant Shares. The Warrant Shares shall be listed for trading on any securities exchange on which the ordinary shares of TW UK are listed for trading.                                        -32-         All ordinary shares of UK Parent owned by the Company and all ordinary shares of TW UK owned by UK Parent are held in a voting trust for the benefit of the holders of ordinary shares of TW UK and the holders of the Warrants, with the trustee of the trust being obligated to vote the shares held in trust as follows: (i) to elect to the Board of Directors of TW UK individuals designated in accordance with the Securities Purchase Documents and on any other matter, pursuant to instructions approved by the required majority of the Board of Directors of TW UK as contemplated by the Securities Purchase Documents; and (ii) following the breach by UK Parent and TW UK of their obligations to honor an Investor put of Notes, an Investor put of Warrants or an Investor put of Warrant Shares, the Investors have the right to exercise drag-along rights directly without any action of the Board of Directors of TW UK on a transaction to which such drag-along rights apply pursuant to instructions from the Investors. G. Richard Green, a Director of the Company, is the trustee of the voting trust. The voting trust includes provisions to the effect that under certain circumstances the shares held in trust shall thereafter be voted on all matters, including the election of directors, pursuant to instructions from a majority of those members of the Board of Directors of TW UK who are not affiliated or associated with the Company, HPII, or any of their successors.       The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect of the provisions of the voting trust and other aspects of the Refinancing on its ability to continue to consolidate the operations of TW UK in its fiscal 2000 financial statements.       The Articles of Association of TW UK and the Securities Purchase Documents provide that neither UK Parent nor TW UK will enter into any transaction with or make contributions to the Company or UK Parent (except as required by the terms of the Notes, the Warrants or the Warrant Shares) in the form of dividends, fees, re-charges, loans, guarantees or any other benefit, in any form, unless they have been previously agreed upon by all shareholders.       The Securities Purchase Documents also provide that the Investors will have the benefit of customary shareholder rights for a transaction of this type including, without limitation: (i) pre-emptive rights with respect to new securities; (ii) rights of first refusal with respect to proposed transfers of ordinary shares of TW UK; (iii) drag-along rights; (iv) tag-along rights; and (v) the exercise of voting rights by the holders of the Warrants as therein described including the right to elect one director to the TW UK Board of Directors. The Securities Purchase Documents also include limitations on TW UK's ability to do the following, among others, without the consent of the Investors: (i) issue additional equity securities of TW UK; (ii) pay dividends or make other restricted payments, except as required by the terms of the Notes, the Warrants or the Warrant Shares; (iii) sell, lease or otherwise dispose of assets exceeding specified values; (iv) enter into any transactions with affiliates; (v) amend the Memorandum or Articles of Association; or (vi) merge or consolidate with another entity.       TNI SALE.       On July 15, 1998, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its domestic home nursing                                         -33-   subsidiary for $5,300,000 which was paid in cash at closing. Subject to the terms of the agreement, $300,000 of such amount was placed into escrow for a period of one year following the closing to secure TNI's obligations under the agreement. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce borrowings under the Credit Facility ($4,100,000) and to satisfy transaction costs and liabilities that were retained by the Company.       ACQUISITION OF HMI/SALE TO COUNSEL.       On October 1, 1997, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the merger with HMI. Under the terms of a merger agreement, HMI stockholders received $.30 in cash for each outstanding share of HMI common stock not already owned by the Company. Concurrently with the closing of the merger, the Company completed the HMI Asset Sale to Counsel for $40,000,000 at which time substantially all of the businesses and operations of HMI were sold to Counsel. Of the $40,000,000 proceeds, $30,000,000 was received in cash with $7,500,000 to be paid to the Company as HMI's accounts receivable, existing at date of sale, were collected, with the remaining $2,500,000 held in escrow for post-closing adjustments. As of September 30, 1999 an aggregate (including interest earned on such escrow funds) of $37,648,000 was received (including the $7,500,000 escrow that was held for accounts receivable collection) of which, $25,000,000 was used to reduce the senior secured debt owed by the Company under the Credit Facility, $2,800,000 was used to complete the merger and the remainder was used for costs, fees and other expenses to complete the HMI Asset Sale as well as to satisfy liabilities not assumed by Counsel. The remaining $2,500,000 escrow was fully utilized for post-closing adjustments.       Pursuant to the HMI Asset Sale, Counsel did not assume any liabilities of HMI other than certain liabilities arising after the closing under assumed contracts and certain employee-related liabilities. Liabilities not assumed by Counsel, as well as certain wind-down and contingent obligations of HMI (including litigation - see "Legal Proceedings" with respect to certain legal proceedings concerning HMI), were recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with purchase accounting.       YEAR 2000.       General. The Year 2000 computer issue refers to potential conditions in computer programs whereby a two-digit field rather than a four-digit field is used to define the applicable year. Unless corrected, some computer programs may not appropriately function as of January 1, 2000 because these programs will read the "00" in the year 2000 as January 1, 1900. If uncorrected, the problem could have resulted in computer system failures or equipment and medical device malfunctions (affecting patient diagnosis and treatment) thereby disrupting the Company's business operations and subjecting the Company to potentially significant legal liabilities.       During the early part of 1998, the Company formed a task force consisting of members of senior management, in-house legal counsel, representatives from each of the Company's operating subsidiaries (in both the U.K. and the U.S.), and other Company personnel. The task force also consulted with the Company's insurance carrier and risk management advisors. The task force developed an action plan to address the potential problems of the Year 2000, which considered the following critical phases: (i) the Company's state of readiness; (ii) risks of the Company's Year 2000 issues; (iii) costs to address Year 2000 compliance; and (iv) the Company's contingency plans.       Company's State of Readiness. The information technology ("IT") and IT infrastructure portions of the Company's Year 2000 project, addressed the inventory, assessment, necessary corrective actions, testing and implementation of external vendor products, mission critical third-party software and internally developed                                         -34-   software. In that regard, the Company believes it has identified (in both the U.K. and the U.S.), the various software applications that may have been potentially impacted. The Company's assessment of all IT related components has been completed and any remediation of external vendor products, mission critical third-party software and internally developed software has been completed. The Company has also implemented and tested all remediation.       With respect to the non-IT portion of the Company's Year 2000 project, the Company had undertaken a program to inventory, assess and correct or replace (where necessary) impacted mission critical as well as non-mission critical vendor and supplier products (including but not limited to drugs, medical supplies and specialty mail-order pharmaceutical products), medical equipment, telephone systems, postage machines and other related equipment with Year 2000 risk. These types of supplies and equipment play a vital role in the day to day operations of the Company. The Company had implemented (in both the U.K. and the U.S.), a program of contacting vendors and suppliers, analyzing and acting upon information provided to replace or otherwise amend any devices or equipment that pose a Year 2000 impact. The Company had prioritized its non-IT efforts by allocating resources to equipment and medical devices that would have a direct impact on patient safety and health with a goal of minimizing and/or eliminating the associated risks. The Company recognizes, to a certain degree, that it has relied upon information that was being provided by equipment and medical device manufacturers regarding the Year 2000 status of their respective products. While the Company has attempted to evaluate information provided by its present vendors and suppliers, there can be no assurance that in all instances accurate information was provided. The Company's assessment of potentially non-IT affected components has been completed and any required corrective actions have been completed. The Company has also implemented and tested all remediation.       Lastly, the Company relies heavily upon third party payors, including to a large extent governmental payors such as the NHS in the U.K. and Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. for accurate and timely reimbursement of claims, often through the use of electronic data interfaces. Although much has been published publicly stating that the government was working to solve its own Year 2000 issues in a timely manner, the Company has received no assurance that their systems and interfaces were converted timely. Failure of any of the Company's third party payors, especially governmental payors, to solve their Year 2000 issues could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.       Risks of the Company's Year 2000 Issues. Failure from any of the aforementioned IT and/or non-IT equipment and components, including the support from third parties, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operations (in both the U.K. and the U.S.) resulting in the potential inability to provide health care services to its patients. This inability could result in the loss of revenue (which at the present time is unable to be quantified) and give rise to litigation. Failure of the third party payor's systems also could have a material adverse affect on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.       Costs to Address Year 2000 Compliance. As of January 3, 2000, costs incurred for all efforts of the Company's Year 2000 action plan amounted to $245,000 and have not been material to the Company. These costs have been expensed as incurred and have been funded by operating cash flows. Based upon the best estimate by the Company's management and the Year 2000 task force, the Company does not expect any additional costs associated with the Company's Year 2000 action plan. If additional costs are incurred they will also be expensed as incurred and be funded by operating cash flow.       The Company's Contingency Plans. Each operating subsidiary (both in the U.K. and the U.S.) has been asked to develop a contingency plan to restore the material functions of each of its systems or activities in the case of a Year 2000 failure. To date, there have been no material malfunctions of the Company's systems or                                        -35-   activities due to Year 2000 issues.       However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated events still will not occur or that the Company was able to identify all Year 2000 issues before problems arise. In addition, the Company has no assurance that third party payors and vendors have or had the ability to identify and solve all or substantially all their Year 2000 issues. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Year 2000 issue still will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.       LITIGATION.       See "Legal Proceedings" with respect to certain legal proceedings concerning the Company and HMI.       IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 addresses the accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. As the Company currently does not enter into transactions involving derivative instruments, the Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. As issued, SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999, with earlier application encouraged. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133," which amended the effective date of SFAS No. 133 for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.
