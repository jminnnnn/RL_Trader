ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  GENERAL  The Company is a provider of a broad range of health care services and products with principal operations in the U.K. and the U.S. The Company provides the following services and products: (i) patient services, including nursing and para-professional services; (ii) respiratory therapy and home medical equipment; and (iii) infusion therapy. The Company provides these services and products from the following two reportable business segments: (i) U.K. operations and (ii) U.S. Home Healthcare operations (formerly Hi-Tech). The Company's U.K. operations supply nursing and para-professional care to the community and U.K. healthcare institutions and medical grade oxygen to the U.K. pharmacy market and private patients in Northern Ireland. The Company's Home Healthcare operations are concentrated in New Jersey and New York.  The Company was a provider of specialty mail-order pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. On October 3, 2000, the Company sold a substantial portion of the assets of its U.S. Mail-Order Operations and subsequently closed this business segment. In addition, on November 22, 2000, the Company sold its U.K. subsidiary Amcare. (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  On December 20, 1999, the Company's U.K. subsidiaries obtained new financing. Concurrent with the Refinancing, the Company placed 100% of its ownership interest in TW UK into a Voting Trust (as further defined and described in Liquidity and Capital Resources). As a result of the provisions of the Voting Trust the Company did not control a majority of the board of directors and the holders of the senior subordinated notes issued pursuant to the Refinancing held substantive rights, principally in the form of their ability to approve the annual budget and financial forecast of results of operations and sources and uses of cash. As a result of these rights, for accounting purposes the Company was no longer able to consolidate the U.K. subsidiaries into its financial statements although it owned 100% of the outstanding shares of the stock of the parent company, UK Parent, as of December 31, 1999. Therefore, effective with the Refinancing, the Company began accounting for the investment in UK Parent and its subsidiaries under the equity method, retroactive to October 1, 1999. During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, UK Parent and TW UK amended their Articles of Association to give the Chairman (a Company designee) the right to resolve any tie votes of the board of directors and certain documents covering the Notes (as defined and described in Liquidity and Capital Resources) were amended to eliminate the requirement that the Investors approve the operating budget. These amendments have enabled the Company to consolidate the U.K. subsidiaries as of January 1, 2000.  The Company's revenue mix and payor mix is influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles. The following table shows the percentage of historical net revenues represented by each of the Company's product lines:                                              Year Ended        Year Ended         Year Ended                                          September 30,     September 30,      September 30,                                               2001              2000               1999                                               ----              -----              ---- Product Line - ------------        Net patient services...................      84.5%              59.2%              51.8% Net respiratory, medical   equipment and supplies sales.......         7.4               32.2               42.2 Net infusion services..................       8.1                8.6                6.0                                             -----              -----              -----                   Total revenues.......     100.0%             100.0%             100.0%                                             =====              =====              =====                                         -18-   The increase in net patient services as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2001 as compared to 2000 is primarily due to growth in the Company's U.K. flexible staffing business both organically and through the on-going nursing and care agency acquisition program. The decrease in net respiratory medical equipment and supplies sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended September 30, 2001 as compared to 2000 is due primarily to the closing of the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations and the sale of Amcare, in November 2000. On a pro forma basis, assuming the U.K. subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended September 30, 2000, the percentage of total revenues would have been as follows: net patient services 62.3%, net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales 30.7% and net infusion services 7.0%.  The following table shows the historical payor mix for the Company's total revenues for the periods presented:                                             Year Ended        Year Ended         Year Ended                                          September 30,     September 30,      September 30,                                               2001              2000               1999                                               ----              -----              ---- Payor - -----        U.K. NHS and other U.K.   Governmental payors............             54.7%               43.6%             36.5% Medicare.........................              1.6                14.7              20.9 Medicaid.........................              2.1                 3.3               2.2 Private payors...................             41.6                38.4              40.4                                             ------               ------            -----          Total revenues..........           100.0%               100.0%            100.0%                                             =====                =====             =====   The increase in NHS and other U.K. governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2001 as compared to 2000 is primarily due to the U.K. acquisitions which derive the majority of their revenues from the NHS, and to organic growth in the core flexible staffing business. The decrease in Medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2001 as compared to 2000 is primarily due to the Company exiting the U.S. Mail-Order Operations. The Company believes that its payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and to a lesser extent, from shifts in existing business among payors.  The increase in NHS and other U.K. governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000 as compared to 1999 is primarily due to the acquisition of Nightingale, which derives the majority of its revenues from the NHS, and to organic growth in the core flexible staffing business. The decrease in Medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000 as compared to 1999 is primarily due to the decrease in revenue in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations.  The Company believes that a substantial portion of its revenues derived from private payors in the U.S. was subject to case management and managed care and that this relationship will continue in the future. The Company maintains a diversified offering of home services and products in an attempt to mitigate the impact of potential reimbursement reductions for any individual product or service.  The Company's gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of its product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates. The Company historically has recognized higher gross margins from its specialized mail-order and medical supplies pharmacy and respiratory therapy operations than from its nursing and infusion therapy operations. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin.                                         -19-    At September 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company had $109,426,000 and $90,786,000, respectively of intangible assets (primarily goodwill) on its balance sheet. This represented 44.1% of total assets and 301.0% of total stockholders' equity at September 30, 2001 and 49.4% of total assets and 144.0% of total stockholders' equity at September 30, 2000. Amortization of intangibles for the years ended September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $3,852,000, $3,301,000 and $3,459,000, respectively. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to increase the amount of intangible assets on the balance sheet. On a pro forma basis, assuming the U.K. subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended September 30, 2000, amortization of intangibles would have been $4,065,000.  The Company amortizes goodwill over periods ranging from ten to forty years based on the likely period of time over which related economic benefits will be realized. The Company believes its estimated goodwill life is reasonable given, among other factors, the continuing movement of patient care to non-institutional settings, expanding demand due to demographic trends, the emphasis of the Company on establishing coverage in each of its local and regional markets and the consistent practice of other home health care companies. At each balance sheet date, or if a significant adverse change occurs in the Company's business, management assesses the carrying amount of enterprise goodwill. The Company measures impairment of goodwill by comparing the future undiscounted cash flows (without interest) to the carrying amount of goodwill. This evaluation is done at the reportable business segment level (primarily by subsidiary). If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the future cash flows, the excess carrying amount of goodwill is written off. The factors considered by management in estimating future cash flows include current operating results, the effects of any current or proposed changes in third-party reimbursement or other governmental regulations, trends and prospects of acquired businesses, as well as the effect of demand, competition, market and other economic factors. If permanent impairment of goodwill were to be recognized in a future period, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.  In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 141 ("FAS 141"), "Business Combinations", and Statement No. 142 ("FAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". The provisions of FAS 141 are effective for business combinations accounted for by the purchase method and completed after June 30, 2001. The provisions of FAS 142 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. FAS 141 changes the accounting for business combinations by, among other things, prohibiting the prospective use of pooling-of-interests accounting. Under FAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests. In accordance with the transitional provisions of FAS 142, the Company has not amortized goodwill acquired in business combinations subsequent to June 30, 2001. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 VS. YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000  Revenues. Total revenues for the years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000 were $154,633,000 and $135,408,000, respectively, an increase of $19,225,000 or 14.2%. This increase relates primarily to the change in accounting for the U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 ($28,847,000) and increased revenues in the Company's U.K. nursing operations as a result of acquisitions and an increase in billable hours charged ($28,418,000). The U.S. Home Healthcare operations also experienced an increase in revenues ($1,108,000) primarily due to an increase in the number of patients being serviced. These increases were partially offset by the Company's exit of the U.S. Mail-Order Operations effective October 2000 ($22,476,000) and to the sale of Amcare in November 2000 ($16,667,000).                                         -20-   Gross Profit. Total gross profit increased by $2,352,000 to $47,979,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001 from $45,627,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2001 decreased to 31.0% from 33.7% for the prior year. The decrease in gross margins is principally due to growth in the Company's U.K. nursing operations and the closing of the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations, which realized historical gross margins in excess of 50%. Gross margins for patient services were essentially flat year over year (30.7% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 31% for the prior year). Gross margins in the respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales decreased slightly (37.9% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 40.3% for the prior year) principally due to the sale of Amcare in November 2000 and slightly increased for infusion services (28.4% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 27.6% for the prior year) principally due to product mix.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000 were $41,265,000 and $49,041,000, respectively. This represents a decrease in the current year of $7,776,000 or 15.9%. This decrease relates primarily to the decrease in the U.S. Mail-Order Operations due to the Company's decision to exit this business in September of 2000 ($15,946,000) and the sale of Amcare in November 2000 ($2,920,000). Partly offsetting this decrease is the change in accounting for the U.K. subsidiaries from the equity method to consolidation ($6,347,000) as well as higher levels of overhead costs in the U.K. operations principally due to acquisitions and to support internal growth ($5,016,000). Overhead costs in the Company's U.S. corporate offices also decreased ($663,000) principally due to headcount reductions and other cost saving initiatives.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a $15,073,000 charge related to the write-down of assets to their fair value for the U.S. Mail-Order Operations and Amcare (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Losses due to Sale of Subsidiary. For the year ended September 30, 2001, the Company recorded losses of $354,000 due to the sale of Amcare as a result of the completion of the transaction.  Legal Settlements, Net. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a one-time charge of $10,082,000 related to a settlement with the federal government which was offset by a $5,000,000 settlement with the Prior Owners (see "Business - Government Regulation").  Restructuring Charge. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge related to exiting and closing its U.S. Mail-Order Operations (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Interest Income. Total interest income for the years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000 was $1,587,000 and $1,443,000, respectively. The increase was attributable to higher interest income earned ($84,000) on a higher level of funds invested. This increase was partially offset by the change in accounting for the U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 ($60,000).  Interest Expense. Total interest expense for the years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000 was $10,020,000 and $9,290,000, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of average borrowings outstanding. This increase was partially offset by the change in accounting for the U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 ($308,000).                                          -21-   Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $24,117,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus a benefit of $7,348,000 or 22.4% of loss before income taxes, equity income, minority interest and extraordinary loss for the year ended September 30, 2000. The difference between the current year provision and the statutory tax rate resulted principally from the establishment of a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.  Management had been previously committed to implementing tax strategies that provided for the sale of appreciated assets, including a portion of the Company's ownership interest in its U.K. subsidiary, to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the tax net operating losses prior to their expiration. While the Company believes it will eventually realize the value of its tax losses, current developments, including the continued expansion of the U.K. operations has increased the uncertainty as to both the execution of the original strategy and the appropriateness of a tax strategy which may not align with the Company's current business strategy. These uncertainties have impaired the Company's ability to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance for all remaining deferred tax assets has been provided.  Equity in Income of and Interest Income Earned from U.K. Subsidiaries. Equity in income of U.K. subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $319,000, which represents 100% of the net income of the Company's U.K. subsidiaries for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 (See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest income earned from U.K. subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $782,000 (net of tax provision of $421,000), which represents interest income on an intercompany loan, which was repaid on December 20, 2000, concurrent with the Refinancing. There was no equity in income of and interest income earned from U.K. subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2001 as the Company consolidated its U.K. subsidiaries in the current fiscal year.  Minority Interest. The Company reported a charge for minority interest of $22,000 in the year ended September 30, 2001 compared to a benefit $70,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000. The minority interest represents the 1,050,000 shares of class A1 common stock of TW UK issued as part of the Nightingale consideration (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Extraordinary Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. An extraordinary loss (net of tax benefit of $408,000) of $759,000 was recorded in the year ended September 30, 2000, as a result of the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the early extinguishment of borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility.  Net Loss. As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $26,612,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001 compared to a loss of $24,944,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000.  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 VS. YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999  Revenues. Total reported revenues for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 were $135,408,000 and $154,728,000, respectively. This represents a decrease of $19,320,000 or 12.5%. This decrease relates primarily to the change in accounting for the U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 ($24,489,000) and declines in revenue experienced by the U.S. Mail-Order Operations ($14,554,000) due to a reduction in the number of patients serviced. Partly offsetting these decreases were increased revenues in the Company's U.K. nursing operations, subsequent to January 1, 2000, ($17,945,000) as a result of acquisitions (including $10,325,000 from Nightingale) and an increase in the billable hours. The Home Healthcare operations also experienced an increase in revenues ($2,336,000) primarily due to an increase in the number of patients being serviced.                                        -22-   Cost of Revenues. Total reported cost of revenues for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 was $89,781,000 and $99,410,000, respectively. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000 increased to 66.3% in comparison to 64.2% for the year ended September 30, 1999. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased slightly for patient services (69.0% for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus 68.1% for the year ended September 30, 1999) and for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales (59.7% for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus 57.7% for the year ended September 30, 1999) and decreased for infusion services (72.4% for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus 76.9% for the year ended September 30, 1999). The increase in patient services costs is primarily due to the acquisition of Nightingale, which has a higher cost of revenue (82.0%) than the historical U.K. nursing operations (67.1%). The increase in respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales costs is principally attributable to higher delivery costs in the U.K. Operations. The decrease in infusion services costs is due to an increase in volume of higher gross margin infusion therapies in the Home Healthcare operations.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Reported selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 were $49,041,000 and $57,946,000, respectively. This represents a decrease in the current year of $8,905,000 or 15.4%. The change in accounting for the U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 accounted for $5,070,000 of the decrease. The recording of additional bad debt expense of $3,655,000 (principally as a result of fully reserving for DermaQuest's accounts receivable) and $2,030,000 of charges primarily related to the attempted acquisitions of Sinclair Montrose Healthcare ("Sinclair") and Gateway Homecare, Inc. ("Gateway") and additional legal costs during the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999 added to the decrease. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations due to an overhead reduction program ($2,165,000). Overhead costs in the Company's U.S. Corporate offices also decreased ($537,000) principally due to headcount reductions. These decreases were offset by higher levels of overhead in the U.K. operations, subsequent to January 1, 2000, principally due to its acquisitions ($3,170,000). These decreases were also offset by the net increase in bad debt expense in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations as a result of valuing accounts receivable to net realizable value ($3,180,000) which was offset by declines in revenue resulting in reduced bad debt charges ($1,697,000).  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a $15,073,000 charge related to the write-down of assets to their fair value for the U.S. Mail-Order Operations and Amcare (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Legal Settlements, Net. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a one-time charge of $10,082,000 related to a settlement with the federal government which was offset by a $5,000,000 settlement with the Prior Owners (see "Business - Government Regulation").  Restructuring Charge. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge related to exiting and closing its U.S. Mail-Order Operations (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Interest Income. Reported interest income for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 was $1,443,000 and $227,000, respectively. The increase was attributable to higher interest income earned ($1,276,000) on a higher level of funds invested partially offset by the change in accounting for the U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 ($60,000).  Interest Expense. Reported interest expense for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 was $9,290,000 and $5,445,000, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of borrowings combined with higher borrowing rates under the Refinancing than the Company's Credit Facility($4,153,000). This increase was                                          -23-   partially offset by the change in accounting for the U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 ($308,000).  Benefit for Income Taxes. The Company recorded a benefit for income taxes amounting to $7,348,000 or 22.4% of loss before income taxes, equity income, minority interest and extraordinary loss for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus $500,000 or 6.4% of loss for the year ended September 30, 1999. The difference between the 22.4% effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 and the statutory tax rate resulted from non-deductible expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets, the legal settlements and foreign capital gains tax on the sale of Amcare.  Management believed that it was more likely than not that the Company would generate sufficient levels of taxable income in the future to realize the $20,961,000 of reported net deferred tax assets comprised of the tax benefit associated with future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards, prior to their expiration (primarily 12 years or more). This belief was based upon, among other factors, management's focus on its business realignment activities and business strategies primarily with respect to its U.K. Operations.  Equity in Income of and Interest Income Earned from U.K. Subsidiaries. Equity in income of U.K. subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $319,000, which represents 100% of the net income of the Company's U.K. subsidiaries for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 (See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest income earned from U.K. subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $782,000 (net of tax provision of $421,000), which represents interest income on an intercompany loan, which was repaid on December 20, 2000, concurrent with the Refinancing. There was no equity in income of and interest income earned from U.K. subsidiaries for the entire year ended September 30, 1999 as the Company consolidated its U.K. subsidiaries in fiscal 1999.  Minority Interest. The Company reported a benefit from minority interest of $70,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000. The minority interest represents the 1,050,000 shares of class A1 common stock of TW UK issued as part of the Nightingale consideration (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Extraordinary Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. An extraordinary loss (net of tax benefit of $408,000) of $759,000 was recorded in the year ended September 30, 2000, as a result of the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the early extinguishment of borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility.  Net Loss. As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $24,944,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000 compared to $7,346,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999.  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 VS. PRO FORMA YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000  The following comparisons of year ended September 30, 2001 as compared to pro forma September 30, 2000 present the pro forma statement of operations data as if the U.K. subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended September 30, 2000.  Revenues. Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2001 were $154,633,000 as compared to pro forma revenues of $164,255,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000, which represents a decrease of $9,622,000 or 5.9%. This decrease was primarily attributable to exiting the U.S. Mail-Order Operations ($22,476,000) and the sale of Amcare ($16,667,000). The impact of exiting these businesses was substantially offset with increased revenues in the Company's U.K. nursing operations ($28,418,000) as a result of acquisitions and an increase in the number of billable hours. The U.S. Home Healthcare operations also experienced an increase in revenues ($1,108,000) primarily due to an increase in the number of patients being serviced.                                        -24-   Gross Profit. Total gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2001was $47,979,000 as compared to pro forma gross profit of $54,620,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2001 decreased to 31.0% from 33.3% pro forma for the prior year. The decrease in gross margins is principally due to growth in the Company's U.K. nursing operations and the closing of the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations, which realized historical gross margins in excess of 50%. Gross margins for patient services were essentially flat year over year (30.7% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 31.3% pro forma for the prior year). Gross margins in the respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales decreased slightly (37.9% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 38.53% pro forma for the prior year) principally due to the sale of Amcare in November 2000 and slightly increased for infusion services (28.4% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 27.6% pro forma for the prior year) principally due to product mix.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2001 were $41,265,000 as compared to pro forma $55,592,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000, which represents a decrease of $14,327,000 or 25.8%. This decrease was primarily attributable to exiting the U.S. Mail-Order Operations ($15,945,000) and the sale of Amcare ($2,920,000). This decrease was partly offset with increased costs principally in the U.K. operations due to acquisitions and to support internal growth ($5,016,000). Overhead costs in the Company's U.S. Corporate offices also decreased ($663,000) principally due to headcount reductions and other cost saving initiatives.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a $15,073,000 charge related to the write-down of assets to their fair value for the U.S. Mail-Order Operations and Amcare (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Legal Settlements, Net. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a one-time charge of $10,082,000 related to a settlement with the federal government which was offset by a $5,000,000 settlement with the Prior Owners (see "Business - Government Regulation").  Restructuring Charge. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge related to exiting and closing its U.S. Mail-Order Operations (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Interest Income. Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2001 was $1,587,000 as compared to pro forma $1,503,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000, which represents an increase of $84,000. This increase was attributable to higher interest income earned on a higher level of funds invested.  Interest Expense. Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2001 was $10,020,000 as compared to pro forma $9,598,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000, which represents an increase of $422,000. This variance was primarily attributable to a higher level of borrowings outstanding.  (Provision)Benefit for Income Taxes. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2001 of $24,117,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus a pro forma benefit of $6,254,000 or 20.5% of loss before income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2000. The difference between the current year provision and the statutory tax rate resulted principally from the establishment of a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.  Management had been previously committed to implementing tax strategies that provided for the sale of appreciated assets, including a portion of the Company's ownership interest in its U.K. subsidiary, to generate sufficient taxable                                          -25-   income to realize the tax net operating losses prior to their expiration. While the Company believes it will eventually realize the value of its tax losses, current developments, including the continued expansion of the U.K. operations has increased the uncertainty as to both the execution of the original strategy and the appropriateness of a tax strategy which may not align with the Company's current business strategy. These uncertainties have impaired the Company's ability to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance for all remaining deferred tax assets has been provided.  Minority Interest. The Company reported a charge for minority interest of $22,000 in the year ended September 30, 2001 compared to a benefit $70,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000. The minority interest represents the 1,050,000 shares of class A1 common stock of TW UK issued as part of the Nightingale consideration (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Extraordinary Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. On a pro forma basis, the Company still would have reported an extraordinary loss (net of tax benefit of $408,000) of $759,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000, as a result of the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the early extinguishment of borrowings under the Credit Facility.  Net Loss. As a result of the foregoing, the Company still would have reported a net loss of $26,612,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001 compared to pro forma $24,944,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000.  PRO FORMA YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 VS. YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999  The following comparisons of pro forma year ended September 30, 2000 as compared to September 30, 1999 present the pro forma statement of operations data as if the U.K. subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended September 30, 2000.  Revenues. Total pro forma revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000 were $164,255,000 as compared to $154,728,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999, which represents an increase of $9,527,000 or 6.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to increased revenues in the Company's U.K. nursing operations ($22,132,000) as a result of acquisitions (including $10,325,000 from Nightingale) and an increase in the number of billable hours. Also contributing to the increase was increased revenues in the Home Healthcare operations ($2,336,000). Partly offsetting the increases from the U.K. and Home Healthcare operations were declines in revenue experienced by the Mail-Order Operations ($14,554,000) due to a reduction in the number of patients serviced.  Cost of Revenues. Pro forma cost of goods sold for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $109,635,000 as compared to $99,410,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999. On a pro forma basis total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to 66.7% from 64.2% in the year ended September 30, 2000. On a pro forma basis cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales (61.5% for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus 57.7% for the year ended September 30, 1999), decreased for infusion services (72.4% for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus 76.9% for the year ended September 30, 1999) and increased slightly for patient services (68.7% for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus 68.1% for the year ended September 30, 1999). The increase in respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales operations costs is attributable to higher delivery costs in the U.K. Operations. The decrease in infusion services costs is due to an increase in volume of higher gross margin infusion therapies in the Home Healthcare Operations. Patient services costs increased slightly due to the acquisition of Nightingale, which has a higher cost of revenue (82.0%) than the historical U.K. nursing operations (67.2%).                                        -26-   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Pro forma selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2000 were $55,592,000 as compared to $57,946,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999, which represents a decrease of $2,354,000 or 4.1%. This decrease was primarily due to the recording of additional bad debt expense of $3,655,000 (principally as a result of fully reserving for DermaQuest's accounts receivable) and $2,030,000 of charges primarily related to the attempted acquisitions of Sinclair and Gateway and additional legal costs during the year ended September 30, 1999. In addition, selling, general and administrative expensed decreased in the Company's Mail-Order Operations due to an overhead reduction program ($2,165,000). Overhead costs in the Company's U.S. Corporate offices also decreased ($333,000) principally due to headcount reductions. These decreases were offset by higher levels of overhead in the U.K. Operations principally due to its acquisitions and internal growth ($4,447,000). These decrease were also offset by the net increase in bad debt expense in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations as a result of valuing accounts receivable to net realizable value ($3,180,000) which was offset by declines in revenue resulting in reduced bad debt charges ($1,697,000).  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a $15,073,000 charge related to the write-down of assets to their fair value for the U.S. Mail-Order Operations and Amcare (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Legal Settlements, Net. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a one-time charge of $10,082,000 related to a settlement with the federal government which was offset by a $5,000,000 settlement with the Prior Owners (see "Business - Government Regulation").  Restructuring Charge. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge related to exiting and closing its U.S. Mail-Order Operations (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Interest Income. Pro forma interest income for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $1,503,000 as compared to $227,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999, which represents an increase of $1,276,000. This increase was attributable to higher interest income earned on a higher level of funds invested.  Interest Expense. Pro forma interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $9,598,000 as compared to $5,445,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999, which represents an increase of $4,153,000. This variance was primarily attributable to a higher level of borrowings combined with higher borrowing rates under the Refinancing than the Credit Facility.  Benefit for Income Taxes. Pro forma benefit for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $6,254,000 or 20.5% of loss before income taxes, equity income, minority interest and extraordinary loss for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus $500,000 or 6.4% of loss before income taxes for the year ended September 30, 1999. The difference between the effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2000 and the statutory tax rate resulted from non-deductible expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets, the legal settlements and foreign capital gains tax on the sale of Amcare.  Management believed that way was more likely than not that the Company would generate sufficient levels of taxable income in the future to realize the $20,961,000 of reported net deferred tax assets comprised of the tax benefit associated with future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards, prior to their expiration (primarily 12 years or more). This belief was based upon, among other factors, management's focus on its business realignment activities and business strategies primarily with respect to its U.K. Operations.                                        -27-   Minority Interest. On a pro forma basis, the Company still would have reported a benefit from minority interest of $70,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000. The minority interest represents the 1,050,000 shares of class A1 common stock of TW UK issued as part of the Nightingale consideration (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Extraordinary Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. On a pro forma basis, the Company still would have reported an extraordinary loss (net of tax benefit of $408,000) of $759,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000, as a result of the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the early extinguishment of borrowings under the Credit Facility.  Net Loss. As a result of the foregoing, on a pro forma basis, the Company still would have reported a net loss of $24,944,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000 compared to $7,346,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  GENERAL.  During the year ended September 30, 2001, the Company generated $4,172,000 from operating activities. Cash requirements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 for capital expenditures ($1,937,000), payments for acquisitions ($14,616,000), payments on revolving loan ($6,550,000) and payments on long-term debt ($4,038,000), were met through operating cash flows, net payments received from the sale of businesses ($15,075,000) and from borrowings under the U.K. subsidiaries' term loan ($72,115,000) (as discussed further in "Refinancing").  In January 2001, the Company initiated a stock repurchase program, whereby the Company may purchase up to approximately $1,000,000 of its outstanding common stock in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions. As of September 30, 2001, the Company had acquired 266,200 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $720,000which are reflected as treasury stock in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2001. The Company intends to continue with its stock repurchase program during fiscal 2002.  Cash requirements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 for capital expenditures ($1,207,000), payments for acquisitions ($13,687,000), financing fees and issuance costs ($2,849,000), payments on revolving loan ($5,121,000), payments on long-term debt ($2,187,000), as well as the $55,755,000 repayment of the Credit Facility were met through funds generated from net payments received from the U.K. subsidiaries ($67,069,000) (as discussed further in "Refinancing"), borrowings under the acquisition loan ($5,632,000) and proceeds from notes payable ($2,012,000).  During the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company generated $3,258,000 from its operating activities. Cash flow from operating activities, combined with the use of existing cash, funded a $1,500,000 payment to further reduce the Company's Credit Facility and the following investing activities: $3,824,000 for further expansion of the Company's U.K. Operations and $2,642,000 for capital expenditures.  The Company believes its existing capital resources and those generated from operating activities and available under existing borrowing arrangements will be adequate to conduct its operations for the next twelve months.                                        -28-   ASSETS LIMITED TO USE.  Represents cash and cash equivalents, advanced under the Refinancing, available for payment of up to fifty percent of the total consideration payable in connection with Permitted Acquisitions (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement).  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  The Company maintains a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 2001 and 2000, $29,555,000 (11.9%) and $23,029,000 (12.5%), respectively, of the Company's total assets consisted of accounts receivable substantially from third-party payors. Such payors generally require substantial documentation in order to process claims. The collection time for accounts receivable is typically the longest for services that relate to new patients or additional services requiring medical review for existing patients.  Accounts receivable increased by $6,526,000 from September 30, 2000 to September 30, 2001 primarily due to growth in the Company's U.K. nursing operations ($10,444,000). This increase was offset by improved collections in the Company's U.K. nursing operations and U.S. Home Healthcare business and the Company's exit of the U.S. Mail-Order Operations, including the $1,900,000 write-down of the remaining accounts receivable to their estimated net realizable value, and the sale of Amcare.  Management's goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry averages, which will tend to mitigate the risk of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable. Days sales outstanding ("DSOs") is a measure of the average number of days taken by the Company to collect its accounts receivable, calculated from the date services are rendered. As of September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company's average DSOs were 60, 51 and 73, respectively. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Staffing Enterprise as of September 27, 2001, DSOs as of September 30, 2001 were 44.  REFINANCING.  General. As described more fully below, on December 20, 1999, as amended on September 27, 2001, the Company's U.K. subsidiaries, UK Parent and its subsidiary TW UK obtained new financing denominated in pounds sterling, which aggregates approximately $195,270,000 at September 30, 2001. The new financing consists of a $140,805,000 senior collateralized term and revolving credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility"), $15,671,000 in mezzanine indebtedness (the "Mezzanine Loan") and $38,794,000 of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") (each of the foregoing are sometimes referred to collectively herein as the "Refinancing"). Of the net proceeds of the Refinancing, $55,755,000 was used to repay the Company's existing Credit Facility, $11,617,000 was provided to the Company for general corporate purposes, with the balance to be used for acquisitions and working capital in the U.K., subject to the terms of the documents governing the Refinancing. In connection with the repayment of the Company's existing Credit Facility, the Company recorded a non-cash, after-tax, extraordinary charge of approximately $759,000 in its first quarter of fiscal 2000 relating to the write-off of the deferred financing costs associated with the Credit Facility.  Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility consists of a (i) $41,283,000 term loan A, maturing December 17, 2005, (ii) $18,430,000 acquisition term loan B, maturing December 17, 2006 which may be drawn upon during the first nine years following closing, (iii) per the September 27, 2001 amendment, $73,720,000 term loan C, maturing June 30, 2007, and (iv) $7,372,000 revolving facility, maturing December 17, 2005. Repayment of the loans commenced on July 30, 2000 and continues until final maturity. The loans bear interest at rates equal                                        -29-   to LIBOR plus 2.25% to 3.50% per annum. As of December 10, 2001, TW UK had outstanding borrowings of $105,837,000 under the Senior Credit Facility. As of December 10, 2001, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of 6.32% to 7.57%.  Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Credit Facility prohibits or restricts, among other things, the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, certain fundamental corporate changes, dividends (including distributions to the Company), the making of specified investments and certain transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Senior Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as senior interest coverage, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, fixed charge coverage and minimum net worth.  The loans under the Senior Credit Facility are collateralized by, among other things, a lien on substantially all of TW UK's and its subsidiaries' assets, a pledge of TW UK's ownership interest in its subsidiaries and guaranties by TW UK's subsidiaries.  Mezzanine Loan and Mezzanine Warrants. Mezzanine Loan. The Mezzanine Loan is a term loan maturing December 17, 2007 and bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 7% per annum, where LIBOR plus 3.5% will be payable in cash, with the remaining interest being added to the principal amount of the loan. The Mezzanine Loan contains other terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in the Senior Credit Facility. The lenders of the Mezzanine Loan also received warrants to purchase 2% of the fully diluted ordinary shares of TW UK. As of December 10, 2001, borrowings under the Mezzanine Loan bore interest at a rate of 10.98%.  Mezzanine Warrants. The warrants issued to the mezzanine lenders (the "Mezzanine Warrants") are detachable and can be exercised at any time without condition for an aggregate exercise price of approximately $121,000. The fair value of the Mezzanine Warrants ($2,338,000) issued to the mezzanine lenders has been recorded as a discount to the mezzanine loan and is being amortized over the term of the loan using the interest method.  Senior Subordinated Notes and Warrants. Notes. The Notes consist of $32,860,000 principal amount of senior subordinated notes of UK Parent purchased by several institutional investors and certain members of management (collectively, the "Investors"), plus equity warrants issued by TW UK concurrently with the sale of the Notes (the "Warrants") exercisable for ordinary shares of TW UK ("Warrant Shares") representing in the aggregate 27% of the fully diluted ordinary shares of TW UK. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions - Transactions with Directors and Executive Officers."  The Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.375% per annum payable quarterly in cash subject to restrictions contained in the Senior Credit Facility requiring UK Parent to pay interest in-kind through the issuance of additional notes ("PIK Notes") for the first 18 months, with payment of interest in cash thereafter subject to a fixed charge coverage test (provided that whenever interest cannot be paid in cash, additional PIK Notes shall be issued as payment in-kind of such interest). As of September 30, 2001, $5,934,000 of PIK Notes has been recorded as additional principal due in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Notes and related PIK notes mature nine years from issuance.  UK Parent will not have the right to redeem the Notes and the PIK Notes except as provided in, and in accordance with the documents governing the issuance of the Notes and Warrants (herein the "Securities Purchase Documents"). The redemption price of the Notes and the PIK Notes will equal the principal amount of the Notes and the PIK Notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest on each.                                         -30-   The Investors have the right, at their option, to require UK Parent to redeem all or any portion of the Notes and the PIK Notes under certain circumstances and in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase Documents. The redemption price of the Notes and the PIK Notes shall be equal to the principal amount of the Notes and the PIK Notes, plus all accrued and unpaid interest on each.  UK Parent's redemption obligation of the Notes and the PIK Notes is guaranteed by TW UK, which guarantee is subordinated to the existing senior indebtedness of TW UK to the same extent as the Notes and the PIK Notes are subordinated to senior indebtedness of UK Parent. If UK Parent fails to perform in full its obligations following exercise of the Investors put of Notes and TW UK fails to perform its obligations as a guarantor of such obligations, the Investors shall have the right to among other things exercise directly (through the voting trust described below) the drag-along rights described without the requirement that the Board of Directors of TW UK first take any action.  Warrants. The Warrants may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time, unless previously purchased or cancelled upon a redemption of the Notes, at the option of the holders prior to the time of maturity of the Notes for Warrant Shares representing approximately 27% of TW UK's fully diluted ordinary share capital, subject to antidilution adjustment as contained in the Securities Purchase Documents.  The exercise price of the Warrants shall equal the entire principal amount of the Notes (other than PIK Notes and excluding any accrued unpaid interest) for all Warrants in the aggregate and can be exercised for cash or through the tender of Notes (other than PIK Notes) to TW UK, whereby TW UK shall issue to the Investors the appropriate number of Warrant Shares and pay to the Investors in cash an amount equal to the principal amount of the PIK Notes and all accrued unpaid interest on the Notes and the PIK Notes. In the event that any warrants are exercised by tendering cash, the UK Parent shall have the right, at its option (which it intends to exercise), to redeem the aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the number of warrants so exercised multiplied by the warrant exercise price.  The Warrants will automatically be exercised for Warrant Shares in the event that TW UK consummates a public offering of shares valuing the Investors' ordinary shares of TW UK issuable upon a voluntary exercise of the Warrants at or above 2.5x the initial investment.  The Investors will have the right, at their option, to require UK Parent to purchase all or any portion of the Warrants or the Warrant Shares under certain circumstances and in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase Documents. The purchase price of the Warrants shall be equal to the difference, if a positive number, between (i) the fair market value of the Warrant Shares which the Investors have the right to acquire upon exercise of such Warrants and (ii) the exercise price of such Warrants. The purchase price of the Warrant Shares shall be equal to the fair market value of such Warrant Shares.

The transactions include provisions to pay additional amounts, payable in cash, of up to $13,000,000 in contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entities.  U.S. MAIL-ORDER OPERATIONS SALE.  In September 2000, the Company approved a plan to exit its U.S. Mail-Order Operations and on September 18, 2000, entered into an agreement, which was completed on October 3, 2000, to sell certain assets of this division located in Jacksonville, Florida. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company received $2,000,000 plus $556,000 representing the book value of saleable on-hand inventory at September 29, 2000. During the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recognized a pre-tax charge for impairment of long-lived assets of $12,346,000, principally reflecting the write-down of intangible assets to their fair value. Based upon additional information and revised cost benefit estimates by management, the Company recorded a charge of $1,900,000 to reflect the write-down of the remaining accounts receivable to their estimated net realizable value for the first quarter of fiscal 2001.  The Company recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 representing the estimated costs related to exiting the business and closing its U.S. Mail-Order Operations. The restructuring charge included $128 for the write-off of unrecoverable leasehold improvements, $680,000 to satisfy existing lease obligations and $480,000 for severance and employee related costs.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a charge for impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $2,727,000 to reflect the write-down of the carrying value of goodwill, originally acquired with the purchase of Amcare, to its fair value as well as a tax charge of approximately $1,654,000 to reflect the tax effect of the transaction.  Due to the sale of Amcare, the Company recorded losses of $354,000 and realized a foreign exchange loss of $391,000 in the first quarter ended December 31, 2000 as a result of the completion of the transaction.                                        -33-  CONTINGENCIES.  Some of the Company's subsidiaries are Medicare Part B suppliers who submit claims to the designated carrier who is the government's claims processing administrator. From time to time, the carrier may request an audit of Medicare Part B claims on a prepayment or postpayment basis. Some of the Company's subsidiaries currently have pending such audits. If the outcome of any audit results in a denial or a finding of an overpayment, then the affected subsidiary has appeal rights. Some of the subsidiaries currently are responding to these audits and pursuing appeal rights in certain circumstances.  LITIGATION.  See "Legal Proceedings" with respect to certain legal proceedings concerning the Company and HMI.  IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS 141, "Business Combinations", and FAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". The provisions of FAS 141 are effective for any business combinations accounted for by the purchase method and are completed after June 30, 2001. The provisions of FAS 142 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. FAS 141 changes the accounting for business combinations by, among other things, prohibiting the prospective use of pooling-of-interests accounting. Under FAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests. In accordance with the transitional provisions of FAS 142, the Company has not amortized goodwill acquired in business combinations subsequent to June 30, 2001. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company is currently reviewing the impact of FAS 142 and will be performing a fair-value analysis at a later date.  INFLATION  Inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company's operations to date.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE  The Company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company's primary exposure relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in the U.K. where the principal currency is Pounds Sterling. Currently, the Company does not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposures.                                          -34-   INTEREST RATE RISK  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the Company's cash equivalents and the U.K. subsidiaries' December 20, 1999 Refinancing which includes the Senior Credit Facility and Mezzanine Loan. The Company's cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments purchased with initial maturities of 90 days or less. The Company is subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact its consolidated results of operations or cash flows for its variable rate Senior Credit Facility, Mezzanine Loan and cash equivalents. In accordance with provisions of the Refinancing, on January 25, 2000, the Company hedged the interest rate (LIBOR cap of 9%) on approximately $41,935,000 of its floating rate debt in a contract which expires June 30, 2003. The approximate notional amount of the contract adjusts down (consistent with debt maturity) as follows:        December 31, 2001              $35,331,000       June 30, 2002                  $32,855,000       December 31, 2002              $30,378,000  As of September 30, 2001, the Company's Notes ($32,860,000) and PIK Notes ($5,933,000) mature on December 31, 2008 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 9.375%. In addition, the Company had notes payable of $19,323,000, net of $1,141,000 debt discount, which were issued in connection with the acquisition of several U.K. flexible staffing agencies. The notes payable are redeemable, at the holder's option, in fiscal 2003 and bear interest ranging from 4.0% to 5.5% at September 30, 2001. The table below represents the expected maturity of the Company's variable rate debt and their weighted average interest rates at September 30, 2001.
