Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     General          The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in conjunction with the description of our business included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position. This discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainty. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Forward-Looking Statements.   - 28 -              We are a leading provider of flexible, or temporary, healthcare staffing to the healthcare industry in the United Kingdom, as measured by revenues, market share and number of staff. Our flexible healthcare staffing service provides personal or basic care and nursing services in the home, nursing and care homes and hospitals. The services provided by us are provided by our integrated network of approximately 100 branches, which are located throughout most of the U.K. Our healthcare staff consists principally of homecare aides (known as carers in the U.K.), nurses and nurses aides. We maintain an active listing of over 11,000 homecare aides, nurses and nurses aides. We generally place about 7,100 individuals each week with our customers. Our management evaluates operating results on a branch basis. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131,  Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information , for financial reporting purposes, all our branches are aggregated into one reportable segment.        The NHS requires any healthcare staffing company that provides temporary staff to the NHS hospitals in a region to enter into a Framework Agreement setting forth, among other things, applicable quality standards and maximum payment rates. The NHS Framework Agreements have impacted our financial results by reducing our margins from this source of business. In addition, we have experienced reduced revenues from the NHS as a result of the efforts of the NHS to source more of its work from its own employee base and its in-house agency (NHS Professionals). The reduction in demand from the NHS for healthcare staffing services as a result of overspending by the NHS Trusts (the NHS operates its hospitals through NHS Trusts, each of which operates one or more hospitals) has also impacted our financial results.        We are aware of recent legislative changes, which are currently scheduled to go into effect in April 2009, that will result in the withdrawal of the Concession that we currently enjoy from VAT. See Item 1BusinessGovernment RegulationHealthcare ReformChanges in U.K. value-added tax (VAT) rules. As discussed in that section, as a result of the withdrawal of the Concession, some of the staffing services that we provide will become exempt, as a result of which our overall costs may increase. As further discussed in that section, some of our staffing services will become standard-rated, as a result of which the costs of our customers may increase, thereby potentially reducing our competitiveness, revenues and/or profit margins. A further legislative change, scheduled to go into effect in April 2009, will increase the number of holiday pay entitlement for our flexible healthcare staff from 24 to 28 days per annum. We are currently evaluating the likely impact of these changes on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.   Critical Accounting Policies          The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures in a given reporting period. We believe the following accounting policies are critical areas affecting our financial condition and results of operations where estimates are required.   - 29 -         Accounts Receivable          We are required to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivables, which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current credit-worthiness of each customer. Significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future as we continue to expand our business and as conditions in the marketplace change.        Our company maintains credit controls to ensure cash collection on a timely basis. The credit terms agreed with our customers range from 7 days to a maximum of 30 days from invoice date. We maintain a credit department which consists of approximately 20 personnel who are targeted to collect outstanding receivables. We have established the following guidelines for the credit department to use as well as for us to assess the credit departments performance:                       to maintain average days sales outstanding (including unbilled accounts receivable) to below 45 days;                           to limit our overdues (greater than 90 days) within agreed targets; and                           to limit bad debt write off in the year within agreed targets.            We also apply a policy of withdrawing supply from customers who are significantly overdue. Many private customers are contracted on a direct debit basis where we can collect payment direct from customers bank accounts.        We have devised a provisioning methodology based on the customer profile and historical credit risk across our U.K. business. Accounts receivable are written off when the credit control department determines the amount is no longer collectible. In addition, we do not have a threshold for account balance write-offs as our policy focuses on all balances, whatever the size.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets          We have significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in strategy and/or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill. We have recorded goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions through September 30, 2008. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A more frequent evaluation will be performed if indicators of impairment are present. We completed the annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill balance. The calculation of fair value used for an impairment test includes a number of estimates and assumptions, including future income and cash flow projections, the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate. If we are required to record an impairment charge in the future, it could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   - 30 -         Income Taxes          We account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes  (FAS No. 109) and FASB Interpretation No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesAn Interpretation of FASB 109  (FIN 48). The Company adopted FIN 48 on October 1, 2007.        Under FAS No. 109, deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect tax carryforwards and the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes, as determined under currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recorded if future realization is more likely than not. Deferred taxes are recorded primarily for bad debts, federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, depreciation and amortization of intangibles, which are reported in different periods for federal income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The determination of whether or not valuation allowances are required to be recorded involves significant estimates regarding the future profitability of our company, as well as potential tax strategies for the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.        FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires the Company to recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of September 30, 2008, the Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits.   Contingencies          We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.   Revenue Recognition          Patient services are recognized when services are performed and substantiated by proper documentation. For patient services, which are billed at fixed rates, revenue is mainly recognized upon the completion of timesheets that also require the signature of the recipient of our services and through electronic call monitoring.        We receive a majority of our revenue from local governmental social services departments and the NHS. For the years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, 69.0%,   - 31 -           63.5% and 68.3%, respectively, of our net revenues were attributable to local governmental social service departments and the NHS payor program.   Purchase Accounting          We account for our acquisitions as purchase business combinations. At acquisition, preliminary values and useful lives are allocated based upon fair values that have been determined for assets acquired and liabilities assumed and managements best estimates for values that have not yet been finalized. We obtain a third-party valuation in order to complete our purchase price allocations. Accordingly, final asset and liability fair values as well as useful lives may differ from managements original estimates and could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding our companys results of operations, as these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The chart also provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures.   Revenues          Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2008, before the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, increased $20.2 million, or 7.3% to $298.0 million compared to $277.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2007. Contributing to the increase in revenue was homecare staffing, which grew by 12.7% to $225.0 million. Nursing home staffing achieved 3.5% growth in revenue totaling $41.8 million. Due to the NHS Framework Agreements, NHS Professionals and NHS overspending discussed above, hospital staffing revenues declined 17.5% to $31.2 million. Changes in foreign exchange increased the reported result by $0.6 million to $298.6 million compared to $277.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2007, an increase of $20.8 million or 7.5%.   - 32 -         Gross Profit          Gross profit, before the favorable impact of foreign exchange, increased 7.4% to $90.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2008 from $84.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2007. Changes in foreign exchange increased gross profit by $0.2 million to $90.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2008 compared to $84.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2007, an increase of 7.7%. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2008 was 30.3%, as compared to 30.2% for the comparable prior period. Gross profit margin for the year ended September 30, 2008 improved slightly due to the change in the mix of the business as a result of the overall growth in our homecare staffing which typically operates at higher margins. We remain focused on supplying healthcare staff to our higher-margin homecare customers.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses          Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.4 million to $77.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2008 from $75.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2007, an increase of 3.1%. Changes in foreign exchange of $0.1 million had an unfavorable effect on SG&A costs. The remaining increase in SG&A costs is mainly due to additional branch costs of $5.0 million associated with the growth of our companys business, and increased training and quality costs of $1.4 million from our investment in recruitment and retention of our care workers. These increased costs were partially offset by decreased IT costs of $1.4 million from infrastructure efficiencies in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 and expenses incurred in the year ended September 30, 2007 related to severance costs and related professional fees of $1.2 million incurred upon the resignation of the chairman and chief executive officer, issuance of new warrants and modification to extend the expiration date on warrants previously issued of $0.4 million and chief executive officer search fees and consultancy costs associated with compliance under our senior credit facility of $0.7 million.   Interest Income          Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2008 was $0.9 million compared to $0.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2007. The increase in interest income was mainly attributable to additional cash on hand as a result of the sale of the respiratory therapy division in fiscal 2007.   Interest Expense           Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2008 was $0.5 million compared to $4.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2007, which represents a decrease of $3.7 million. This decrease was principally due to the prepayment and pay-off of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility and was partially offset by costs related to the suspension of the availability of our invoice discount facility, which we do not currently anticipate reinstating. As such, we have recognized interest costs of $0.4 million for bank fees.   - 33 -         Provision for Income Taxes          We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $3.8 million or 29.9% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2008, compared to a provision of $2.1 million or 36.4% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2007. The difference in the effective tax rate between the year ended September 30, 2008 and the year ended September 30, 2007 is mainly due to the utilization of loss carry forwards and permanent differences.   Discontinued Operations          Discontinued operations resulted in income of $62.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2007. On September 30, 2007, we disposed of two of our U.K. subsidiaries when we sold all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Allied Respiratory Limited and Medigas Limited for £36.5 million ($74.7 million) in cash, of which £0.5 million ($1.0 million) was held back until certain conditions are met. Of the escrowed amount, £0.4 million ($0.9 million) was released to us in fiscal 2008 and the remaining £0.1 million ($0.2 million) was released to us in fiscal 2009. These two subsidiaries constituted our respiratory therapy division, which supplied medical-grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to pharmacies in the U.K., oxygen concentrators to customers in Northern Ireland and oxygen services to customers in the South East of England. Included in the $62.7 million in income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2007 is the gain of $56.5 million, net of tax of $0, on the sale of our respiratory therapy division. Under U.K. tax legislation, enacted on April 1, 2002, disposals of shares by companies with substantial shareholdings does not result in a taxable gain transaction.        In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  (FAS No. 144), we have accounted for our respiratory therapy division as a discontinued operation. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our respiratory therapy division for the prior period are reported in discontinued operations on our statement of operations.        The following table presents the financial results for the discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 (dollars in thousands).                                             Year Ended                     September 30,                     2007              Revenues:                          Net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies         $    28,699                                      Cost of revenues:                          Respiratory, medical equipment and supplies              13,024                                                            Gross profit              15,675                                      Selling, general and administrative expenses              6,091                                  - 34 -                                                     Year Ended                     September 30,                     2007              Operating income from discontinued operations              9,584                                      Interest income              2           Interest expense              (1,570    )(a)                                                       Income from discontinued operations before income tax              8,016              Gain on disposal of subsidiaries, net of tax              56,471    (b)                                                       Provision for income taxes              1,750    (c)                                                       Income from discontinued operations         $    62,737                                        (a)     In fiscal 2007, interest expense has been allocated to discontinued operations based on debt that we have specifically identified as being attributable to discontinued operations, as an allocation based on net assets would not provide a meaningful result. We based our allocation on the amount of capital expenditures directly related to our discontinued operations and then considered cash borrowings necessary to maintain the operations of our then respiratory therapy division.    (b)    Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52,  Foreign Currency Translation  (FAS No. 52), translation adjustments that result when a foreign entitys financial statements are translated into a parent companys or an investors reporting currency are separately reported in the parent companys other comprehensive income. Foreign currency translation adjustments that are accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to income only when they are realized, if the investment in the foreign entity is sold or is substantially or completed liquidated. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation adjustments of the balance sheet related to the respiratory therapy segment in the amount of approximately $1.6 million were reclassified into the gain on disposal of subsidiaries.      (c)     Included in the provision for income taxes for the year end September 30, 2007 is the reversal of $0.7 million of certain tax contingencies related to our fiscal 2003 discontinued operations on the sale of two of our U.S. subsidiaries as the statute of limitations has expired.   Net Income          As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of $8.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2008 compared to net income of $66.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2007.   Year Ended September 30, 2007 vs. Year Ended September 30, 2006     Revenues          Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2007 were $277.8 million compared to $280.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2006, a decrease of $2.4 million or 0.9%. This decrease was mainly due to a reduction in demand from the NHS as overspending by the NHS   - 35 -           Trusts in other areas has forced significant reductions in agency spending as well as price pressures arising from the NHS Framework Agreements. Changes in foreign exchange had a favorable effect on revenue ($23.7 million).   Gross Profit          Total gross profit decreased by $1.7 million to $84.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 from $85.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2006, a decrease of 2.1%. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2007 slightly decreased to 30.2% from 30.6% for the comparable prior period mainly due to lower margins on the NHS Framework Agreements. Changes in foreign exchange had a favorable effect on gross profit ($7.2 million).   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses          Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.2 million to $75.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 from $71.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2006, an increase of 5.9%. This increase was mainly due to severance costs and related professional fees incurred upon the resignation of our chairman and chief executive officer ($1.2 million) and the issuance of new warrants and modification to extend the expiration date on warrants previously issued ($0.4 million). The increase was partially offset by lower overhead costs ($3.4 million). Changes in foreign exchange had an unfavorable effect on selling, general and administrative costs ($6.1 million).   Interest Income          Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2007 was $0.1 million compared to $0.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2006.   Interest Expense           Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2007 was $4.2 million compared to $2.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2006, which represents an increase of $1.3 million. This increase was principally attributable to the write-off of deferred financing fees ($0.7 million) and prepayment fees ($0.3 million) associated with the irrevocable written notice given to our lenders notifying them of our intent to prepay the outstanding amounts under our term loan A and term loan B1 from the proceeds from the sale of our respiratory therapy division, as well as changes in foreign exchange of $0.6 million. This increase was partially offset by lower borrowings in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.   Other Income          Total other income for the year ended September 30, 2007 was $0.8 million, which represents the change in value of our interest rate swaps that had been designated as cash flow hedges and which were deemed to be ineffective at September 30, 2007.    - 36 -           Provision for Income Taxes          We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $2.1 million or 36.4% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2007, compared to a benefit of $1.9 million or 1.7% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2006. The difference in the effective tax rate between the year ended September 30, 2007 and the year ended September 30, 2006 is mainly due to non-deductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2006, permanent differences in the United Kingdom and change in the U.K. enacted rates.   Discontinued Operations          Discontinued operations resulted in income of $62.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 compared to a loss of $17.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. Included in the $62.7 million from discontinued operations in fiscal 2007 is the gain of $56.5 million, net of tax of $0, on the sale of our respiratory therapy division. Under U.K. tax legislation, enacted on April 1, 2002, disposals of shares by companies with substantial shareholdings does not result in a taxable gain transaction.        In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 144, we have accounted for our respiratory therapy division as a discontinued operation. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our respiratory therapy division for the current and prior periods are reported in discontinued operations in our statement of operations.        The following table presents the financial results for the discontinued operations (dollars in thousands).                                                                 Year Ended September 30,                     2007              2006              Revenues:                                              Net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies         $    28,699              $    14,402                                                          Cost of revenues:                                              Respiratory, medical equipment and supplies              13,024                   10,521           Impairment of respiratory, medical equipment and supplies                                 5,932    (d)                                           Total cost of revenues              13,024                   16,453                                                                                               Gross profit (loss)              15,675                   (2,051    )                                                     Selling, general and administrative expenses              6,091                   4,449           Impairment of goodwill                                 11,897    (e)      Impairment of long-lived assets                                 257    (d)                                                                                          Operating income (loss) from discontinued operations              9,584                   (18,654    )                                                     Interest income              2                   2           Interest expense              (1,570    )(a)              (1,410    )(a)                                             - 37 -                                                                          Year Ended September 30,                     2007              2006              Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income tax              8,016                   (20,062    )         Gain on disposal of subsidiaries, net of tax              56,471    (b)                                                                                                             Provision for (benefit from) income taxes              1,750    (c)              (2,444    )                                                                                          Income (loss) from discontinued operations         $    62,737              $    (17,618    )                                                                    (a)         In fiscal 2007 and 2006, interest expense has been allocated to discontinued operations based on debt that we have specifically identified as being attributable to discontinued operations, as an allocation based on net assets would not provide a meaningful result. We based our allocation on the amount of capital expenditures directly related to our discontinued operations and then considered cash borrowings necessary to maintain the operations of our then respiratory therapy division. Prior to fiscal 2006, the respiratory therapy division was self-sufficient and borrowings were predominately used to fund acquisitions in our flexible healthcare staffing division.           (b)         Under the provisions of FAS No. 52, translation adjustments that result when a foreign entitys financial statements are translated into a parent companys or an investors reporting currency are separately reported in the parent companys other comprehensive income. Foreign currency translation adjustments that are accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to income only when they are realized, if the investment in the foreign entity is sold or is substantially or completed liquidated. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation adjustments of the balance sheet related to the respiratory therapy segment in the amount of approximately $1.6 million were reclassified into the gain on disposal of subsidiaries.           (c)         Included in the provision for income taxes for the year end September 30, 2007 is the reversal of $0.7 million of certain tax contingencies related to our fiscal 2003 discontinued operations on the sale of two of our U.S. subsidiaries as the statute of limitations has expired.           (d)         In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we recognized pre-tax charges of $5.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the write-off of revenue producing equipment (oxygen cylinders), oxygen filling station and software costs, respectively. Due to the award of the new oxygen contracts (see below), we had made significant capital expenditures, amounting to $14.7 million, in order to fulfill our obligation under the new contracts. We had substituted a number of cylinders with oxygen concentrators. As such, we believed that these oxygen cylinders had become obsolete and had no further use to us. We also invested in an oxygen filling station whereby our cylinders would be re-filled. Due to the location of the plant and strict noise pollution governmental rules, we did not believe we would be able to utilize such plant. We also wrote-off various software costs related to transitioning to our new oxygen contracts that we believed had no future benefit.           (e)         During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed our annual impairment test required under FAS No. 142 and determined there was an impairment to our recorded goodwill balance by using a combination of market multiple, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow methods. Based on a combination of factors, contributing to the impairment loss were the decrease in profits in our respiratory therapy division due to the transitioning from the old pharmacy        - 38 -                                      based contracts to the new supply of oxygen direct to patients contracts that have lower margins (see below), our market capitalization at time of review as well as the current and projected operating results. As such, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $11.9 million.             In 2005, the U.K. Department of Health sought to unify the supply of oxygen to NHS patients in England and Wales. The previous system used pharmacies to supply cylindered gases, while oxygen concentrators were supplied via regional contracts with homecare providers. Under the revised system, which came into effect on February 1, 2006, homecare providers supply cylindered gas and liquid oxygen as well as oxygen concentrators directly to patients. Following a bidding process, we were awarded two of the contracts with the U.K. Department of Health, both of which commenced in February 2006 and both of which covered the South East of England. The contracts required the set up of additional facilities in the South East of England, which we effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and which resulted in our company incurring additional charges and capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 as we commenced supplying under the new contracts. Our supply of cylindered gases in Northern Ireland and Scotland was unaffected by the new contracts, as was our contract to supply oxygen concentrator services in Northern Ireland.   Net Income          As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of $66.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 compared to a net loss of $123.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2006.   Liquidity and Capital Resources     General          For our fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, we generated $8.9 million from continuing operating activities. Cash requirements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 for the pay off and pay down of debt under our senior credit facility ($52.8 million) and capital expenditures ($3.3 million) were met through the proceeds received from the sale of our respiratory therapy division in fiscal 2007 ($53.6 million), sale of our interest rate swaps ($0.6 million) and cash on hand.        We believe that the existing capital resources and those to be generated from operating activities will be adequate to conduct our operations for the next 12 months.   Accounts Receivable          We maintain a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, $17.8 million (9.7%) and $21.5 million (8.5%) and ,  respectively, of our total assets consisted of accounts receivable. The decrease in accounts receivable from 2007 to 2008 is mainly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as well as the timing between billed and unbilled accounts receivable.    - 39 -                Our goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry average, which would tend to mitigate the risk of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. We maintain credit controls to ensure cash collection on a timely basis. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) is a measure of the average number of days we take to collect our accounts receivable, calculated from the date services are rendered. At September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, our average DSOs were 21 and 26, respectively. This is the lowest level achieved by our company, and was impacted by the timing of invoicing and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We anticipate that our DSO will return to its historical rate of 25-27 days per month in upcoming periods.        At September 30, 2008 gross receivables were $21.5 million, of which $15.2 million or 70.7% were represented by amounts due from U.K. governmental bodies, either the NHS or local governmental social service departments (the SSD). At September 30, 2007 gross receivables were $26.7 million, of which $18.5 million or 69.4% were represented by amounts due from U.K. governmental bodies. The remaining accounts receivable balance is due from commercial payors (nursing homes, private hospitals and pharmacies) and private payors.        The following table summarizes the accounts

The surcharges are recognized in income only upon receipt of payment.         - 40 -                Each fiscal year we undertake a review of our methodology and procedure for reserving for our doubtful accounts. This process also takes into account our actual experience of write offs in the period. The policy is then applied at each quarter end to arrive at a closing reserve for doubtful accounts. See Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounts Receivable, for a description of our methodology procedure.        Given the high percentage of U.K. governmental debt, the large number of customer accounts with low-value debt within the remainder of the accounts receivable ledger and the methodology for making provisions for doubtful accounts, we believe our provisioning method is prudent and appropriate to our business.        We provide homecare aides and nurses on the basis of terms (payment due within 7 to 30 days of invoice) and prices (rate per hour or fraction of an hour) agreed to in advance with our customers. The work is either logged by electronic call monitoring or time sheets are signed by clients for the work performed and then invoices are generated based on agreed billing rates. Consequently, there is no process for approval of invoices. Our credit control policies currently achieve an average collection of approximately 25 days from submission of invoices.        As our current operations are in the United Kingdom and the majority of accounts receivable are from U.K. governmental bodies for which payment terms and prices are agreed in advance, we have not recorded any contractual allowances.   Borrowings     General          In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, our first tier U.K. subsidiary, Allied Healthcare Group Holdings Limited (Allied Holdings), obtained a senior credit facility, which was amended in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 to provide for additional facilities.        The senior credit facility consisted of the following:                       an £18 ($36.9) million term loan A that would have matured in July 2009;                           a £12.5 ($25.6) million revolving loan B1 that would have matured in July 2009 and that could have been drawn upon until June 2009;                           a £7.5 ($15.3) million invoice discounting facility B2 that matures in July 2009 and that can be drawn upon until June 2009, and                           an £8.0 ($16.4) million revolving loan C that would have matured in July 2009 and that could have been upon until June 2009.            On October 1, 2007 Allied Holdings prepaid the amounts outstanding under the term loan A and the term loan B1 facilities from the proceeds of sale of our respiratory therapy division. Allied Holdings also cancelled term loan A, term loan B1 and revolving loan C on October 1, 2007. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we agreed with the banks to suspend the availability    - 41 -            of our invoice discount facility and to have the right to reinstate availability upon six weeks notice. As of September 30, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under the invoice discounting loan B2 and currently do not anticipate reinstating the invoice discount facility. As such, we have recognized interest costs of $0.4 million for bank fees.        The invoice discount facility provides, among other things, the following:                       we can borrow on 85% of our approved flexible staffing accounts receivable, which excludes accounts receivable greater than 120 days, credit balances and reserves;                           no one debtor can exceed 10% of the outstanding approved accounts receivable; and                           accounts receivable relating to private individuals are not fundable.            The senior credit facility agreement was based on the U.K.s Loan Markets Association Multicurrency Term and Revolving Facilities agreement, which is a standard form designed to be commercially acceptable to the corporate lending market.        Subject to certain exceptions, the senior credit facility prohibited or restricted the following, among other things:                       incurring liens and granting security interests in our assets or the assets of certain of our U.K. subsidiaries;                           incurring additional indebtedness;                           making certain fundamental corporate changes;                           paying dividends (including the payment of dividends to our company by our subsidiaries);                           making specified investments, acquisitions or disposals;                           repurchasing shares; and                           entering into certain transactions with affiliates.       Guarantees          The senior credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on the assets of Allied Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries. Together with Allied Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries, our company is guaranteeing the debt and other obligations of certain wholly-owned U.K. subsidiaries under the senior credit facility. At September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, the amounts guaranteed, which approximated the amounts outstanding, totaled $0.0 million and $54.8 million, respectively. In conjunction with the amendment to the senior credit facility, we    - 42 -              granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the payment of our guarantee.

Certain of these leases provide for renewal options.   Contractual Cash Obligations          As described under Borrowings and CommitmentsOperating Leases above, the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                                                                                     Total Lease         Total Other         Total      Fiscal         Obligations         Obligations         Obligations         2009         $    2,609              $    1,252              $    3,861           2010              1,909                   749                   2,658           2011              1,125                   931                   2,056           2012              666                   820                   1,486           2013              266                   236                   502           Thereafter              31                                      31                                      $    6,606              $    3,988              $    10,594                                   Lease obligations reflect future minimum rental commitments required under operating lease agreements as of September 30, 2008. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options. Other obligations represent our contractual commitment for a new branch operating system. We anticipate incurring total expenditures, both contractual and non-contractual, relating to software, hardware, hosting services and training costs of approximately $7.2 million (at current exchange rates), of which $1.3 million was incurred in fiscal 2008 and $5.9 million is expected to be incurred from fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2011. We anticipate that funding will come from our existing cash and cash provided by operating activities.    - 43 -          Miscellaneous     Treasury Shares          In January 2001, we initiated a stock repurchase program, whereby we may purchase up to approximately $1.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. In May 2003, we initiated a second stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may purchase up to an additional $3.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. As of September 30, 2008, we had acquired 407,700 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.3 million pursuant to our stock repurchase programs, which are reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2008. In addition, as of September 30, 2008, we had acquired 177,055 shares of our companys common stock for an aggregate value of $1.0 million from certain of our executive officers. Such shares were acquired in fiscal 2004 and delivered to us as payment on promissory notes issued by us to them.   Acquisitions          In fiscal 2006, we acquired the entire issued share capital of a home care training agency for approximately $0.8 million in cash and additional contingent cash consideration of up to $0.9 million dependent upon (i) future earnings in fiscal 2006, (ii) providing a set minimum of training programs and (iii) the sellers continuing employment with our company until at least December 31, 2006. Of the $0.9 million contingent cash consideration, we have recognized compensation costs of $0.1 million, net of income tax, and $0.5 million, net of income tax, for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively, as the acquisition contract required the sellers to remain in employment with us until at least December 31, 2006 (the earnout period). In fiscal 2007, the contingent consideration was earned and paid.        The pro forma results of operations and related per share information for this acquisition has not been presented as the amounts are considered immaterial.   Disposition          On September 30, 2007, we sold all of the shares of Allied Respiratory Limited to Air Liquide Limited. Allied Respiratory Limited and its subsidiary, Medigas Limited, constituted the respiratory therapy division of our company. The consideration for the sale was denominated in sterling and consisted of £36.5 million ($74.7 million), of which £0.5 million ($1.0 million) was held back until certain conditions are met. Of the escrowed amount, £0.4 million ($0.9 million) was released to us in fiscal 2008 and the remaining £0.1 million ($0.2 million) was released to us in fiscal 2009.        In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 144, we have accounted for our respiratory therapy division as a discontinued operation. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our respiratory therapy division for prior periods are reported in discontinued operations in our statement of operations.    - 44 -               See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 for a discussion and details of discontinued operations, including an analysis of the pro forma effects on our financial statements of the discontinued operations.   Litigation          See Item 3Legal Proceedings.   Contingencies          We believe that we have been in compliance, in all material respects, with the applicable provisions related to our business operations of federal laws and regulations and applicable state laws, together with the applicable laws and regulations of other countries in which we operate. There can be no assurance that an enforcement action will not be brought against us, or that we will not be found to be in violation of one or more of these laws or regulations. At present, we cannot anticipate what impact, if any, administrative or judicial interpretations of applicable federal and state laws and the laws of other countries in which we operate may have on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.        We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities. We are vigorously defending our position in all such proceedings. We believe that these matters should not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.        Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated. Based on managements best estimate of probable liability, we have accrued $0.3 million and $0.2 million for such costs at September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively.   Impact of Recent Accounting Standards          See Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2008.      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.     Foreign Currency Exchange          We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results. Currently, we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposures.        The translation of the operating results of our U.K. operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the fiscal 2008 year as compared to the fiscal 2007 average rate, the translation of our U.K. financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in increased revenues of $0.6 million, increased operating income of $30 thousand and increased    - 45 -            income from continuing operations of $15 thousand. We estimate that a 10% change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar would have a $29.9 million, $1.5 million and $0.8 million impact on reported revenues, operating income and income from continuing operations, respectively.   Interest Rate Risk          Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments purchased with initial maturities of 90 days or less.        At September 30, 2008, we had no debt outstanding. Historically, we used interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes related to our senior credit facility.      Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
