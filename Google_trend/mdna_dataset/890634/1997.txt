ITEM 7.           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION                    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.           GENERAL                    The Company is a regional provider of a broad range of alternate site health care services and products. The Company provides the following services and products to patients in their homes or in an outpatient setting: (i) respiratory therapy, home medical equipment and specialized mail-order pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, including respiratory and diabetic medications and supplies, wound care dressings and ostomy and orthotic products; (ii) patient services, including nursing and para-professional services and radiation therapy; and (iii) infusion therapy. During fiscal 1996, the Company derived 61.8% of its revenues from respiratory therapy, home medical equipment and specialized mail-order sales, 25.1% from patient services and 13.1% from infusion therapy.                    The Company's growth strategy is to capitalize on consolidation in the alternate site health care industry by aggressively pursuing acquisitions of alternate site health care companies in selected services, products and markets where the Company believes it has the opportunity to create a comprehensive delivery network. Once it enters a new market, the Company's strategy is to use its acquired operations as a platform to: (i) offer comprehensive services and products by cross-marketing its various businesses; (ii) compete aggressively by traditional referral sources and entering into managed care contracts as a preferred provider; and (iii) leverage its sales and marketing efforts, maximize referral networks and achieve operational efficiencies. The Company further seeks to develop market concentrations in each of its services in order to achieve levels of coverage which make the services attractive to a variety of payors and patients.                    Since its merger with TNI in June 1992, the Company has completed the following ten acquisitions of alternate site health care providers.

On January 14, 1997, the Company acquired 8,964,292 newly issued HMI common shares representing approximately 49% of HMI's outstanding common stock for a purchase price of $8,964,292. The Company has also entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire the balance of HMI not already owned by the Company and stock purchase agreements to acquire the VIP Companies. See "-- Liquidity and Capital Resources." The Company believes that a substantial number of acquisition opportunities may continue to arise as managed care and other competitive pressures encourage further industry consolidation.                    The Company's revenue mix and payor mix will be influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles. The following table shows the percentage of net revenues represented by each of the Company's product lines:                                                                Year Ended October 31,                                                           --------------------------------                                                         1996         1995          1994                                                        ------       ------       ------        Net patient services............................         25.1%        26.3%        30.5% Net infusion services...........................         13.1         13.9         26.6 Net respiratory, medical   equipment and supplies sales..................         61.8         59.8         42.9                                                        ------       ------       ------          Total revenues.........................        100.0%       100.0%       100.0%                                                        ======       ======       ======                      The increase in net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales (and corresponding decline in net patient services and net infusion services as a percentage of total revenues) from the year ended October 31, 1994 to October 31, 1995 resulted primarily from the acquisition of DermaQuest (effective November 1, 1994) and inclusion of Respiflow and MK (effective April 1, 1994) for an entire fiscal year, which collectively contributed approximately $38,447,000 or 53.7% of total revenues for                                         -27-    31 fiscal 1995. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues. Assuming the Company owned 100% of HMI on November 1, 1995, HMI would have accounted for approximately 67.9% of the combined pro forma revenue ($237,858,000) for the year ended October 31, 1996.                    The following table shows the payor mix for the Company's net revenues for the periods presented.

The Company believes that its payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, from shifts in existing business among payors. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Company owned 100% of HMI on November 1, 1995, the payor mix for the year ended October 31, 1996 (including HMI) would have been as follows: Medicare 22.2%; Medicaid 27.5%; and private payors 50.3%.                    The Company's revenues and profitability are affected by the on-going efforts of third-party payors to contain health care costs by lowering reimbursement rates, increasing case management review and negotiating reduced contract pricing. In addition, certain private payors, such as managed care providers, are able to negotiate lower rates than those paid by other payors. The Company believes that a substantial portion of its revenues derived from private payors in fiscal 1996 was subject to case management and managed care and that this relationship will continue in the future. The Company maintains a diversified offering of alternate site services and products in an attempt to insulate the Company against potential reimbursement reductions for specific products or services. Additionally, the Company is continuously exploring alternatives to lower its operating costs, such as negotiating more favorable supply contracts and identifying operating efficiencies at the branch level.                    After years of consideration, a specific policy relating to the coverage of respiratory medications has finally been released by Medicare. This policy appears to reduce somewhat the number of patients qualifying for Medicare coverage, sets specific reimbursement rates for compounded, generic and branded respiratory medications, and requires, effective December 1, 1996, that only licensed pharmacies may bill Medicare for Part B Medicare reimbursed medications, including, but not limited to, respiratory medications. While the implementation of this policy should reduce the overall number   - -------- *        Includes managed care payors.                                         -28-    32 of competitors in the respiratory medications market place over the next year or so, the Company cannot predict at this time the extent of the positive or negative effect that this policy may have on the number of patients serviced, Respiflow's pharmacy based operations or the marketing opportunities created thereby.                    The Company's gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of its product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates. The Company historically has recognized higher gross margins from its specialized mail-order and medical supplies pharmacy, respiratory therapy and radiation therapy operations than from its nursing and infusion therapy operations.  Upon the consummation of the pending acquisition of HMI, the Company believes that it will derive a greater   percentage of its revenues from chronic care operations. As a result, the Company anticipates a reduction in the overall gross margin with the amount of the reduction being dependent upon the ultimate contribution of chronic care to the total mix of revenues. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Company owned 100% of HMI on November 1, 1995, the gross profit margin for the year ended October 31, 1996 (including HMI) would have been 32.8% versus the actual 54.5% for the same period. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin.                    The Company amortizes goodwill over a period of 40 years. The Company has selected the forty-year amortization convention based on the likely period of time over which related economic benefits will be realized. The Company believes its estimated goodwill life is reasonable given, among other factors, the continuing movement of patient care to non-institutional settings, expanding demand due to demographic trends, the emphasis of the Company on establishing coverage in each of its local and regional markets and the consistent practice of other alternate site health care companies. At each balance sheet date, management assesses whether there has been a permanent impairment in the value of goodwill and the amount of any impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities with the carrying value of goodwill. The factors considered by management in estimating future cash flows include current operating results, trends and prospects of acquired businesses, as well as the effect of demand, competition, market and other economic factors.            RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1996 VS. YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1995                    Revenues. Total revenues increased by $4,717,000 or 6.6% to $76,304,000 for the year ended October 31, 1996 from $71,587,000 for the year ended October 31, 1995. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $4,388,000 or 10.3% in net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales resulting primarily from an increase in the number of patients serviced in the Company's specialty mail-order pharmacy and medical supplies operations.                    Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased by $1,950,000 or 6.0% to $34,680,000 for the year ended October 31, 1996 from $32,730,000 for the year ended October 31, 1995. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues remained relatively constant at 45.5% and 45.7% for the year ended October 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Cost of revenues as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales (39.2% for the year ended October 31, 1996 versus 39.3% for the corresponding 1995 period), but increased for patient services                                         -29-    33 (53.1% for the year ended October 31, 1996 versus 52.1% for the corresponding 1995 period) and decreased for infusion services (60.4% for the year ended October 31, 1996 versus 61.4% for the corresponding 1995 period).                    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3,778,000 or 12.7% to $33,552,000 for the year ended October 31, 1996 from $29,774,000 for the comparable 1995 period. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses at the Company's specialty mail-order pharmacy and medical supplies operations ($2,816,000) which increased principally as a result of the building of infrastructure (such as payroll and payroll related expenses and office expenses) in order to support the increased patient volumes ($1,849,000). The remaining increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $978,000 in corporate expenses including a charge of $456,000 in connection with the resignation of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer.                    Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net increased by $653,000 to $4,352,000 for the year ended October 31, 1996 from $3,699,000 for the comparable 1995 period. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense due to borrowings under the Subordinated Loan ($1,003,000), partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates under the senior secured credit facilities ($262,000).                    Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was 45.8% for the year ended October 31, 1996 and 42.2% for the year ended October 31, 1995. The increase in the effective tax rate from the 1995 period to the 1996 period was primarily attributable to higher levels of non-deductible expenses, primarily goodwill amortization.                    Net deferred tax assets, net of a valuation allowance, were $2,425,000 at October 31, 1996, an increase of $200,000 from net deferred tax assets of $2,225,000 at October 31, 1995, primarily as a result of an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. A valuation allowance, as required by Statements of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, was provided for deferred tax assets where it was not likely that such assets would be realized through future income levels nor future or prior tax liabilities. During fiscal 1996, the Company decreased the valuation allowance by $155,000 primarily due to the realization of state deferred tax assets based on current levels of income. Based on current levels of income, management expects that levels of future income should be sufficient to realize the net deferred tax assets.                     Income Before Extraordinary Loss. As a result of the foregoing, income before extraordinary loss increased by $1,159,000 to $2,018,000 for the year ended October 31, 1996 from $859,000 for the year ended October 31, 1995. Income before extraordinary loss for 1995 includes non-recurring charges of $2,376,000 after tax. Income before extraordinary loss decreased by $1,217,000 to $2,018,000 for the year ended October 31, 1996 from $3,235,000 for the year ended October 31, 1995, excluding the nonrecurring charges.                    Extraordinary Loss - Early Extinguishment of Debt. An extraordinary loss (net of tax benefit of $879,000) of $1,435,000 was recorded in the 1996 results of operations, as a result of the write-off of the deferred financing costs and discount associated with the early extinguishment of borrowings under the Paribas Credit Agreement.                    Net Income. As a result of the foregoing, net income decreased by $276,000 or 32.1% to $583,000 for the year ended October 31, 1996 from $859,000 for the year ended October 31, 1995. Net income in 1996 includes an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1,435,000 after tax, while net income for 1995 includes non-recurring charges of $2,376,000 after tax. Excluding this loss and charges, net income for the year ended October 31, 1996 would have been $2,018,000, a decrease of $1,217,000 or 37.6% from $3,235,000 for the year ended October 31, 1995.            YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1995 VS. YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1994                    Revenues. Total revenues increased by $31,864,000 or 80.2% to $71,587,000 for the year ended October 31, 1995 from $39,723,000 for the year ended October 31, 1994. This increase was attributed to: (i) the inclusion of DermaQuest for the year ended October 31, 1995 ($11,643,000 or 29.3%); (ii) the inclusion of RespiFlow and MK for the year ended October 31, 1995 (whereas                                         -30-    34 RespiFlow and MK were only included for seven months in the year ended October 31, 1994) ($10,552,000 or 26.5% for the five months ended March 31, 1995 and an increase of $3,167,000 or 8.0% for the seven months ended October 31, 1995 over the comparable period in 1994 due to increased volumes of respiratory and diabetic sales); (iii) the inclusion of Radamerica for the year ended October 31, 1995 (whereas Radamerica was only included for three months in the year ended October 31, 1994) ($5,491,000 or 13.8% for the nine months ended July 31, 1995 with relatively flat revenues for the three months ended October 31, 1995 over the comparable period in 1994); and (iv) the remaining $1,011,000 or 2.6%, primarily as a result of increased revenues in TNI's nursing and para-professional services due to higher levels of patients serviced ($1,252,000 or 3.2%) and, to a lesser extent, due to the inclusion of DVLC for seven months from the date of acquisition ($364,000 or .9%). These increases were offset by a decline of $616,000 or 1.6% in comparable infusion service revenues.                    Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased by $13,921,000 or 74.0% from $18,809,000 for the year ended October 31, 1994 to $32,730,000 for the year ended October 31, 1995. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues decreased from 47.4% to 45.7% for the years ended October 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively. This decrease was due to the higher mix of respiratory, medical equipment and supply sales as a result of the inclusion of RespiFlow, MK and DermaQuest for the year ended October 31, 1995, which generally have lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues (39.3%) than revenues derived from patient services (52.1%) and infusion services (61.4%). Respiratory, medical equipment and supply sales increased from 42.9% of total revenues for the year ended October 31, 1994 to 59.8% in the comparable 1995 period.                    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $13,806,000 or 86.5% from $15,968,000 for the year ended October 31, 1994 to $29,774,000 for the comparable 1995 period. This increase was attributable to: (i) the inclusion of DermaQuest for the year ended October 31, 1995 ($5,498,000 or 34.4%); (ii) the inclusion of RespiFlow and MK for the year ended October 31, 1995 (whereas RespiFlow and MK were only included for seven months in the year ended October 31, 1994) ($4,115,000 or 25.8% for the five months ended March 31, 1995 and an increase of $906 or 5.7% for the seven months ended October 31, 1995 over the comparable period in 1995 due primarily to an increase in incentive compensation under a management agreement); and (iii) the inclusion of Radamerica for the year ended October 31, 1995 (whereas Radamerica was only included for three months in the year ended October 31, 1994) (approximately $2,825,000 or 17.7%).                    Non-Recurring Charges. The Company recorded non-recurring charges totaling $3,898,000 in fiscal 1995 related to the write-off of costs related to an abandoned public offering ($2,808,000), abandoned acquisitions ($605,000) and the consolidation of certain of the Company's facilities ($485,000).                    Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net increased from $809,000 for the year ended October 31, 1994 to $3,699,000 for the comparable 1995 period. This increase was attributable to: (i) an increase in interest expense due primarily to interest expense on borrowings under the Paribas Credit Agreement ($2,758,000) which includes amortization of discounts and deferred financing costs ($902,000 in fiscal 1995); (ii) an increase in interest expense-related parties, net ($95,000); and (iii) a decrease in interest income primarily due to lower average cash balances ($37,000). See "--Liquidity and Capital Resources."                                         -31-    35                   Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of an accounting change was 42.2% for the year ended October 31, 1995 and 40.0% for the year ended October 31, 1994. The increase in the effective tax rate from the 1994 period to the 1995 period was attributable to a shift in the percentage mix of the Company's profits to jurisdictions with higher state tax rates.                    Net deferred tax assets, net of a valuation allowance, were $2,225,000 at October 31, 1995, an increase of $1,866,000 from net deferred tax assets of $359,000 at October 31, 1994, primarily as a result of an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. A valuation allowance, as required by SFAS No. 109, was provided for deferred tax assets where it was not likely that such assets would be realized through future income levels nor future or prior tax liabilities. During fiscal 1995, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $232,000 primarily as a result of the establishment of state net operating loss carryforwards. Based on current levels of income, management currently expects that levels of future income should be sufficient to realize the net deferred tax assets.                    Net Income. As a result of the foregoing, net income decreased by $1,922,000 or 69.1% from $2,781,000 for the year ended October 31, 1994 to $859,000 for the year ended October 31, 1995. Net income for 1995 includes non-recurring charges of $2,376,000 after tax, while net income for 1994 includes a $300,000 benefit for the cumulative effect of an accounting change for the adoption of SFAS No. 109. Excluding these charges and benefit, net income for the year ended October 31, 1995 would have been $3,235,000, an increase of $754,000 or 30.4% from $2,481,000 for the year ended October 31, 1994.            LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES                    During fiscal 1996, the Company experienced cash outflows from operations of $3,263,000, primarily as a result of an increase in accounts receivable of $5,032,000 (net of increases in allowance for doubtful accounts and receivables acquired in purchase transactions). The Company utilized $13,903,000 in investing activities, consisting of $11,078,000 for payments on acquisitions payable, $1,785,000 for acquisitions (primarily the acquisition of Health Meds), net of cash acquired, and $1,040,000 for capital expenditures. During fiscal 1995, the Company experienced cash outflows from operations of $1,335,000, primarily as a result of an increase in accounts receivable of $6,258,000 (net of increases in allowance for doubtful accounts and receivables acquired in purchase transactions). The Company utilized $10,391,000 in investing activities, consisting of $5,957,000 for payments on acquisitions payable, $3,529,000 for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $1,066,000 for capital expenditures, offset by $161,000 of payments received on notes receivable-related parties. During fiscal 1994, the Company generated positive cash flow from operations of $3,748,000 and utilized $15,163,000 in investing activities (including $12,832,000 for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $456,000 for capital expenditures).                    Cash requirements during the year ended October 31, 1996 for operating and investing activities were met through borrowings under the Paribas Credit Agreement, the Credit Facility and the $10,000,000 Subordinated Loan from HPII as well as with proceeds from the issuance of 4,400,000 Units to HPII at the Initial and Second Closings. Additional cash requirements in the 1995 and 1994 fiscal years were met through borrowings under the Paribas Credit Agreement.                                         -32-    36                    At October 31, 1996, the Company had positive working capital of $26,201,000 reflecting an increase of $30,907,000 from October 31, 1995 as a result of the payment of $14,805,000 of acquisitions payable and current maturities of long-term debt primarily due to the proceeds from issuance of Common Stock to HPII. At October 31, 1995, the Company had a working capital deficit of $4,706,000 as a result of acquisitions payable of $15,062,000 (including $5,973,000 related to RespiFlow/MK and $8,832,000 related to DermaQuest). Excluding acquisitions payable, the Company had positive working capital of $10,356,000. On January 10, 1996, the $5,973,000 acquisition payable related to Respiflow/MK was paid in cash. The Company paid the $8,832,000 acquisition payable during the fiscal year ended October 31, 1996 as follows: $4,000,000 was paid in cash through drawing of the letter of credit which was issued as collateral for DermaQuest contingent payments; $3,832,000 was paid through the issuance of 370,219 shares of Common Stock valued at $10.35 per share; and the remaining $1,000,000 acquisition payable balance plus accrued interest in cash through proceeds from the Initial Closing.                    The Company does not have pending any material commitments regarding capital expenditures, and any additional capital expenditures will be subject to applicable restrictions under the Credit Facility. Based on current planned capital expenditures, the Company believes it has adequate capital resources to conduct its operations for the next twelve months.                    It is anticipated that, until the acquisition of HMI is consummated by the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement, HMI will be able to meet its ordinary cash operating needs. If, however, HMI incurs additional or unusual costs, payment on its receivables slows, and/or it does not receive ordinary credit terms for the purchase of pharmaceutical product, as anticipated, it may require additional cash to fund operations, and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the Company, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. According to HMI, if the Merger Agreement is not consummated or HMI does not continue satisfactory relationships with its suppliers, it is likely that HMI will seek protection under the Federal Bankruptcy laws.                    Further expansion of the Company's business (particularly through acquisitions) may require the Company to incur additional debt or offer additional equity if cash generated from operations, cash on hand and amounts available under the Credit Facility are inadequate or not available to meet its needs. There can be no assurance that any such additional debt or equity will be available to the Company, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. In addition, covenants contained in the Credit Facility restrict the Company from entering into transactions not in the ordinary course of business, including making acquisitions and issuing capital stock, without consent.                    Accounts Receivable. The Company maintains a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically. At October 31, 1996 and 1995, $24,414,000 (26.9%) and $18,906,000 (25.2%), respectively, of the Company's total assets consisted of accounts receivable substantially from third-party payors. Such payors generally required substantial documentation in order to process claims. The collection time for accounts receivable is typically the longest for services that relate to new patients or additional services requiring medical review for existing patients.                                         -33-    37                    Accounts receivable increased by $5,508,000 from October 31, 1995 to October 31, 1996 principally for the following reasons: (i) an increase of $3,332,000 at DermaQuest, discussed below; and (ii) an increase of $2,961,000 at RespiFlow and MK related primarily to higher sales levels, partially offset by; (iii) a decrease of $785,000 in other miscellaneous activity.                    During fiscal 1996, the Company experienced a significant increase in accounts receivable at its DermaQuest operation whose main product lines include wound care and orthotic products. Medicare, to whom substantially all DermaQuest claims are initially submitted for payment, has subjected these claims to an extensive review process and, in many cases, has required DermaQuest to pursue payment through the fair hearing process of the Medicare intermediary. This has created significant delays in payments, in many cases extending beyond twelve months, leading to the significant buildup in accounts receivable and corresponding negative impact on cash flow. The Company believes that this trend will continue through the 1997 fiscal year. In establishing the net realizable value of its accounts receivable for DermaQuest, the Company has relied on its historical payment experience which includes its highly favorable outcomes in the fair hearing process. The Company believes that based on such prior favorable payment experience, current regulations and its billing and related documentation practices, there is no current basis to indicate that DermaQuest would be any less successful in the collection of its accounts receivable as reported.                    Management's goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry averages, which will tend to mitigate the risk of recurrence of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. Days sales outstanding ("DSOs") is a measure of the average number of days taken by the Company to collect its accounts receivable, calculated from the date services are rendered. For each of the years ended October 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company's average DSOs were 109, 97 and 65, respectively, with the increase for the year ended October 31, 1996 principally due to the factors previously discussed. As the proportion of third-party payors' claims related to alternate site health care increases, the Company believes that third-party payors are likely to increase their review of such claims, the effect of which would be to generally increase DSOs.                    Credit Facility. In March 1995, the Company amended and restated the Paribas Credit Agreement with Banque Paribas, as agent, which provided the Company with a $35,000,000 senior secured credit facility. On July 31, 1996, the Company completed a new $100,000,000 senior secured revolving credit facility, underwritten by Bankers Trust Company who is also acting as Agent Bank. The new Credit Facility replaced the Company's existing Paribas Credit Agreement, which was repaid out of proceeds from the Second Closing with HPII and borrowings under the Credit Facility (which closed concurrently). In connection with the repayment of the Paribas Credit Agreement, the Company recorded a non-cash, after-tax, extraordinary charge of $1,435,000 (net of tax benefit of $879,000) in the fiscal year ended October 31, 1996, relating to the write-off of the deferred financing costs and discount associated with the Paribas Credit Agreement.                    Pursuant to the Credit Facility and subject to the terms thereof, up to $85,000,000 of the total facility may be used by the Company for the acquisition of other alternate site health care providers with the balance not used for acquisitions to be used for working capital. Unused portions of the revolving loans may be borrowed and reborrowed at the Company's discretion subject to applicable provisions of the Credit Facility. The loans under the Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, a lien on substantially all of the Company's and its subsidiaries assets, a pledge of the Company's ownership interest in its subsidiaries and guaranties by the Company's subsidiaries. The                                         -34-    38  loans mature on July 31, 2001 with reductions in availability of funds commencing on July 31, 1998 through maturity. The Credit Facility provides that subject to the terms thereof, the Company may make borrowings either at the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility), plus 1% or the Eurodollar Rate, plus 2%. As of October 31, 1996 and January 22, 1997, Eurodollar Rate borrowings bore interest at a rate of 7.375% and 7.5% per annum, respectively. As of January 22, 1997, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $43,838,857 under the Credit Facility. Availability under the Credit Facility was $56,161,143 as of  January 22, 1997.                    The Company agreed to changes to its Credit Facility with its senior lenders in order to accommodate the purchase of the senior secured indebtedness of HMI and the 8,964,292 shares of HMI common stock purchased by the Company pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement. The principal changes include temporary adjustments to certain financial covenants until April 30, 1997, by which time the Company believes it will have either consummated the acquisition pursuant to the Merger Agreement and/or have obtained additional capital, such that it will be in compliance with the terms of the Credit Facility at that time. The Company also agreed that, until the acquisition of HMI has been consummated, any additional acquisitions would be subject to the specific approval of its senior lenders.                    Subject to certain exceptions, the Credit Facility prohibits or restricts, among other things, the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, certain fundamental corporate changes, dividends, the making of specified investments and certain transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as interest coverage, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and minimum EBITDA. At October 31, 1996, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility.                    RespiFlow/MK. During fiscal 1995, the Company paid approximately $5,877,000 of the $11,850,000 acquisition payable to the sellers in cash. The remaining acquisition payable of $5,973,000 as of October 31, 1995 was paid to the sellers on January 10, 1996 in cash, plus interest from its due date of August 15, 1995.                    Radamerica Price Support Payment. In connection with the Company's acquisition of Radamerica, the Company agreed that in the event the market value of the Common Stock on August 5, 1997 is less than $20 per share, the Company will pay to each Radamerica seller, for each share of Common Stock held by them at such time, an amount equal to the difference between the market value on such date and $20 (the "Radamerica Price Support Payment"). Based upon the closing price of the Common Stock on January 22, 1997, the Company's obligation under the Radamerica Price Support Payment would have been $2,296,875. The Company may pay the Radamerica Price Support Payment in whole or in part in shares of Common Stock or in cash within 30 days following a seller's demand therefor, which demand must be exercised by February 5, 1998. Any portion of the Radamerica Price Support Payment not paid when due will bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum.                    At the Radamerica closing, the Company loaned to two Radamerica sellers an aggregate of $1,100,000 in connection with the repayment of certain indebtedness owed to a former shareholder of Radamerica whose shares had been purchased by them. The principal and interest of the loans are due and payable on the date the Radamerica Price Support Payment is paid, or if no Radamerica Price Support Payment is due, on February 1, 1998, and are secured by a pledge of an aggregate of 83,334                                         -35-    39  shares of Common Stock. $136,000 of the loans had been repaid as of October 31, 1996. See "Business -- History of the Company."                    DermaQuest Acquisition. In connection with the Company's acquisition of DermaQuest, the Company recorded an acquisition payable of $8,832,000 at October 31, 1995 based on a formula applied to DermaQuest's 1995 pretax earnings. The Company paid such acquisition payable as follows: on January 16, 1996, $4,000,000 was paid in cash through drawings of the letter of credit which was issued as collateral for any DermaQuest contingent payments; $3,832,000 was paid through the issuance of 370,219 shares of Common Stock on February 1, 1996 valued at $10.35 per share; and on May 30, 1996, the Company paid the remaining $1,000,000 acquisition payable balance plus accrued interest in cash through proceeds from the Initial Closing.                    There are no additional payments required to be paid to the DermaQuest sellers based upon 1996 pretax earnings.                    If, by the first anniversary of the issuance of shares, the sellers have sold any such shares and the sale price of such shares is less than 90% of their initial valuation on the date of issuance, then the amount of such difference shall be paid to the sellers either in whole or in part at the option of the Company, in cash or in additional shares of Common Stock. If the sale price exceeds the initial valuation by more than 110%, then the difference shall be paid to the Company by the sellers in cash and shares of Common Stock in the same proportion of cash and Common Stock as the $8,832,000 was paid.                    The Company has agreed that from November 1, 1995 to October 31, 1999, RespiFlow, MK and DermaQuest will be managed by E/L Associates, an affiliate of certain selling shareholders of those entities. Pursuant to a management agreement, E/L Associates is entitled to receive an annual management fee of $240,000 for the fiscal year commencing November 1, 1995, increasing to $390,000 on November 1, 1996 and $490,000 on November 1, 1997 and an incentive fee with respect to RespiFlow, MK and DermaQuest equal to 7% of their annual pretax earnings, payable based on achieving minimum pretax earnings of    $3,800,000 at RespiFlow and MK combined and $3,000,000 at DermaQuest (in each case, without giving effect to interest charged on the Company's investment in RespiFlow, MK and DermaQuest). The Company has guaranteed the obligations of RespiFlow, MK and DermaQuest under this management agreement.                    Pending VIP Acquisition. Pursuant to the stock purchase agreements, the Company is required to pay to the sellers of the VIP Companies at the VIP Closing, $10,250,000 in cash (of which $750,000 and 145,455 shares of Common Stock valued at $750,000 has been posted as a contract deposit). The cash portion of the contract deposit has, with the Company's consent, been loaned to the VIP Companies to be used for working capital purposes. In addition, at the VIP Closing the Company will assume all stated liabilities of the VIP Companies as of the VIP Closing ($8,434,000 at September 30, 1996, which includes approximately $3,000,000 due to officers/ shareholders). The Company expects that some portion of such liabilities will be repaid with cash flows generated through operating activities of the VIP Companies. However, to the extent such cash flows are not sufficient, it may be necessary for the Company to use its own funds or obtain additional financing to repay the balance of such assumed liabilities, principally the amounts due to the former officers/shareholders.                    As of January 22, 1997, the Company has not received approval from its lenders under the Credit Facility to consummate the VIP Acquisition and there can be no assurance that such                                         -36-    40  approval will be obtained or, if obtained, will be on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, the consummation of the VIP Acquisition is subject to, among other things, various closing conditions, including the receipt of necessary governmental approvals (including the submission and approval of a plan of financing), the accuracy at closing of various representations and warranties and the compliance by the sellers with certain covenants and agreements contained in the stock purchase agreements. In July 1996, the Company announced that the consummation of the VIP Acquisition would not occur concurrently with the Second Closing under the Purchase Agreement with HPII, in that, among other things, the approvals and consents necessary to consummate the transactions had not been and could not be obtained at that time. The Company believes that the sellers are not in compliance with certain provisions contained in the stock purchase agreements concerning the VIP Companies and has notified the sellers of the VIP Companies regarding the same. The Company cannot predict when or whether all of the requisite consents and approvals will be obtained and the other closing conditions will be satisfied, and, regardless, when or whether the transaction will ultimately be consummated.                    If the Company defaulted under the VIP Acquisition agreements, it could suffer a loss of its contract deposit which has been posted as liquidated damages. In the event that the transaction is not consummated for reasons other than a Company default, the deposit is refundable to the Company.  In any event, the Company's liquidity will not be materially adversely impacted because the cash portion of the deposit was paid by the Company in the 1994 fiscal year.                    HPII Transaction. On November 20, 1995, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with HPII pursuant to which HPII agreed, subject to the conditions stated in the Purchase Agreement, to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,400,000 Units, at a purchase price of $9.00 per Unit for an aggregate purchase price of up to $39,600,000.                    On January 10, 1996, HPII loaned to the Company the principal amount of $10,000,000. The Subordinated Loan bore interest at the rate of 20% per annum through May 29, 1996 and 12% thereafter and was repaid on July 31, 1996 with proceeds from the Second Closing. The use of the proceeds of the loan  was as follows: (i) $6,217,000 to satisfy the remaining balance, plus accrued  interest on the RespiFlow/MK acquisition payable; (ii) $350,000 for expenses relating to the HPII transaction; and (iii) the balance of $3,433,000 to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes.                    On May 30, 1996, HPII purchased from the Company at the Initial Closing an aggregate of 600,000 Units for $5,400,000. The use of the proceeds of the issuance was as follows: (i) $1,027,000 to satisfy the remaining balance plus accrued interest on the DermaQuest acquisition payable; (ii) $802,000 of accrued interest on the Subordinated Loan; (iii) $1,350,000 to satisfy accounts payable; (iv) $340,000 for expenses related to the HPII transaction; and (v) the balance of $1,881,000 to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes.                    On July 31, 1996, the Company sold to HPII at a Second Closing an aggregate of 3,800,000 Units for $34,200,000, in addition to the Units sold at the Initial Closing described above. The use of the $34,200,000 proceeds of the issuance plus borrowings of $8,992,000 under the Credit Facility (which closed concurrently) were as follows: (i) $29,832,000 to satisfy the remaining balance plus accrued interest and fees under the Paribas Credit Agreement; (ii) $10,201,000 to satisfy the remaining balance plus accrued interest on the Subordinated Loan; (iii) $3,012,000 for expenses related to the Credit Facility; (iv) $125,000 to satisfy accounts payable; and (v) $22,000 for expenses related to the HPII transaction.                    The total number of Units sold to HPII was 4,400,000 which represents 4,400,000 shares of Common Stock and Warrants to purchase an additional 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The                                         -37-    41  aggregate number of shares represented (assuming all the Warrants are exercised),therefore, by all of the Units sold to HPII in connection with the Purchase Agreement was 7,400,000.                    The Warrants contained in the Units grant the holder thereof the right to purchase a share of Common Stock upon payment of the exercise price of $12.45 per share of Common Stock. The Warrants are exercisable at any time after issuance thereof until the fifth anniversary of the original issuance date. The Warrants contain provisions that protect the holders thereof against dilution by adjustment of the exercise price therefore (and, in certain instances, a related change in the number of shares of Common Stock underlying each Warrant) upon the occurrence of certain events, such as stock dividends, stock splits, mergers, a sale of substantially all of the Company's assets and other extraordinary events, as well as the issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock at a purchase price below the then effective exercise price of the Warrants (which initially is $12.45 per share).                    Pursuant to the Registration Agreement entered into at the Initial Closing, the Company granted to HPII registration rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock included in the Units and other shares of Common Stock, if any, acquired by HPII (collectively, the "Registrable Securities"). The Registration Agreement also grants to the holders of Registrable Securities certain "piggyback" rights to have Registrable Securities included in a registration statement to be filed by the Company for either its own benefit or for the registration of securities for the account of other shareholders of the Company. The Company will bear all expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, in connection with any such registrations.                    On January 8, 1997, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with HPII pursuant to which HPII agreed, subject to the conditions stated therein, to purchase 898,877 shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Additional Shares") at a purchase price of $11.125 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $10,000,000. Consummation of this transaction is subject to, among other things, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and may be completed at the Company's request, either prior to or concurrent with the HMI Merger Agreement subject to the terms of the stock purchase agreement. The Additional Shares are also covered by the Registration Agreement.                    Pending HMI Acquisition. On November 13, 1996, the Company acquired the senior secured indebtedness of HMI from HMI's Lenders. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the Supplemental Agreement, the Company also agreed to lend to HMI from time to time, up to $5,000,000 for working capital purposes and to forebear from exercising any remedies under the HMI Credit Agreement until January 31, 1997. As of January 22, 1997, the Company had advanced $4,649,285 to HMI for working capital purposes. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, on January 14, 1997, the Company acquired 8,964,292 shares of HMI common stock, representing approximately 49% of HMI's outstanding common stock for a cash purchase price of $8,964,292, which actual cash outlay was reduced by the $4,649,285 advanced for working capital purposes pursuant to the Supplemental Agreement. At the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the  Company and HMI also entered into the HMI Registration Agreement providing for the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, commencing on the earlier of June 30, 1997 or the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated, of the shares of HMI common stock acquired by the Company pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement and issuable upon the exercise of the Option. On November 13, 1996, HMI also issued to the Company the Option and the Company and HMI entered into the Merger Agreement, as amended, whereby HMI will be acquired by the Company at a price of $1.50 per share for each outstanding share of HMI common stock not already owned by the Company.                    Consummation of the Merger Agreement is subject to various conditions, including receipt of financing by the Company sufficient to complete the merger and approval                                         -38-    42  of the lenders under the Credit Facility, receipt of certain regulatory approvals and approval by HMI's shareholders.  See "Business -- History of the Company."                    The aggregate amount necessary to complete all aspects of the pending HMI acquisition (after giving effect to the purchase of HMI's senior debt, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Merger Agreement (including professional fees) and settlement of certain shareholder litigation, but exclusive of trade payables aggregating approximately $10,000,000) is approximately $60,000,000, all of which has been, or the Company anticipates, will be provided through borrowing's under the Credit Facility and the sale of $10,000,000 of the Additional Shares to HPII.                    Litigation. On November 2, 1994, an action was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Westchester by Celia M. Consiglio, individually and as administratrix of her husband's estate against the Company, alleging that one of its drivers negligently caused the death of the plaintiff's husband while operating his motor vehicle during a delivery for the Company. The plaintiffs are seeking $12,580,000 in damages for wrongful death, pain and suffering, loss of consortium and related claims. The Company has tendered a defense of this action to its insurance carrier and management of the Company and counsel to the insurance carrier intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit. As the case is in a preliminary stage, the Company is not able to estimate any potential exposure or range of exposure and has not recorded any amounts in its financial statements. It is reasonably possible that irrespective of insurance coverage, the ultimate outcome of this action may be materially unfavorable to the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, the Company believes that the ultimate liability, if any, will be within the policy limits of its insurance and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.                    See "Legal Proceedings" with respect to certain legal proceedings concerning HMI.            IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS                    In March 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," which requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets' carrying values be evaluated based on the future (undiscounted and without interest charges) cash flows expected to be realized from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss must be recognized. SFAS No. 121 is effective for fiscal years commencing after December 15, 1995. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 121 in fiscal 1997, is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.                    In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which prescribes a new method of accounting for stock-based compensation that determines compensation expense based on fair value measured at the grant date. SFAS No. 123 gives companies that grant stock options or other equity instruments to employees, the option of either                                         -39-    43  adopting the new rules or continuing current accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," however disclosure would be required of the pro forma amounts as if the new rules had been adopted. SFAS No. 123 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. The Company intends to continue current accounting and provide the disclosure only, as permitted under SFAS No. 123, beginning with its annual financial statements for the year ending October 31, 1997.            INFLATION                    Inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company's operations to date.   ITEM 8.           FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
