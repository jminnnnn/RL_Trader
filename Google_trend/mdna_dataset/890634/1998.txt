ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.           GENERAL           The Company changed its fiscal year to end on September 30 from October 31 effective for fiscal 1997. This resulted in an eleven month reporting period for the period ended September 30, 1997.           The Company is a provider of a broad range of home health care services and products with operations in the U.S. and the U.K. The Company provides the following services and products to patients in their homes: (i) specialty mail-order pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, respiratory therapy and home medical equipment; (ii) patient services, including home nursing and para-professional services; and (iii) infusion therapy. The Company's U.S. infusion and respiratory therapy services and home medical equipment operations are concentrated in New Jersey and New York while its specialty mail-order pharmaceutical and medical supplies operations provide products to patients nationwide and in Puerto Rico. The Company's U.K. Operations include the second largest commercial provider of home nursing and para-professional care, the U.K.'s second largest respiratory supplier as well as a leading medical supplies distributor all with operations located throughout the U.K.           The Company has made significant strides toward becoming one of the only integrated national providers of home and alternative site health care in the U.K. through the 1997 purchases of Omnicare for approximately $31,000,000 and Allied for approximately $60,000,000. Omnicare provides respiratory equipment and services and supplies a range of medical and surgical products to patients at home throughout the U.K. through its network of seven regional facilities. Allied is a national provider of nursing and other care giving services to home care patients with 69 locations throughout the U.K. The Company intends to utilize its recently acquired U.K. Operations as a platform to introduce new products and services to the U.K. market which have already been widely accepted in the U.S., as well as for add-on acquisitions. The Company believes the U.K. home health care market is less developed than in the U.S. and presents a significant opportunity to leverage its existing expertise in home health care.           The Company took a number of significant steps during the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998 and the Eleven Month Period to realign its business as a focused regional home health care provider and specialty pharmacy and medical supply distributor in the U.S. and as an integrated national provider of home and alternate site health care products and services in the U.K. These steps included (i) selling non-core assets such as the Company's Radamerica business which provided radiation therapy in the Baltimore, Maryland area and the Company's TNI operations, which provided nursing and para-professional services in New Jersey and Florida; (ii) exiting businesses that were deemed not to have the potential to earn an adequate return on capital over the long term (such as wound care and orthotic product lines in the continental U.S., as well as the Company's pulmonary                                       -21-   rehabilitation center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey); (iii) completing the HMI Asset Sale; and (iv) terminating the agreements to purchase the VIP Companies.           The Company's revenue mix and payor mix will be influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles. Assuming the Company owned 100% of Omnicare and Allied on November 1, 1996, the products and services offered by these companies would have accounted for approximately 47.9% of the combined pro forma revenue ($141,231,000) for the Eleven Month Period. The following table shows the percentage of historical net revenues represented by each of the  Company's product lines:                                                               Eleven Months                                             Year Ended         Ended        Year Ended                                            September 30,    September 30,   October 31,                                                1998             1997           1996                                                ----             ----           ----        Product Line - ------------ Net respiratory, medical   equipment and supplies sales.........         49.0%           56.3%          61.8% Net patient services...................         44.4            31.9           25.1 Net infusion services..................          6.6            11.8           13.1                                                -----           -----          -----                    Total revenues.......        100.0%          100.0%         100.0%                                                =====           =====          =====             The increase in net patient services (and a corresponding decline in net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales and net infusion services as a percentage of total revenues) from the year ended October 31, 1996 to the Eleven Month Period and from the Eleven Month Period to the year ended September 30, 1998 resulted primarily from the acquisition of Allied (effective June 23, 1997). Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Company owned 100% of Omnicare and Allied on November 1, 1996, the percentage of total revenues for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 would have been as follows: net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales 47.3%, net patient services 44.9%; and net infusion services 7.8%.           The following table shows the payor mix for the Company's total revenues for the periods presented:                                                      Eleven Months                                     Year Ended        Ended       Year Ended                                    September 30,  September 30,   October 31, Payor                                  1998            1997           1996 - -----                                  ----            ----           ----        Medicare.........................      27.2%           42.0%          49.8% Medicaid.........................       5.8            11.2           11.8 Private payors...................      37.3            33.9           38.4 U.K. NHS and other governmental payors..............      29.7            12.9              -                                       -----           -----          -----           Total revenues..........     100.0%          100.0%         100.0%                                       =====           =====          =====             The decrease in Medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 1998 as compared to the Eleven Month Period and the Eleven Month Period as compared to fiscal 1996 is primarily a result of the Omnicare and Allied acquisitions. The Company believes that its payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, from shifts in existing                                       -22-   business among payors. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Company owned 100% of Omnicare and Allied on November 1, 1996, the payor mix for the Eleven Months Period would have been as follows: Medicare 27.8%; Medicaid 7.4%; private payors (including managed care payors) 34.4%; and U.K. NHS and other governmental payors 30.4%.           The Company believes that a substantial portion of its revenues derived from private payors was subject to case management and managed care and that this relationship will continue in the future. The Company maintains a diversified offering of home services and products in an attempt to mitigate the impact of potential reimbursement reductions for any individual product or service.           Due to changing interpretation of regulations and statutes by federal and state regulatory bodies, the specialty pharmacy industry has been subject to pressure related to its marketing of diabetic supplies to physicians and other referral sources. In addition, HCFA implemented new procedures regarding the dispensing of diabetic supplies to patients as of October 1, 1998. These and other regulatory changes may have a negative impact on revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses of the Company's diabetic supplies businesses in the future (which contributed approximately 14.1% of revenue for the year ended September 30, 1998), although the ultimate impact cannot be determined at this time.           The Company's gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of its product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates. The Company historically has recognized higher gross margins from its specialized mail-order and medical supplies pharmacy and respiratory therapy operations than from its nursing and infusion therapy operations. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Company owned 100% of Omnicare and Allied on November 1, 1996, the gross profit margin for the Eleven Month Period would have been 38.8% versus the actual 45.1% for the same period. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin.           The Company amortizes goodwill over a period of 40 years. The Company has selected the forty-year amortization convention based on the likely period of time over which related economic benefits will be realized. The Company believes its estimated goodwill life is reasonable given, among other factors, the continuing movement of patient care to non-institutional settings, expanding demand due to demographic trends, the emphasis of the Company on establishing coverage in each of its local and regional markets and the consistent practice of other home health care companies. At each balance sheet date, management assesses whether there has been a permanent impairment in the value of goodwill and the amount of any impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities with the carrying value of goodwill. The factors considered by management in estimating future cash flows include current operating results, trends and prospects of acquired businesses, as well as the effect of demand, competition, market and other economic factors.           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 VS. ELEVEN MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997.           Revenues. Total revenues increased by $61,865,000 or 66.2% to $155,309,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $93,444,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 with $13,153,000 accounting for the one additional months revenue in fiscal 1998. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of eleven months of results for the year ended September 30, 1998 versus three months in the comparable prior period for Allied ($42,322,000 in patient services) and Omnicare ($16,735,000 in respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales) as well as an increase in respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales due primarily to an increase in the number of patients serviced in the Company's specialty                                       -23-   mail-order pharmacy and medical supplies operations ($5,395,000). These increases were partly offset by a decrease in patient services revenue attributable to the sale of Radamerica and the TNI Sale ($8,830,000), decreases in respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales due to exiting certain product lines of DermaQuest beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 ($2,719,000) as well as a reduction in revenue due to the Balanced Budget Act ($1,846,000) and lower infusion services revenue ($1,836,000) due to a decline in number of patients serviced.           Pursuant to the passage of the Balanced Budget Act, a 10% reduction in Medicare reimbursement of diabetic testing strips and a 5% reduction in Medicare reimbursement of respiratory drugs became effective January 1, 1998. These reductions reduced revenue, increased cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues and decreased gross profit for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction (as discussed herein).           In addition, pursuant to the Social Security Act's authority to HCFA to alter certain reimbursement rates that are not inherently reasonable, Medicare is proposing further reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates becoming effective as follows: (i) January 1, 1999 up to an additional 3.38% reduction for diabetic testing strips (depending on the state); (ii) January 1, 1999 a 15% reduction for diabetic lancets; (iii) January 1, 2000 an additional 15% reduction for diabetic lancets; (iv) January 1, 2001 an additional 2.32% reduction for diabetic lancets; and (v) January 1, 1999 a 10.5% reduction for albuterol (a respiratory drug). These reductions are expected to increase cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, decrease gross profit and decrease operating income for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction. The amount of the impact will be dependent upon product mix, the amount of product cost concessions that the Company is able to obtain from its suppliers and the number of patients serviced whose primary insurance coverage is Medicare.           Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased by $45,805,000 to $97,192,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $51,387,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 with $7,920,000 accounting for the one additional months cost of revenues in fiscal 1998. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues increased to 62.6% from 55.0% for the year ended September 30, 1998 and eleven months ended September 30, 1997, respectively. Cost of revenues as a percentage of sales increased for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales (55.0% for the year ended September 30, 1998 versus 48.9% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997) increased for patient services (69.4% for the year ended September 30, 1998 versus 60.8% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997) and increased for infusion services (73.4% for the year ended September 30, 1998 versus 68.6% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997). The increase in cost of revenues of respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 1998 are primarily attributable to the impact of the recent Balanced Budget Act, which reduced revenues for diabetic testing strips by 10% and respiratory drugs by 5% effective January 1, 1998 for Medicare patients and the inclusion of a full year of Omnicare's results (versus three months in the comparable period) which carry a higher cost of revenues (70.7%) than the U.S. respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales operations (47.6%). The increase in patient services costs as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 1998 are due to the inclusion of Allied's results for a full year (versus three months in the comparable prior period) which carry a cost of revenues of 69.4% and the sale of Radamerica in July 1997 which carried a lower cost of service (26.4%). The increase in infusion services is a result of an increase in therapies with higher product costs as well as the effects of reduced reimbursement rates for certain payors.           Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $8,495,000 or 19.8% to $51,426,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $42,931,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 with $4,217,000 accounting for the one additional months expenses                                       -24-   in fiscal 1998. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of eleven months of results for fiscal 1998 versus three months in the comparable prior period for the U.K. Operations ($12,952,000) and additional costs incurred for overhead related to sales efforts, collections and additional bad debt expense based upon a higher level of revenue partly offset by the recording of $7,023,000 of additional bad debt expense recorded in the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 primarily related to the Company's DermaQuest product lines ($6,060,000) and pulmonary rehabilitation center ($663,000) and the sale in July 1997 of Radamerica ($2,922,000).           Gain on Sale of Assets. For the year ended September 30, 1998 the Company recorded a $2,511,000 gain on the TNI Sale. For the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 the Company recorded a $606,000 gain on the sale of Radamerica.           Special Charges. For the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company recorded $554,000 of special charges primarily relating to costs incurred from its attempted acquisitions of Healthcall and Apria. The Company recorded special charges of $34,836,000 during the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 related to the following items: (i) $20,000,000 non-cash charge related to impairment of the investment in HMI as well as to record estimated costs, fees and other expenses related to completion of the HMI Asset Sale (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); (ii) $12,079,000 non-cash charge for the write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets related to exiting the wound care and orthotic product lines of the Company's DermaQuest subsidiary; (iii) $1,622,000 non-cash charge for the termination of the agreements to purchase the VIP Companies; (iv) $437,000 charge for closure of the Company's pulmonary rehabilitation center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey; and (v) $698,000 of other charges.           Equity of Losses of HMI, Net. Equity in losses of HMI was $296,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997. This represented 49% of HMI's losses for the three months ended April 30, 1997. The 49% interest in HMI was acquired in mid January 1997 and was included in the results of operations effective February 1, 1997. Equity in losses of HMI for the three months ended July 31, 1997 were accounted for in adjusting the investment in HMI to estimated net realizable value and was included as a component of the non-cash charge recorded during that period. Due to the Company's decision on August 1, 1997 to dispose of HMI, no equity in HMI losses were recorded subsequent to July 31, 1997.           Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $2,015,000 to $635,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $2,650,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 with $65,000 attributable to the one additional months interest income in fiscal 1998. The gross decrease was primarily attributable to interest income earned (after elimination of intercompany interest) under a credit agreement with HMI ($1,796,000) for the eleven months of 1997 and lower interest income earned on a lower level of funds invested in fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal 1997.           Interest Expense. Interest expense, increased by $1,223,000 to $6,286,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $5,063,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 with $585,000 accounting for the one additional months interest expense in fiscal 1998. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to an increased level of borrowings under the Credit Facility in the early part of fiscal 1998.           Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was a provision of 61.5% for the year ended September 30, 1998 and a benefit of 13.4% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997. The difference between the 61.5% effective tax rate for fiscal 1998 and the statutory tax rate resulted from non-deductible expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets.                                       -25-            Net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, were $8,674,000 at September 30, 1998, an increase of $970,000 from net deferred tax assets of $7,704,000 at September 30, 1997, primarily as a result of an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and federal net operating loss carryforwards. A valuation allowance, was provided for deferred tax assets where it was not likely that such assets would be realized through future income levels nor future or prior tax liabilities. During fiscal 1998, the Company decreased the valuation allowance by $114,000 primarily due to utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards. Management expects that it is more likely than not that future levels of income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets, as recorded.           Net Income (Loss). As a result of the foregoing, the Company produced net income of $1,153,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 compared to net loss of $32,735,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997.            ELEVEN MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 VS. ELEVEN MONTHS ENDED          SEPTEMBER 30, 1996.           Revenues. Total revenues increased by $25,541,000 or 37.6% to $93,444,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 from $67,903,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1996. This increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of Allied ($14,186,000) and Omnicare ($5,661,000) and an increase of $5,151,000 or 12.3% in net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales resulting primarily from an increase in the number of patients serviced in the Company's specialty mail-order pharmacy and medical supplies operations. Net infusion service revenues also increased by $2,314,000 or 26.5% due primarily to the inclusion of USNJ for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997.           Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased by $20,470,000 or 66.2% to $51,387,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 from $30,917,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1996. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues increased to 55.0% from 45.5% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Cost of revenues as a percentage of sales increased for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales (48.9% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 versus 39.3% for the corresponding 1996 period), increased for infusion services (68.6% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 versus 59.9% for the corresponding 1996 period) and increased for patient services (60.8% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 versus 53.2% for the corresponding 1996 period). The increases in the respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales is primarily attributable to an increase in the mix of higher cost products at the Company's specialty pharmacy operations. The increase in patient services was as a result of an increase in nursing and para-professional services which carry a higher cost of service (69.2%) than does radiation therapy (26.4%). Cost of patient services is expected to increase as a percentage of patient service revenues in the future as a result of the sale of Radamerica in July 1997 and inclusion of Allied (which was acquired on June 23, 1997). The increase in infusion services is as a result of an increase in therapies with higher product costs, as well as the effects of reduced reimbursement rates for certain payors.           Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $12,869,000 to $43,931,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 from $30,062,000 for the comparable 1996 period. This increase was principally due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses at the Company's specialty mail-order pharmacy and medical supplies operations ($8,262,000) which increased primarily due to additional bad debt expense for DermaQuest product lines ($6,060,000). Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was the inclusion of the U.K. Operations ($4,080,000) and additional bad debt expense for the Company's pulmonary rehabilitation center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey ($663,000).                                       -26-            Gain on Sale of Assets. For the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 the Company recorded a $606,000 gain on the sale of Radamerica.           Special Charges. The Company recorded special charges of $34,836,000 during the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 related to the following items: (i) $20,000,000 non-cash charge related to impairment of the investment in HMI as well as to record estimated costs, fees and other expenses related to completion of the HMI Asset Sale (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); (ii) $12,079,000 non-cash charge for the write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets related to exiting the wound care and orthotic product lines of the Company's DermaQuest subsidiary; (iii) $1,622,000 non-cash charge for the termination of the agreements to purchase the VIP Companies; (iv) $437,000 charge for closure of the Company's pulmonary rehabilitation center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey; and (v) $698,000 of other charges.           Equity in Losses of HMI, Net. Equity in losses of HMI was $296,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 versus $0 for the comparable 1996 period. This represented 49% of HMI's losses for the four months ended April 30, 1997. The 49% interest in HMI was acquired in mid January 1997 and included in the results of operations effective February 1, 1997. Equity in losses of HMI for the three months ended July 31, 1997 were accounted for in adjusting the investment in HMI to estimated net realizable value and was included as a component of the non-cash charge recorded during that period. Due to the Company's decision on August 1, 1997 to dispose of HMI, no equity in HMI losses were recorded subsequent to July 31, 1997.           Interest Income. Interest income increased by $2,584,000 to $2,650,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 from $66,000 for the comparable 1996 period. This increase was principally attributable to interest income earned, after the elimination of intercompany interest (49%) for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, under a credit agreement with HMI ($1,796,000) and interest earned on funds received from HPII in connection with the purchase of the Company's Common Stock (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).           Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $834,000 to $5,063,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 from $4,229,000 for the comparable 1996 period. This increase was primarily attributable to increased borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility.           (Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. (Benefit) provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was a benefit of 13.4% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 versus a provision of 45.7% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1996. The effective rate of 13.4% for the 1997 period was principally a result of both the nondeductibility of the write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets related to DermaQuest and the market write-down on the investment in HMI (see Special Charges).           Net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, were $7,704,000 at September 30, 1997, an increase of $5,279,000 from net deferred tax assets of $2,425,000 at October 31, 1996, primarily as a result of an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and federal net operating loss carryforwards. A valuation allowance, was provided for deferred tax assets where it was not likely that such assets would be realized through future income levels nor future or prior tax liabilities. During fiscal 1997, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $1,859,000 primarily due to the increase in deferred tax assets for state net operating loss carryforwards which are not expected to be realized. Management expects that it is more likely than not that future levels of income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets, as recorded.                                       -27-            Net (Loss) Income. As a result of the foregoing, the Company incurred a net loss of $32,735,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 compared to net income of $63,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1996. Included in net income for 1996 was an extraordinary loss, net of $1,435,000 resulting from an early existinguishment of debt.            LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           GENERAL.           During the year ended September 30, 1998 the Company received  $22,241,000 from investing activities as follows: $32,328,000 received from the HMI Asset Sale partly offset by $11,122,000 paid to complete the merger with HMI as well as for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger and to satisfy existing HMI obligations which were retained by the Company; $6,029,000 received from asset sales net of utilization of $3,346,000 for capital expenditures and $1,648,000 for acquisitions and purchases of other intangibles. Funds generated by investing activities along with net proceeds of $6,492,000 from the exercise of the Company's warrants were used to reduce the Company's borrowings under the Credit Facility by $29,100,000 and to fund operating  activities.           During the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company utilized $130,302,000 ($117,138,000 net of proceeds from asset sales and other miscellaneous transactions) in investing activities as follows: $93,586,000 for the acquisition of the U.K. Operations (Omnicare and Allied); $32,189,000 for the purchase of 49% of HMI and HMI's senior debt and related advances; $2,694,000 for capital expenditures and $1,833,000 for acquisitions payable. In addition, the Company utilized $2,653,000 for operating activities. Substantially all of the financing for the operating and investing activities was provided by net borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility of $73,864,000, the equity investment by HPII and Hyperion TW Fund L.P. (the "Fund") aggregating $50,650,000 and proceeds of $12,100,000 from the sale of Radamerica.           During fiscal 1996, the Company experienced cash outflows from operations of $6,594,000 primarily as a result of an increase in accounts receivable of $5,032,000 (net of increases in allowance for doubtful accounts and receivables acquired in purchase transactions) and payments for debt discounts and issuance costs. The Company utilized $13,903,000 in investing activities, consisting of $11,078,000 for payments on acquisitions payable, $1,785,000 for acquisitions (primarily the acquisition of Health Meds), net of cash acquired, and $1,040,000 for capital expenditures.           The Company believes it has adequate capital resources to conduct its operations for the next twelve months. Further expansion of the Company's business (particularly through acquisitions) may require the Company to incur additional debt or offer additional equity securities if cash generated from operations, cash on hand and amounts available under the Credit Facility are inadequate or not available to meet its needs. There can be no assurance that any such additional debt or equity will be available to the Company, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. In addition, covenants contained in the Credit Facility restrict the Company from entering into transactions not in the ordinary course of business, including making acquisitions and issuing capital stock, without consent.           ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.           The Company maintains a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 1998 and                                       -28-   1997, $29,614,000 (16.4%) and $31,475,000 (15.6%), respectively, of the Company's total assets consisted of accounts receivable substantially from third-party payors. Such payors generally required substantial documentation in order to process claims. The collection time for accounts receivable is typically the longest for services that relate to new patients or additional services requiring medical review for existing patients.           Accounts receivable decreased by $1,861,000 from September 30, 1997 to September 30, 1998 primarily due to the TNI Sale ($1,499,000).           During fiscal 1996 and the eleven month period ended September 30, 1997, the Company experienced a significant increase in accounts receivable at its DermaQuest operation whose main product lines include wound care and orthotic products. Medicare, to whom substantially all DermaQuest claims are initially submitted for payment, has subjected these claims to an extensive review process and, in many cases, has required DermaQuest to pursue payment through the fair hearing process of the Medicare intermediary. This has created significant delays in payments, in many cases extending beyond twelve months, leading to the significant buildup in accounts receivable and corresponding negative impact on cash flow. The Company conducted an extensive review of the DermaQuest receivables in connection with the decision to discontinue these product lines in the continental U.S. and, as a result, established additional reserves of $6,060,000 based on the potential inability to secure required documentation in a timely manner for reimbursement as a result of no longer being in these business lines. In establishing the net realizable value of its accounts receivable for DermaQuest, the Company has relied on its historical and anticipated payment experience. The Company believes that based on current regulations, its billing and related documentation practices, and its extensive review, the DermaQuest accounts receivable reflect the net realizable value of these receivables.           Management's goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry averages, which will tend to mitigate the risk of recurrence of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. Days sales outstanding ("DSOs") is a measure of the average number of days taken by the Company to collect its accounts receivable, calculated from the date services are rendered. For the year ended September 30, 1998, the Eleven Month Period and the year ended October 31, 1996, the Company's average DSOs were 67, 73 and 109, respectively. As the proportion of third-party payors' claims related to alternate site health care increases, the Company believes that third-party payors are likely to increase their review of such claims, the effect of which would be to generally increase DSOs.           CREDIT FACILITY.           The Company has a senior secured revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks. Subject to certain exceptions, the Credit Facility prohibits or restricts, among other things, the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, certain fundamental corporate changes, dividends, the making of specified investments and certain transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as interest coverage, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and minimum EBITDA. At March 31, 1998 and June 30, 1998, the Company was in technical default of the Credit Facility due to non-compliance with certain financial covenants (interest coverage, debt to EBITDA and minimum EBITDA). On August 13, 1998, the Credit Facility was amended to adjust certain covenants for 1998 and 1999 bringing the Company into compliance with the Credit Facility.           Unused portions of the revolving loans may be borrowed and reborrowed subject to the approval of the required lenders and other applicable provisions of the Credit Facility, as amended. The loans mature on July 31, 2001 with reductions in availability of funds which commenced on July 31, 1998 and continue through maturity.                                       -29-   The Credit Facility provides that subject to the terms thereof, the Company may make borrowings either at the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility), plus 1% or the Eurodollar Rate, plus 2%. As of September 30, 1998 and December 1, 1998, Eurodollar Rate borrowings bore interest at a rate of 7.375% to 7.5625% and 7% to 7.25% per annum, respectively. As of December 1, 1998, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $57,255,000 under the Credit Facility. The unused portion of the Credit Facility was $33,645,000 as of December 1, 1998.           The loans under the Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, a lien on substantially all of the Company's and its subsidiaries assets, a pledge of the Company's ownership interest in its subsidiaries and guaranties by the Company's subsidiaries.           In connection with the consummation of the merger with HMI and the subsequent disposition to Counsel Corporation ("Counsel") hereinafter described, the Company also entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility with its senior lenders which amendment provided for, among other things, the lenders consenting to the merger with HMI and the sale to Counsel on the terms contained in the amendment.           As of August 10, 1998, the Company amended the Credit Facility to accommodate the TNI Sale. (See "TNI Sale").           TNI SALE.           On July 15, 1998, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its domestic home nursing subsidiary for $5,300,000 which was paid in cash at closing. Subject to the terms of the agreement, $300,000 of such amount was placed into escrow for a period of one year following the closing to secure TNI's obligations under the agreement. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce borrowings under the Credit Facility ($4,100,000) and to satisfy transaction costs and liabilities that were retained by the Company.           ACQUISITION OF HMI/SALE TO COUNSEL.           On October 1, 1997, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the previously announced merger with HMI. Under the terms of a merger agreement, HMI stockholders received $.30 in cash for each outstanding share of HMI common stock not already owned by the Company. Concurrently with the closing of the merger, the Company completed the HMI Asset Sale to Counsel for $40,000,000 at which time substantially all of the businesses and operations of HMI were sold to Counsel. Of the $40,000,000 proceeds, $30,000,000 was received in cash with $7,500,000 to be paid to the Company as HMI's accounts receivable, existing at date of sale, were collected, with the remaining $2,500,000 held in escrow for post-closing adjustments. As of September 30, 1998 an aggregate (including interest earned on such escrow funds) of $37,648,000 was received (including the $7,500,000 escrow that was held for accounts receivable collection) of which, $25,000,000 was used to reduce the senior secured debt owed by the Company under the Credit Facility, $2,800,000 was used to complete the merger and the remainder was used for costs, fees and other expenses to complete the HMI Asset Sale as well as to satisfy liabilities not assumed by Counsel. The remaining $2,500,000 escrow was fully utilized for post-closing adjustments.           Pursuant to the HMI Asset Sale, Counsel did not assume any liabilities of HMI other than certain liabilities arising after the closing under assumed contracts and certain employee-related liabilities. Satisfaction of liabilities not assumed by Counsel, as well as certain wind-down and contingent obligations of HMI (including litigation - see "Legal Proceedings" with respect to certain legal proceedings concerning HMI), have been considered in determining the Company's consolidated financial position.                                       -30-            YEAR 2000.           General. The Year 2000 computer issue refers to potential conditions in computer programs whereby a two-digit field rather than a four-digit field is used to define the applicable year. Unless corrected, some computer programs may be unable to appropriately function on January 1, 2000 because these programs will read the "00" in the year 2000 as January 1, 1900. If uncorrected, the problem could result in computer system failures or equipment and medical device malfunctions (affecting patient diagnosis and treatment) thereby disrupting the Company's business operations and subjecting the Company to potentially significant legal liabilities.           During the early part of 1998, the Company formed a task force consisting of members of senior management, in-house legal counsel, representatives from each of the Company's operating subsidiaries (in both the U.S. and the U.K.), and other Company personnel. The task force also consults with the Company's insurance carrier and risk management advisors. The task force developed an action plan to address the potential problems of the Year 2000, which considered the following critical phases: (i) the Company's state of readiness; (ii) risks of the Company's Year 2000 issues; (iii) costs to address Year 2000 compliance; and (iv) the Company's contingency plans.           Company's State of Readiness. The information technology ("IT") and IT infrastructure portions of the Company's Year 2000 project, address the inventory, assessment, necessary corrective actions, testing and implementation of external vendor products, mission critical third-party software and internally developed software. In that regard, the Company believes it has identified (in both the U.S. and the U.K.), the various software applications that may be potentially impacted. The Company's assessment of all IT related components is currently underway and the Company anticipates completing, in most respects, any remediation of external vendor products, mission critical third-party software and internally developed software by March 31, 1999. The Company also expects that by June 30, 1999, implementation and testing of all remediation will be complete.           With respect to the non-IT portion of the Company's Year 2000 project, the Company has undertaken a program to inventory, assess and correct or replace (where necessary) impacted mission critical as well as non-mission critical vendor and supplier products (including but not limited to drugs, medical supplies and specialty mail-order pharmaceutical products), medical equipment, telephone systems, postage machines and other related equipment with Year 2000 risk. These types of supplies and equipment play a vital role in the day to day operations of the Company. The Company is implementing (in both the U.S. and the U.K.), a program of contacting vendors and suppliers, analyzing and acting upon information provided to replace or otherwise amend any devices or equipment that pose a Year 2000 impact. The Company is prioritizing its non-IT efforts by allocating resources to equipment and medical devices that will have a direct impact on patient safety and health with a goal of minimizing and/or eliminating the associated risks. The Company recognizes, to a certain degree, that it is relying upon information that is being provided by equipment and medical device manufacturers regarding the Year 2000 status of their respective products. While the Company is attempting to evaluate information provided by its present vendors and suppliers, there can be no assurance that in all instances accurate information is being provided. The Company's assessment of potentially non-IT affected components is currently underway and the Company anticipates completing, in most respects, any required corrective actions by March 31, 1999. The Company expects that by June 30, 1999, implementation and testing of all remediation will be complete.                                       -31-            Lastly, the Company relies heavily upon third party payors, including to a large extent governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. and the NHS in the U.K. for accurate and timely reimbursement of claims, often through the use of electronic data interfaces. Although much has been published publicly stating that the government is working to solve its own Year 2000 issues in a timely manner, the Company has received no assurance that their systems and interfaces will be converted timely. Failure of any of the Company's third party payors, especially governmental payors, to solve their Year 2000 issues could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.           Risks of the Company's Year 2000 Issues. Failure from any of the aforementioned IT and/or non-IT equipment and components, including the support from third parties, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operations (in both the U.S. and the U.K.) resulting in the potential inability to provide health care services to its patients. This inability could result in the loss of revenue (which at the present time is unable to be quantified) and give rise to litigation. Failure of the third party payor's systems also could have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.           Costs to Address Year 2000 Compliance. As of December 1, 1998 costs incurred for all efforts of the Company's Year 2000 action plan amount to $3,000 and have not been material to the Company. These costs have been expensed as incurred and have been funded by operating cash flows. The remaining cost of the Year 2000 project is expected to be approximately $152,000 and is based upon the best estimates from the Company's management and the Year 2000 task force. This cost will also be expensed as incurred and be funded by operating cash flows. These estimates as well as anticipated completion dates were derived by consideration of availability of resources, utilizing assumptions and relying upon third party representations. However, there can be no guarantees that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could be materially different.           The Company's Contingency Plans. Each operating subsidiary (both in the U.S. and the U.K.) has been asked to develop a contingency plan to restore the material functions of each of its systems or activities in the case of a Year 2000 failure. The respective subsidiaries are in the preliminary stages of defining these plans and will make them more comprehensive, as additional information becomes available through testing and external sources.           There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete all of the modifications in the required time frame, that unanticipated events will not occur or that the Company will be able to identify all Year 2000 issues before problems arise. In addition, the Company has no assurance that third party payors and vendors will have the ability to identify and solve all or substantially all their Year 2000 issues. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Year 2000 issue will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows and results of operations.           LITIGATION.           See "Legal Proceedings" with respect to certain legal proceedings concerning the Company and HMI.           IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS           In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components (revenues, expenses, gains and losses) in the financial statements. SFAS No. 130 requires that all items that are recognized under accounting standards and components of comprehensive income be reported in a                                       -32-   financial statement, that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. SFAS No. 130 addresses disclosure issues; and therefore, will not have any effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. SFAS No. 130 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997 and the Company will adopt in the first quarter of fiscal 1999.           Also in June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131, which supersedes SFAS No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise," changes the way public companies report information about segments by moving to the management approach to segment reporting. In addition, SFAS No. 131 has requirements relating to disclosure of products, services, customers, and the material countries in which the entity holds assets and reports revenues. As with SFAS No. 130, SFAS No. 131 addresses disclosure issues and therefore will not have an effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. SFAS No. 131 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 1997.           In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 addresses the accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. As the Company currently does not enter into transactions involving derivative instruments, the Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999.            INFLATION           Inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company's operations to date.  ITEM 8.       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
