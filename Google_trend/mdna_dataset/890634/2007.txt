Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    General    The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in conjunction with the description of our business included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position. This discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainty. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.’’    We are a leading provider of flexible, or temporary, healthcare staffing to the healthcare industry in the United Kingdom, as measured by revenues, market share and number of staff. As of September 30, 2007 we operated an integrated network of approximately 100 branches throughout most of the United Kingdom. Our healthcare staff consists principally of homecare aides (known as carers in the U.K.), nurses and nurses aides. We maintain a listing of over 12,000 homecare aides, nurses and nurses aides, a majority of whom we placed during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2007.    In September 2007, we disposed of two of our U.K. subsidiaries when we sold all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Allied Respiratory Limited and Medigas Limited for £36.5 million ($74.7 million) in cash, of which £500,000 ($1.0 million) is being held back until certain conditions are met. Four hundred and twenty five thousand pounds (£425,000) of the escrowed amount was released to us in December 2007 and we expect that the remaining £75,000 will be released to us in fiscal 2008. These two subsidiaries constituted our respiratory therapy division. Our respiratory therapy division supplied medical-grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to pharmacies in the U.K., oxygen concentrators to customers in Northern Ireland and oxygen services to customers in the South East of England. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, ‘‘ le="opacity:100; position:relative; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ’’ (‘‘FAS No. 144’’), we have accounted for our respiratory therapy division as a discontinued operation. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our respiratory therapy division for the current and prior periods are reported in discontinued operations on our statement of operations.    The NHS requires any healthcare staffing company that provides temporary staff to the NHS  hospitals in a region to enter into a Framework Agreement setting forth, among other things, applicable quality standards and maximum payment rates. The introduction and further extension of the NHS Framework Agreements has continued to impact our financial results by reducing our margins from that source of business. In addition, we have experienced reduced revenues from the NHS as a result of the NHS Framework Agreements, as well as from the efforts of the NHS to source more of its work from its own employee base and its in-house agency (NHS Professionals). The reduction in demand from the NHS for healthcare staffing services as a result of overspending by the NHS Trusts (the NHS operates its hospitals through NHS Trusts, each of which operates one or more hospitals) has also impacted our financial results.    Critical Accounting Policies    The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures in a given reporting period. We believe the following accounting policies are critical areas affecting our financial condition and results of operations where estimates are required.   22       Accounts Receivable    We are required to estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivables, which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current credit-worthiness of each customer. Significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future as we continue to expand our business and as conditions in the marketplace change.    Our company maintains credit controls to ensure cash collection on a timely basis. The credit terms agreed with our customers range from 7 days to a maximum of 30 days from invoice date. We maintain a credit department which consists of approximately 20 personnel who are targeted to collect outstanding receivables. We have established the following guidelines for the credit department to use as well as for us to assess the credit department’s performance:           •    to maintain average days sales outstanding to below 35 days;            •    to limit our overdues (greater than 90 days) within agreed targets; and            •    to limit bad debt write off in the year within agreed targets.     We also apply a policy of withdrawing supply from customers who are significantly overdue. Many private customers are contracted on a ‘‘direct debit’’ basis where we can collect payment direct from customers’ bank accounts.    We have devised a provisioning methodology based on the customer profile and historical credit risk across our U.K. business. Accounts receivable are written off when the credit control department determines the amount is no longer collectible. In addition, we do not have a threshold for account balance write-offs as our policy focuses on all balances, whatever the size.    Intangible Assets    We have significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in strategy and/or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill. We have recorded goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions through September 30, 2007. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A more frequent evaluation will be performed if indicators of impairment are present. We completed the annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill balance The calculation of fair value used for an impairment test includes a number of estimates and assumptions, including future income and cash flow projections, the identification of  appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate. If we are required to record an impairment charge in the future, it could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.    Deferred Income Taxes    We account for deferred income taxes based upon differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The determination of whether or not valuation allowances are required to be recorded involves significant estimates regarding the future profitability of our company, as well as potential tax strategies for the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.    Contingencies    We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.   23       Revenue Recognition    Patient services are recognized when services are performed and substantiated by proper documentation. For patient services, which are billed at fixed rates, revenue is recognized upon completion of timesheets that also require the signature of the recipient of services.    We receive a majority of our revenue from local governmental social services departments and the NHS.    Purchase Accounting    We account for our acquisitions as purchase business combinations. At acquisition, preliminary values and useful lives are allocated based upon fair values that have been determined for assets acquired and liabilities assumed and management’s best estimates for values that have not yet been finalized. We obtain a third-party valuation in order to complete our purchase price allocations. Accordingly, final asset and liability fair values as well as useful lives may differ from management’s original estimates and could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.    Results of Operations    Year Ended September 30, 2007 vs. Year Ended September 30, 2006    Revenues    Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2007 were $277.8 million compared to $280.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2006, a decrease of $2.4 million or 0.9%. This decrease was mainly due to a reduction in demand from the NHS as overspending by the NHS Trusts in other areas has forced significant reductions in agency spending as well as price pressures arising from the NHS Framework Agreements. Changes in foreign exchange had a favorable effect on revenue ($23.7 million).    Gross Profit    Total gross profit decreased by $1.7 million to $84.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 from $85.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2006, a decrease of 2.1%. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2007 slightly decreased to 30.2% from 30.6% for the comparable prior period mainly due to lower margins on the NHS Framework Agreements. Changes in foreign exchange had a favorable effect on gross profit ($7.2 million).    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.2 million to $75.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 from $71.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2006, an increase of 5.9%. This increase was mainly due to severance costs and related professional fees incurred upon the resignation of our chairman and chief executive officer ($1.2 million) and the issuance of new warrants and modification to extend the expiration date on warrants previously issued ($0.4 million). The increase was partially offset by lower overhead costs ($3.4 million). Changes in foreign exchange had an unfavorable effect on selling, general and administrative costs ($6.1 million).    Interest Income    Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2007 was $0.1 million compared to $0.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2006.   24       Interest Expense    Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2007 was $4.2 million compared to $2.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2006, which represents an increase of $1.3 million. This increase was principally attributable to the write-off of deferred financing fees ($0.7 million) and prepayment fees ($0.3 million) associated with the irrevocable written notice given to our lenders notifying them of our intent to prepay the outstanding amounts under our term loan A and term loan  B1 from the proceeds from the sale of our respiratory therapy division, as well as changes in foreign exchange of $0.6 million. This increase was partially offset by lower borrowings in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.    Other Income    Total other income for the year ended September 30, 2007 was $0.8 million, which represents the change in value of our interest rate swaps that had been designated as cash flow hedges and which were deemed to be ineffective at September 30, 2007.    Provision for Income Taxes    We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $2.1 million or 36.4% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2007, compared to a benefit of $1.9 million or 1.7% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2006. The difference in the effective tax rate between the year ended September 30, 2007 and the year ended September 30, 2006 is mainly due to non-deductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2006, permanent differences in the United Kingdom and change in the U.K. enacted rates.    Discontinued Operations    Discontinued operations resulted in income of $62.7 million for the year ended  September 30,  2007 compared to a loss of $17.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. On  September 30,  2007, we disposed of two of our U.K. subsidiaries when we sold the shares of Allied Respiratory Limited and Medigas Limited for £36.5 million ($74.7 million) in cash, of which £500,000 ($1.0 million) is being held back until certain conditions are met. Four hundred and twenty five thousand pounds (£425,000) of the escrowed amount was released to us in December 2007 and we expect that the remaining £75,000 will be relea sed to us in fiscal 2008. These two subsidiaries constituted our respiratory therapy division, which supplied medical- grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to pharmacies in the U.K., oxygen concentrators to customers in Northern Ireland and oxygen services to customers in the South East of England. Included in the $62.7 million income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2007 is the gain of $56.5 million, net of tax of $0 on the sale of our respiratory therapy division. Under U.K. tax legislation, enacted on April 1, 2002, disposals of shares by companies with substantial shareholdings does not result in a taxable gain transaction.    In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 144, we have accounted for our respiratory therapy division as a discontinued operation. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our respiratory therapy division for the current and prior periods are reported in discontinued operations on our statement of operations.   25       The following table presents the financial results for the discontinued operations (dollars in thousands).                            Year Ended September 30,         2007    2006    Revenues:                    Net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies     $  28,699      $  14,402     Cost of revenues:                    Respiratory, medical equipment and supplies      13,024       10,521     Impairment of respiratory, medical equipment and supplies      —       5,932    (b )        Total cost of revenues      13,024       16,453     Gross profit (loss)      15,675       (2,051  )        Selling, general and administrative expenses      6,091       4,449     Impairment of goodwill      —       11,897    (c )        Impairment of long-lived assets      —       257  (b )        Operating income (loss) from discontinued operations      9,584       (18,654  )        Interest income      2       2     Interest expense      (1,570  ) (d)          (1,410  ) (d)        Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income tax      8,016       (20,062  )        Gain on disposal of subsidiaries, net of tax      56,471       —     Provision for (benefit from) income taxes      1,750    (a )          (2,444  )        Income (loss) from discontinued operations     $  62,737      $  (17,618  )                         (a)  Included in the provision for income taxes for the year end September 30, 2007 is the reversal of $0.7 million of certain tax contingencies related to our fiscal 2003 discontinued operations on the sale of two of our U.S. subsidiaries as the statute of limitations has expired.      (b)  In the fourth of fiscal 2006, we recognized pre-tax charges of $5.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the write-off of revenue producing equipment (oxygen cylinders), oxygen filling station and software costs, respectively. Due to the award of the new oxygen contracts (see below), we had made significant capital expenditures, amounting to $14.7 million, in order to fulfill our obligation under the new contracts. We had substituted a number of cylinders with oxygen concentrators. As such, we believed that these oxygen cylinders had become obsolete and had no further use to us. We also invested in an oxygen filling station whereby our cylinders would be re-filled. But, due to the location of the plant and strict noise pollution governmental rules, we did not believe we would be able to utilize suc h plant. We also wrote-off various software costs related to transitioning to our new oxygen contracts that we believed had no future benefit.      (c)  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed our annual impairment test required under FAS No. 142 and determined there was an impairment to our recorded goodwill balance by using a combination of market multiple, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow methods. Based on a combination of factors, contributing to the impairment loss were the decrease in profits in our respiratory therapy division due to the transitioning from the old pharmacy based contracts to the new supply of oxygen direct to patients contracts that have lower margins (see below), our current market capitalization at time of review as well as the current and projected operating results. As such, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $11.9 million.      (d)  In fiscal 2007 and 2006, interest expense has been allocated to discontinued operations based on debt that we have specifically identified as being attributable to discontinued operations, as an allocation based on net assets would not provide a meaningful result. We based our allocation on the amount of capital expenditures directly related to our discontinued operations and then considered cash borrowings necessary to maintain the operations of our then respiratory therapy division. Prior to fiscal 2006, the respiratory therapy division was self-sufficient and borrowings were predominately used to fund acquisitions in our flexible healthcare staffing division.    26       In 2005, the U.K. Department of Health sought to unify the supply of oxygen to National Health Service patients in England and Wales. The previous system used pharmacies to supply cylindered gases, while oxygen concentrators were supplied via regional contracts with homecare providers. Under the revised system, which came into effect on February 1, 2006, homecare providers supply cylindered gas and liquid oxygen as well as oxygen concentrators directly to patients. Following a bidding process, we were awarded two of the contracts with the U.K. Department of Health, both of which commenced in February 2006 and both of which covered the South East of England. The contracts required the set up of additional facilities in the South East of England, which we effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and which resulted in our company incurring additional charges and capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 as we commenced supplying under the new contrac ts. Our supply of cylindered gases in Northern Ireland and Scotland was unaffected by the new contracts, as was our contract to supply oxygen concentrator services in Northern Ireland.    Net Income    As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of $66.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 compared to a net loss of $123.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2006.    Year Ended September 30, 2006 vs. Year Ended September 30, 2005    Revenues    Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2006 were $280.2 million compared to $342.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2005, a decrease of $61.8 million or 18.1%. This decrease was mainly due to a reduction in demand from the NHS as overspending by the NHS Trusts in other areas has forced significant reductions in agency spending as well as price pressures arising from the NHS Framework Agreements and unfavorable effects of changes in foreign exchange ($7.7 million).    Gross Profit    Total gross profit decreased by $13.0 million to $85.7 million for the year ended  September 30,  2006 from $98.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2005, a decrease of 13.2%. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign exchange accounted for $2.3 million of the decrease. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2006 increased to 30.6% from 28.9% for the comparable prior period, mainly du to management’s focus on supplying healthcare staff to our higher margin customers.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.9 million to $71.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 from $73.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2005, a decrease of 2.7%. This decrease was mainly due to a reduction in headcount and associated costs ($3.6 million) and changes in foreign exchange. The decrease was offset by increased level of costs in IT depreciation and maintenance costs arising from the new computerized accounting and payroll systems ($2.7 million) and stock-based compensation ($0.7 million).    Impairment of Goodwill    In accordance with FAS No. 142, ‘‘ Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ’’ (‘‘FAS No. 142’’), we completed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and determined there was an impairment to our recorded goodwill balance by using a combination of the market multiple, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow methods. Based on a combination of factors, contributing to the impairment loss were the decrease in profits due to the decline of revenues from the NHS, our market capitalization at the time of testing as well as current and projected operating results. As such, we recognized an impairment charge of $110.0 million.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets    In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we recognized a charge of $9.0 million of software costs related to our computerized accounting and payroll system that is based on the Oracle platform. We    27        have discovered that the system was too slow for the nature of our business and therefore was not achieving full functionality. As such, we decided to abandon certain of the software features of the Oracle platform and not continue with the planned expansion to our other branches as we believed the cost to have a workable model would exceed alternative solutions. We are currently in the process of comparing various operating systems in order to determine which system best supports our branch network and allows us to interface with our customers and communicate with our staff.    We also reviewed the carrying amount of our other intangibles and deemed certain assets to be impaired as of September 30, 2006 as a result of the decline in revenues from the NHS. Thus, in accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 144, we have recognized an impairment charge of $1.0 million.    Interest Income    Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2006 was $0.1 million compared to $0.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2005, which represents a decrease of $0.1 million. The decrease was attributable to a lower level of funds invested.    Interest Expense    Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2006 was $2.9 million compared to $4.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2005, which represents a decrease of $1.3 million. This decrease was principally attributable to interest expense of $1.4 million that has been allocated to discontinued operations in fiscal 2006 based on debt that the company has specifically identified as being attributable to discontinued operations, as an allocation based on net assets would not provide a meaningful result. We based our allocation on the amount of capital expenditures directly related to our discontinued operations and then considered cash borrowings necessary to maintain the operations of our then respiratory therapy division. Prior to fiscal 2006, the respiratory therapy division was self-sufficient and borrowings were predominately used to fund acquisitions in our flexible healthcare staffing division. As such, no a llocation of interest was required for fiscal 2005.    Provision for Income Taxes    We recorded a benefit from income taxes amounting to $1.9 million or 1.7% of loss before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2006, compared to a provision of $6.4 million or 30.1% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2005. The difference in the effective tax rate between the year ended  September 30,  2006 and the year ended September 30, 2005 is mainly due to non-deductible goodwill impairment charges.    Discontinued Operations    Discontinued operations resulted in a loss of $17.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 compared to income of $3.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. The increase in revenues in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was a result of the introduction of two new oxygen supply contracts that commenced on February 1, 2006, which also resulted in additional costs being incurred.   28       The following table presents the financial results for the discontinued operations (dollars in thousands).                            Year Ended September 30,         2006    2005    Revenues:                    Net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies     $  14,402      $  9,158     Cost of revenues:                    Respiratory, medical equipment and supplies      10,521       4,214     Impairment of respiratory, medical equipment and supplies      5,932    (a )          —     Total cost of revenues      16,453       4,214     Gross (loss) profit      (2,051  )          4,944     Selling, general and administrative expenses      4,449       897     Impairment of goodwill      11,897    (b )          —     Impairment of long-lived assets      257    (a )          —     Operating (loss) income from discontinued operations      (18,654  )          4,047     Interest income      2       —     Interest expense      (1,410  ) (c)          —    (c )        (Loss) income from discontinued operations before income tax      (20,062  )          4,047     (Benefit from) provision for income taxes      (2,444  )          280     (Loss) income from discontinued operations      $  (17,618  )         $  3,767                      (a)  In the fourth of fiscal 2006, we recognized pre-tax charges of $5.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the write-off of revenue producing equipment (oxygen cylinders), oxygen filling station and software costs, respectively. Due to the award of the new oxygen contracts, we had made significant capital expenditures, amounting to $14.7 million, in order to fulfill our obligation under the new contracts. We had substituted a number of cylinders with oxygen concentrators. As such, we believed that these oxygen cylinders had become obsolete and had no further use to us. We also invested in an oxygen filling station whereby our cylinders would be re-filled. But, due to the location of the plant and strict noise pollution governmental rules, we did not believe we would be able to utilize such plant. We  also wrote-off various software costs related to transitioning to our new oxygen contracts that we believed had no future benefit.      (b)  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed our annual impairment test required under FAS No. 142 and determined there was an impairment to our recorded goodwill. Based on a combination of factors, contributing to the impairment loss were the decrease in profits in our respiratory therapy division due to the transitioning from the old pharmacy based contracts to the new supply of oxygen direct to patients contracts that have lower margins (see below), our current market capitalization at time of review as well as the current and projected operating results. As such, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $11.9 million.      (c)  In fiscal 2006, interest expense has been allocated to discontinued operations based on debt that we have specifically identified as being attributable to discontinued operations, as an allocation based on net assets would not provide a meaningful result. We based our allocation on the amount of capital expenditures directly related to our discontinued operations and then considered cash borrowings necessary to maintain the operations of our then respiratory therapy division. Prior to fiscal 2006, the respiratory therapy division was self-sufficient and borrowings were predominately used to fund acquisitions in our flexible healthcare staffing division. As such, no allocation of interest was required for fiscal 2005.    29       Net Loss    As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net loss of $123.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 compared to net income of $18.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2005.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    General    For our fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, we generated $22.2 million from continuing operating activities. Cash requirements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 for capital expenditures ($1.3 million), payments for acquisition payables ($2.6 million), principal payments on the long-term debt portion of our Amended Senior Credit Facility (as such term is defined below) ($11.8 million), net payments on the revolving loan portion of our Amended Senior Credit Facility ($14.8 million) and payments for financing fees ($0.5 million) were met through operating cash flows, net borrowings under our Amended Senior Credit Facility and cash on hand.    We believe that the existing capital resources and those generated from operating activities and available under existing borrowing arrangements will be adequate to conduct our operations for the next twelve months.    Accounts Receivable    We maintain a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, $21.5 million (8.5%) and $26.8 million (13.7%), respectively, of our total assets consisted of accounts receivable. The decrease in accounts receivable from 2006 to 2007 is mainly due to strict targets being set and achieved by management on the recovery of overdue debts and cash collection, which in turn has yielded sustained cash flow benefits.    Our goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry average, which would tend to mitigate the risk of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. We maintain credit controls to ensure cash collection on a timely basis. Days sales outstanding (‘‘DSOs’’) is a measure of the average number of days we take to collect our accounts receivable, calculated from the date services are rendered. At September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, our average DSOs were 26 and 35, respectively.    At September 30, 2007 gross receivables were $23.6 million, of which $16.0 million or 67.6% were represented by amounts due from U.K. governmental bodies, either the NHS or local governmental social service departments (the ‘‘SSD’’). At September 30, 2006 gross receivables were $29.3 million, of which $19.7 million or 67.2% were represented by amounts due from U.K. governmental bodies. The remaining accounts receivable balance is due from commercial payors (nursing homes, private hospitals and pharmacies) and private payors.   30       The following table summarizes the accounts receivable aging by payor mix at September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 (dollars in thousands):                                               At September 30, 2007    0-30   Days    31-60    Days    61-90    Days    91-120   Days    121 Days   And Over    AR At   9/30/2007    NHS     $  4,394      $  1,210      $  337      $  151      $  211      $  6,303     SSD      7,907       1,125       370       246       21       9,669     Commercial Payors      3,326       1,028       116       25       73       4,568     Private Payors      1,734       472       140       88       638       3,072     Gross AR at 9/30/07     $  17,361      $  3,835      $  963      $  510      $  943      $  23,612     Less: Unapplied Cash                                                    Less: Surcharges (A)                                              (552  )        Less: Allowance For Doubtful Accounts                                              (1,570  )        Accounts Receivable, net                                             $  21,490                                                   At September 30, 2006    0-30   Days    31-60   Days    61-90   Days    91-120   Days    121 Days   And Over    AR At   9/30/2006    NHS     $  4,469      $  2,408      $  567      $  502      $  1,073      $  9,019     SSD      6,991       2,409       533       347       360       10,640     Commercial Payors      3,803       1,440       420       184       451       6,298     Private Payors      1,718       555       241       157       626       3,297     Gross AR at 9/30/06     $  16,981      $  6,812      $  1,761      $  1,190      $  2,510      $  29,254     Less: Surcharges (A)                               (738  )        Less: Allowance For Doubtful Accounts                               (1,703  )        Accounts Receivable, net                              $  26,813                      (A)  Surcharges represent interest charges to customers on overdue accounts. The surcharges are recognized in income only upon receipt of payment.     As discussed above under ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies — Accounts Receivable,’’ each fiscal year we undertake a review of our methodology and procedure for reserving for our doubtful accounts. This process also takes into account our actual experience of write offs in the period. The policy is then applied at each quarter end to arrive at a closing reserve for doubtful accounts. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we reviewed our current methodology and revised the basis of estimation for providing against certain classes of doubtful account receivable based on an analysis of historical experience. This review has given rise to a benefit of approximately $0.3 million on our fiscal 2006 statement of operations.    Given the high percentage of U.K. governmental debt, the large number of customer accounts with low-value debt within the remainder of the accounts receivable ledger and the methodology for making provisions for doubtful accounts, we believe our provisioning method is prudent and appropriate to our business.    We provide homecare aides and nurses on the basis of terms (payment due within 7 to 30 days of invoice) and prices (rate per hour) agreed to in advance with our customers. Time sheets are signed by clients for the work performed and then invoices are generated based on agreed billing rates. Consequently, there is no process for approval of invoices. Our credit control policies currently achieve an average collection of approximately 26 days from submission of invoices.    As our current operations are in the U.K. and the majority of accounts receivable is from U.K. governmental bodies for which payment terms and prices are agreed in advance, we have not recorded any contractual allowances. There have been recent agreements with the NHS to adjust rates (both increases and decreases) depending on the volume of hours utilized. Billing adjustments are    31        reviewed quarterly based on actual volumes delivered and any entries are recognized during the appropriate period. No material adjustments have arisen based on volumes delivered.    Borrowings    General    In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, our first tier U.K. subsidiary, Allied Healthcare Group Holdings Limited (‘‘Allied Holdings’’), obtained financing denominated in pounds sterling consisting of a £50 million multicurrency senior credit facility (the ‘‘Senior Credit Facility’’). As described in more detail below, in December 2006, the Senior Credit Facility was amended and restated (the ‘‘Amended Senior Credit Facility’’).    On December 12, 2006, our U.K. subsidiary, Allied Holdings, and our banks entered into the Amended Senior Credit Facility. The Amended Senior Credit Facility provided for a £46 ($94.2) million multicurrency senior credit facility to replace the Senior Credit Facility. The effective date of the Amended Senior Credit Facility was December 13, 2006. The Amended Senior Credit Facility was secured by a first priority lien on the assets of Allied Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries, and payment was guaranteed by Allied Healthcare International Inc. and certain of the subsidiaries of Allied Holdings. Allied Healthcare International Inc. granted the banks a security interest in substantially all of its assets to secure the payment of its guarantee.    The Amended Senior Credit Facility consisted of the following:           •    an £18 ($36.9) million term loan A, maturing in July 2009;            •    a £12.5 ($25.6) million revolving loan B1 maturing in July 2009 and that could be drawn upon until June 2009;            •    a £7.5 ($15.3) million invoice discounting facility B2 that matures in July 2009 and can be drawn upon until July 2009, and            •    an £8.0 ($16.4) million revolving loan C maturing in July 2009 and that could be drawn upon until June 2009.     Repayment of the term loan A was made semi-annually until final maturity. Repayment of the revolving loan B1 was made on the last day of its interest period. Repayment of the invoice discounting loan B2 shall be on the maturity date (July 2009). Repayment of revolving loan C was on its maturity date (July 2009) or, if earlier, the date that the other facilities are repaid. The loans bore interest at rates equal to LIBOR plus any bank mandatory costs (if applicable) plus 0.70% to 3.50% per annum (depending on our consolidated debt to consolidated profit ratios). As of September 30, 2007, we had outstanding borrowings of $24.6 million, $25.6 million and $4.6 million relating to term loan A, revolving loan B1 and invoice discounting loan B2, respectively, under the Amended Senior Credit Facility that bore interest at rates ranging from 7.69% to 8.79%.    The invoice discount facility commenced in January 2007 and provides, among other things, the following:           •    we can borrow on 85% of our approved flexible staffing accounts receivable, which excludes accounts receivable greater than 120 days, credit balances and reserves;            •    no one debtor can exceed 10% of the outstanding approved accounts receivable; and            •    accounts receivable relating to private individuals are not fundable.     Prior to the commencement of the invoice discount facility, we had a £7.5 million ($14.8 million) revolving loan B which was repaid upon commencement of the invoice discount facility.    On September 28, 2007 Allied Holdings gave irrevocable written notice to the agent for the banks under the Amended Senior Credit Facility that it wished to prepay the amounts outstanding under the term loan A of £12.0 million ($24.6 million) and term loan B1 of £12.5 million ($25.6 million) on October 1, 2007 from the proceeds of sale of our respiratory therapy division. Allied Holdings also    32        gave irrevocable written notice that it wished to cancel term loan A, term loan B1 and revolving loan C on October 1, 2007. On October 1, 2007 Allied Holdings prepaid the amounts outstanding under the term loan A and the term loan B1 facilities from the proceeds of sale of our respiratory therapy division. Allied Holdings also cancelled term loan A, term loan B1 and revolving loan C on October 1, 2007. The invoice discount facility continues to be available.    The Amended Senior Credit Facility agreement was based on the U.K.’s Loan Markets Association Multicurrency Term and Revolving Facilities agreement, which is a standard form designed to be commercially acceptable to the corporate lending market.    Subject to certain exceptions, the Amended Senior Credit Facility prohibited or restricted the following, among other things:           •    incurring liens and granting security interests in our assets or the assets of certain of our U.K. subsidiaries;            •    incurring additional indebtedness;            •    making certain fundamental corporate changes;            •    paying dividends (including the payment of dividends to our company by our subsidiaries);            •    making specified investments, acquisitions or disposals;            •    repurchasing shares; and            •    entering into certain transactions with affiliates.     The Amended Senior Credit Facility contained affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as cash flow to debt service, earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to interest expense, and net borrowings to earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). We were also obligated to ensure that the guarantors of the Amended Senior Credit Facility must not at any time represent less than 90% of the consolidated gross assets, turnover or earnings before interest and taxes of the U.K. subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2007, we were in compliance with such financial covenants.    The Amended Senior Credit Facility placed limits on our ability to incur capital expenditures, required us to separate the role of the chairman and the chief executive officer no later than August 1, 2007, and required us to engage a consultant to review our operations and make recommendations with respect thereto. In July 2007, the role of the chairman and chief executive officer was separated. We obtained an extension of time to February 1, 2008 to appoint a permanent chief executive officer.    In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Senior Credit Facility was amended to provide an overdraft facility (the ‘‘Overdraft Facility’’) in the amount of £3.0 ($5.6) million for general corporate purposes. We had utilized the Overdraft Facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and had no amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2007. The Overdraft Facility was repayable upon the earlier of demand from the bank or January 11, 2007. Interest on the Overdraft Facility was charged at the same rate as loans under revolving loan B1. In December 2006, the Overdraft Facility was rolled over and incorporated into our loan under the Amended Senior Credit Facility.    Notes Due in Connection with Acquisitions    We repaid, through Allied Holdings, notes payable of $1.9 million issued in connection with the acquisition of certain U.K. flexible staffing agencies in our 2005 fiscal year.    Guarantees    The Amended Senior Credit Facility is secured by a first priority lien on the assets of Allied Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries. Together with Allied Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries, our company is guaranteeing the debt and other obligations of certain wholly-owned U.K. subsidiaries under the Amended Senior Credit Facility. In connection with the execution of the Amended Senior    33        Credit Facility, we granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of its assets to secure the payment of its guarantee. At September 30, 2007 and September 30 2006, the amounts guaranteed, which approximate the amounts outstanding, totaled $54.8 million and $71.2 million, respectively.    Financial Instrument    See ‘‘Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Interest Rate Risk.’’    Commitments    Employment Agreements    See ‘‘Item 11 — Executive Compensation — Employment Agreements; Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.’’    Operating Leases    We have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space and equipment. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options.    Contractual Cash Obligations    As described under ‘‘Borrowings’’ and ‘‘Commitments — Operating Leases’’ above, the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2007 (dollars in thousands):                             Fiscal    Total Debt   Obligations    Total Lease   Obligations    Total   Obligations    2008     $  54,795      $  2,587      $  57,382     2009      —       1,831       1,831     2010      —       1,218       1,218     2011      —       724       724     2012      —       579       579     Thereafter      —       156       156           $  54,795      $  7,095      $  61,890        Lease obligations reflect future minimum rental commitments required under operating leases that have non-cancelable lease terms as of September 30, 2007. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options.    Miscellaneous    Treasury Shares    In January 2001, we initiated a stock repurchase program, whereby we may purchase up to approximately $1.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. In May 2003, we initiated a second stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may purchase up to an additional $3.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. As of September 30, 2007, we had acquired 407,700 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.3 million pursuant to our stock repurchase programs, which are reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007. In addition, as of September 30, 2007, we had acquired 177,055 shares of our company’s common stock for an aggregate value of $1.0 million from certain of our executive officers. Suc h shares were acquired in fiscal 2004 and delivered to us as payment on promissory notes issued by us to them.    Acquisitions    In fiscal 2006, we acquired the entire issued share capital of a home care training agency for approximately $0.8 million in cash and additional contingent cash consideration of up to $0.9 million    34        dependent upon (i) future earnings in fiscal 2006, (ii) providing a set minimum of training programs and (iii) the sellers continuing employment with our company until at least December 31, 2006. Of the $0.9 million contingent cash consideration, we have recognized compensation costs of $0.1 million, net of income tax, and $0.5 million, net of income tax, for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively, as the acquisition contract required the sellers to remain in employment with us until at least December 31, 2006 (the earnout period). In fiscal 2007, the contingent consideration was earned and paid.    In fiscal 2005, we acquired a total of 9 flexible staffing agencies for approximately $17.1 million in cash and $0.1 million in acquisition payable, which was paid in fiscal 2006. As of September 30, 2005, these transactions included provisions to pay additional amounts, payable in cash, of up to $9.7 million in contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entities. In fiscal 2006 a total of $6.3 million was earned and paid in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007. The remaining balance of contingent consideration was unearned and will not be required to be paid.    In fiscal 2006, we completed our purchase price allocation for our fiscal 2005 acquisitions. Accordingly, final tangible assets, separately identifiable intangible assets and liabilities were assigned values of approximately $5.9 million, $5.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, with the remaining portion of $9.2 million attributable to goodwill. As compared to the original valuations at acquisition, the final valuation resulted in a reclassification of $0.2 million from separately identifiable intangible assets to goodwill.    In fiscal 2005, we completed our purchase price allocation for our fiscal 2004 acquisitions. Accordingly, tangible assets, separately identifiable intangible assets and liabilities were assigned values of approximately $1.3 million, $3.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, with the remaining portion of $4.9 million attributable to goodwill. As compared to the original valuations at acquisition, the final valuation resulted in a reclassification of $0.8 million from goodwill to separately identifiable intangible assets.    The pro forma results of operations and related per share information for these acquisitions have not been presented as the amounts are considered immaterial.    Disposition    On September 30, 2007, we sold all of the shares of Allied Respiratory Limited to Air Liquide Limited. Allied Respiratory Limited and its subsidiary, Medigas Limited, constituted the respiratory therapy division of our company. The consideration for the sale was denominated in sterling and consisted of £36.5 million ($74.7 million), of which £500,000 ($1.0 million) is being held back until certain conditions are met. Four hundred and twenty five thousand pounds (£425,000) of the escrowed amount was released to us in December 2007 and we expect that the remaining £75,000 will be released to us in fiscal 2008.    In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 144, we have accounted for our respiratory therapy division as a discontinued operation. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our respiratory therapy division for the current and prior periods are reported in discontinued operations on our statement of operations.    See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 for a discussion and details of discontinued operations, including an analysis of the pro forma effects on our financial statements of the discontinued operations.    Litigation    See ‘‘Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.’’    Contingencies    Some of our inactive subsidiaries were Medicare Part B suppliers who submitted claims to the designated carrier who is the government’s claims processing administrator. From time to time, the carrier may request an audit of Medicare Part B claims on a prepayment or postpayment basis. If the    35        outcome of any audit results in a denial or a finding of an overpayment, then the affected subsidiary has appeal rights. Under postpayment audit procedures, the supplier generally pays the alleged overpayment and can pursue appeal rights for a refund of any paid overpayment incorrectly assessed against the supplier.    We believe that we have been in compliance, in all material respects, with the applicable provisions of federal laws and regulations and applicable state laws, together with all applicable laws and regulations of other countries in which we operate. Due to the broad and sometimes vague nature of these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that an enforcement action will not be brought against us, or that we will not be found to be in violation of one or more of these laws or regulations. At present, we cannot anticipate what impact, if any, administrative or judicial interpretations of applicable federal and state laws and the laws of other countries in which we operate may have on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.    We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities. We are vigorously defending our position in all such proceedings. We believe that these matters should not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.    Liabilities for loss contingencies, arising from claims, assessments, litigation and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated. Based on management’s best estimate of probable liability, we have accrued $1.0 million and $0.7 million for such costs at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.    Impact of Recent Accounting Standards    See ‘‘Recent Accounting Pronouncements’’ in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2007.    Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    Foreign Currency Exchange    We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results. Currently, we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposures.    The translation of the financial statement of our U.K. operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the fiscal 2007 period as compared to the fiscal 2006 average rate, the translation of our U.K. financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in increased revenues of $23.7 million, increased operating income of $1.1 million and increased income from continuing operations of $0.3 million. We estimate that a 10% change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar would have a $27.8 million, $1.3 million and $0.4 million impact on reported revenues, operating income and income from continuing operations, respectively.    Interest Rate Risk    Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our cash equivalents and our Amended Senior Credit Facility. Our cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments purchased with initial maturities of 90 days or less. To manage our exposure to interest rate changes related to our Amended Senior Credit Facility, we use interest rate swap agreements.    In March 2003, we entered into a Rate Cap and Floor Collar Agreement that capped our interest rate at LIBOR plus 5.50% and our interest floor at LIBOR plus 4.47%, subject to special provisions, on approximately $93.6 million of our floating rate debt under a contract that would have expired in March 2008. In February 2005, we sold this derivative instrument for approximately $0.1 million.    In February 2005, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements, which expire in July 2009, the objective of which is to protect us against the potential increase in interest rates on our floating    36        rate debt. The two interest rate swap agreements cover approximately $61.4 million of the our floating rate debt until January 2008 and then decrease by $6.1 million each six-month period, in order to reflect the amortizing effect of our floating rate debt, until the end of the interest rate swap agreements. The interest rate under the swap agreements is fixed at 4.935% and is payable semi-annually. In the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we designated the two interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, ‘‘ Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities ,’’ as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 and related implementation guidance, we calculated the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  to be an asset of $0.6 million at September 30, 2007 and an asset of $0.3 million at September 30, 2006. Prior to the cash flow hedge designation, changes in the value from period to period of the interest rate swap agreements was recorded as other expense or income, as appropriate. At September 30, 2007, the cash flow hedges were deemed to be ineffective as our company entered into an irrevocable agreement to prepay the amounts outstanding under our term loan A and term loan B1 and subsequently, on October 3, 2007, we sold the swaps. Thus, the cumulative amount in other comprehensive income and the change in value were recorded in other income and totaled $0.5 million, net of $0.2 million in income tax, in fiscal 2007. At September 30, 2006, the effective portion of the income on the interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges was $0.3 million, net of income tax, and was included in other comprehensive income. In fis cal 2006, we recognized other income of $27 thousand, net of $12 thousand of income tax, related to the cash flow hedge ineffectiveness.    Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
