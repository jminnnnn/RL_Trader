ITEM 7.       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND               RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.           The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in conjunction with the description of our business included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position.           This discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainty. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  GENERAL           We are one of the leading providers of healthcare staffing services, including nursing and ancillary services, to the U.K. healthcare industry. We operate a community-based network of over 100 branches, with the capacity to provide nurses, carers (known as home health aides in the U.S.) and specialized medical personnel to locations covering approximately 90% of the population of the United Kingdom. We provide healthcare staffing services to hospitals, local governmental authorities, nursing homes and private patients in the U.K. Through our U.K. operations, we also supply medical grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to the U.K. pharmacy market and to private patients in Northern Ireland.           Our U.S. operations, which are concentrated in New York and New Jersey, supply infusion therapy, respiratory therapy and home medical equipment and accounted for less than 10% of our revenues during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.           We previously provided specialty pharmaceutical and medical supplies. On October 3, 2000, we sold a substantial portion of the assets of our U.S. mail-order operations. In addition, on November 22, 2000, we sold Amcare, Ltd. ("Amcare"), a U.K. subsidiary.           On April 24, 2002, we entered into the Reorganization Agreement with two of our subsidiaries, Allied Healthcare (UK) and TWUK, and certain investors in such subsidiaries. Both the Reorganization Agreement and Reorganization were voted upon and approved at our company's annual meeting of shareholders on June 7, 2002 and the Reorganization closed on July 25, 2002.           In the Reorganization:           o        Holders of redeemable shares of TWUK exchanged their                   redeemable shares for shares of our common stock, using the                   net exercise method, and received either 0.1308 or 0.1657                   shares of our common stock per redeemable share (depending                   upon the exercise price of the redeemable share).           o        Holders of ordinary shares of TWUK exchanged their ordinary                   shares for shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio of                   2.867 TWUK ordinary shares for                                    31                       every one share of our common stock (which is the equivalent                   of 0.3488 shares of our common stock for every ordinary share                   of TWUK). This ratio of TWUK securities for our securities is                   referred to as the "Exchange Ratio."           o        All warrants held by the mezzanine lenders (the "Mezzanine                   Warrants") of TWUK that were issued in connection with the                   Refinancing of our U.K. operations in 1999 were exercised for                   an aggregate of 1,640,000 ordinary shares of TWUK. Each                   resulting ordinary share was exchanged for 0.3488 shares of                   our common stock.           o        Holders of the equity warrants of TWUK (the "Equity Warrants")                   that were issued in connection with the Refinancing of our                   U.K. operations in 1999 exercised their Equity Warrants                   through the tender of the Notes of Allied Healthcare (UK)                   (exclusive of accrued and unpaid PIK interest) and received an                   aggregate of 22,286,869 ordinary shares of TWUK. Each                   resulting ordinary share was exchanged for 0.3488 shares of                   our new Series A preferred stock.           o        Holders of accrued and unpaid interest owed in respect of the                   Notes issued by Allied Healthcare (UK) in the Refinancing of                   our U.K. operations in 1999 were issued funding notes (the                   "Loan Notes") by Allied Healthcare (UK) in the principal                   amount of the accrued and unpaid interest owed them through                   June 17, 2002, less amounts which are withheld from certain                   U.K. residents as withholding taxes, and the Loan Notes were                   in turn exchanged for shares of our common stock at the rate                   of 0.3488 shares for every(pound)2.00 of Loan Notes. Interest                   accrued on the Notes through June 17, 2002 (prior to the date                   on which the Reorganization was consummated) because the new                   shares of Series A preferred stock became entitled to receive                   dividends commencing on June 18, 2002. As of September 30,                   2002, 116,759 shares of our common stock had been issued in                   settlement of accrued interest on the Notes and an additional                   890,098 shares were issued in December 2002.           o        Lastly, the special voting share of TWUK held by Triumph                   Partners III, L.P. was exchanged for one ordinary share of                   TWUK. However, since conversion of this ordinary share at the                   Exchange Ratio would result in 0.3488 shares of our common                   stock being issued, it was agreed that, in the Reorganization,                   zero shares of our common stock would be issued in respect of                   the ordinary share into which the special voting share has                   been exchanged.           As a result of the Reorganization and other transactions, as fully described in Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we recognized certain charges. Such amounts were partially offset by a gain on the settlement of accrued and unpaid interest owed to the holders of the Notes of Allied Healthcare (UK) in exchange for new shares of our common stock.                                    32              Our revenue mix and payor mix is influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles. The following table shows the percentage of historical net revenues represented by each of our product lines:                                                            Year Ended            Year Ended             Year Ended                                                       September 30,          September 30,          September 30,                                                            2002                  2001                   2000                                                           ------                ------                 ------         Product Line Net patient services..........................            91.5%                  84.5%                  59.2% Net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales.........................................             3.7                    7.4                   32.2 Net infusion services.........................             4.8                    8.1                    8.6                                                           ------                ------                 ------               Total revenues..................           100.0%                 100.0%                 100.0%                                                          =======                ======                 ======             The increase in net patient services and the decrease in other product lines as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2002 as compared to 2001 is primarily due to growth in our U.K. flexible staffing business both organically and through our on-going nursing and care agency acquisition program.           The following table shows the historical payor mix for our total revenues for the periods presented:                                                             Year Ended            Year Ended             Year Ended                                                       September 30,          September 30,          September 30,                                                            2002                  2001                   2000                                                            ----                  ----                   ----         Payor U.K. National Health Service   and other U.K. Governmental   Payors......................................             63.3%                 54.7%                  43.6% Private payors................................             34.9                  41.6                   38.4 Medicare......................................               .9                   1.6                   14.7 Medicaid......................................               .9                   2.1                    3.3                                                           ------                ------                 ------               Total revenues..................            100.0%                100.0%                 100.0%                                                           ------                ------                 ------             The increase in NHS and other U.K. governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2002 as compared to 2001 is primarily due to the U.K. acquisitions, which derive the majority of their revenues from the NHS, and to organic growth in the core flexible staffing business. The decrease in Medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2001 as compared to 2000 is primarily due to our exiting the U.S. mail-order business. We believe that our payor mix in the future will be determined                                   33     primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and to a lesser extent, from shifts in existing business among payors.           We believe that a substantial portion of our revenues derived from private payors in the U.S. was subject to case management and managed care and that this relationship will continue in the future.           Our gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of our product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin.           At September 30, 2002, we had $127,398,000 of intangible assets (primarily goodwill) on our balance sheet compared to $109,426,000 at September 30, 2001. This represented 47.6% of total assets and 236.1% of total shareholders' equity at September 30, 2002 and 44.1% of total assets and 301.0% of total shareholders' equity at September 30, 2001. In accordance with the provisions of FAS 142, all existing and newly acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives were not subject to amortization in fiscal 2002. Amortization of intangibles for the year ended September 30, 2001 was $3,852,000 and $3,301,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to increase the amount of intangible assets on the balance sheet. On a pro forma basis, assuming our U.K. subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended September 30, 2000, amortization of intangibles would have been $4,065,000.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Accounts Receivable           We are required to estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivables, which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current credit-worthiness of each customer. Significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future as we continue to expand our business and as conditions in the marketplace change.  Intangible Assets           We have significant amounts of goodwill. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in strategy and/or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill.  Deferred Taxes           We account for deferred income taxes based upon differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The determination of whether or not valuation allowances are required to be recorded involves                                       34      significant estimates regarding the future profitability of our company, as well as potential tax strategies for the utilization of net loss and operating loss carry forwards.  Contingencies           Related to our acquisitions of flexible staffing agencies, we have entered into agreements to pay additional amounts, in cash, as contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of such acquired entities. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2002.           During the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.  Revenue Recognition           Patient services and infusion and respiratory therapy revenues are recognized when services are performed and are recorded net of estimated contractual adjustments based on agreements with third-party payors, where applicable. Revenues from the rental of home medical equipment (including respiratory equipment) are recognized over the rental period (typically on a month-to-month basis). Revenues from the sale of pharmaceuticals and supplies are recognized when products are shipped and are recorded at amounts expected to be paid by third-party payors.           We receive a majority of our revenue from third-party insurance companies, the NHS and other U.K. governmental payors, Medicare and Medicaid. The amount paid by third-party payors is dependent upon the benefits included in the patient's policy or as allowable amounts set by third-party payors. Certain revenues are subject to review by third-party payors, and adjustments, if any, are recorded when determined.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended September 30, 2002 vs. Year Ended September 30, 2001  Revenues - --------           Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2002 were $259,898,000 compared to $154,633,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001, an increase of $105,265,000 or 68.1% (65.0% excluding the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange). This increase relates primarily to the growth of our company's U.K. flexible staffing operations as a result of acquisitions, principally Staffing Enterprise Limited and Staffing (PSV) Limited (collectively "Staffing Enterprise") ($62,902,000), Crystalglen Limited (operating under the trade name "Nurses                                     35      Direct") ($13,136,000), and Balfor Medical ($5,642,000) with the remaining increase ($23,585,000) principally reflecting organic growth in the staffing operations.  Gross Profit - ------------           Total gross profit increased by $23,811,000 to $71,790,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 from $47,979,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001, an increase of 49.6% (46.9% excluding the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange). As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2002 decreased to 27.6% from 31.0% for the comparable prior period. Gross margins for patient services decreased (26.9% for the year ended September 30, 2002 versus 30.7% for the comparable prior period) principally due to an increase in the percentage of revenues derived from the staffing of nurses and other more highly paid professionals, which have lower margins than the historical carer business. In addition, U.K. regulatory changes, which extend the entitlement of holiday pay to temporary workers, served to reduce gross margins in the current year. Gross margins in the respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales increased (46.3% for the year ended September 30, 2002 versus 37.9% for the comparable prior period) mainly due to the sales mix. Gross margins for infusion services slightly decreased (26.7% for the year ended September 30, 2002 versus 28.4% for the comparable prior period) principally due to product sales mix.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses - --------------------------------------------           Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $5,771,000 to $47,036,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 from $41,265,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001, an increase of 14.0% (12.2% excluding the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange). The increase reflects $2,341,000 representing certain tax equalization bonuses paid to senior management for the reimbursement of income taxes incurred as a result of share issuances and the higher level of overhead costs in our U.K. operations due principally to acquisitions and internal growth. This increase was partially offset by the application of Financial Accounting Standards Board FAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("FAS 142"), effective October 1, 2001, whereby goodwill is no longer being amortized ($3,852,000). In addition, we incurred $3,883,000 of expenses in fiscal 2001 related to exiting our U.S. mail-order operations.  Non-Cash Stock-Based Compensation - ---------------------------------           We recorded a non-cash charge of $5,835,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 representing $4,216,000 for the issuance of shares of our common stock to senior management and $1,619,000 related to exchange of employees' redeemable shares (options) in TWUK for shares of our common stock, using the net exercise method in the Reorganization.  Transaction Expenses - --------------------           We recorded a net charge of $686,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 principally reflecting the write-off of non-capitalized costs incurred in connection with evaluating options to maximize the value of our ownership interest in our U.K. operations.                                     36     Losses due to Sale of Subsidiary - --------------------------------           For the year ended September 30, 2001, we recorded losses of $354,000 due to the sale of Amcare as a result of the completion of the transaction.  Interest Income - ---------------           Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2002 was $3,024,000 compared to $1,587,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001. The increase was attributable to a higher level of funds invested.  Interest Expense - ----------------           Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2002 was $16,496,000 compared to $10,120,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of average borrowings outstanding, as well as the write-off of $925,000 of deferred financing fees, per FAS 145, related to certain costs associated with our 1999 Refinancing.  Gain on Settlement of Paid in Kind Interest - -------------------------------------------           We recognized a gain of $5,143,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 on the settlement of accrued and unpaid interest owed to the holders of the Notes of Allied Healthcare (UK) in exchange for new shares of our common stock.  Provision for Income Taxes - --------------------------           We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $4,971,000 or 50.3% of income before income taxes and minority interest for the year ended September 30, 2002 versus a provision of $24,117,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001. The difference between the 50.3% effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2002 and the statutory tax rate is due to our recording of an additional valuation allowance for the tax benefit associated with the current year's U.S. operating loss.           We had been previously committed to implementing tax strategies that provided for the sale of appreciated assets, including a portion of our ownership interest in our U.K. subsidiary, to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the tax net operating losses prior to their expiration. While we believe we will eventually realize the value of our tax losses, current developments, including the continued expansion of our U.K. operations has increased the uncertainty as to both the execution of the original strategy and the appropriateness of a tax strategy which may not align with our current business strategy. These uncertainties have impaired our ability to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, a full valuation allowance for all remaining deferred tax assets was provided.                                     37     Minority Interest - -----------------           We reported a charge for minority interest of $120,000 in the year ended September 30, 2002 compared to a charge of $22,000 in the year ended September 30, 2001. The minority interest represented the 1,050,000 shares of class A1 common stock of TWUK issued as part of the Nightingale consideration. In the Reorganization we acquired these shares and the U.K. operations became wholly owned by our company.  Net Income - ----------           As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of $4,794,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002 compared to a loss of $26,612,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001.  Redeemable Preferred Dividend - -----------------------------           We accrued $941,000 of dividends in the year ended September 30, 2002 for the Series A preferred stock issued in connection with the Reorganization and accreted $75,000 of costs related to the issuance of our Series A preferred stock.  Year Ended September 30, 2001 vs. Year Ended September 30, 2000  Revenues - --------           Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2001 were $154,633,000 compared to $135,408,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000, an increase of $19,225,000, or 14.2%. This increase relates primarily to the change in accounting for our U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 ($28,847,000) and increased revenues in our U.K. nursing operations as a result of acquisitions and an increase in billable hours charged ($28,418,000). Our U.S. home healthcare operations also experienced an increase in revenues ($1,108,000) primarily due to an increase in the number of patients being serviced. These increases were partially offset by our exit from the U.S. mail-order operations effective October 2000 ($22,476,000) and to the sale of Amcare in November 2000 ($16,667,000).  Gross Profit - ------------           Total gross profit increased by $2,352,000 to $47,979,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001 from $45,627,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2001 decreased to 31.0% from 33.7% for the prior year. The decrease in gross margins is principally due to growth in our U.K. nursing operations and the closing of our U.S. mail-order operations, which realized historical gross margins in excess of 50%. Gross margins for patient services were essentially flat year over year (30.7% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 31% for the prior year). Gross margins in the respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales decreased slightly (37.9% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 40.3% for the prior year) principally due to the sale of Amcare in November 2000 and slightly increased for infusion services (28.4% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 27.6% for the prior year) principally due to product mix.                                     38     Selling, General and Administrative Expenses - --------------------------------------------           Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2001 were $41,265,000 compared to $49,041,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000. This represents a decrease in the current year of $7,776,000 or 15.9%. This decrease relates primarily to the decrease in the U.S. mail-order operations due to our decision to exit this business in September of 2000 ($15,946,000) and the sale of Amcare in November 2000 ($2,920,000). Partly offsetting this decrease is the change in accounting for our U.K. subsidiaries from the equity method to consolidation ($6,347,000) as well as higher levels of overhead costs in the U.K. operations principally due to acquisitions and to support internal growth ($5,016,000). Overhead costs in our U.S. corporate offices also decreased ($663,000) principally due to headcount reductions and other cost saving initiatives.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - -------------------------------           For the year ended September 30, 2000, we recorded a $15,073,000 charge related to the write-down of assets to their fair value for the U.S. mail-order operations and Amcare. (See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.)  Losses due to Sale of Subsidiary - --------------------------------           For the year ended September 30, 2001, we recorded losses of $354,000 due to the sale of Amcare as a result of the completion of the transaction.  Legal Settlements, Net - ----------------------           For the year ended September 30, 2000, we recorded a one-time charge of $10,082,000 related to a settlement with the federal government, which was offset by a $5,000,000 settlement with the Prior Owners. See "Item 3--Legal Proceedings."  Restructuring Charge - --------------------           For the year ended September 30, 2000, we recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge related to exiting and closing our U.S. mail-order operations. (See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001.)  Interest Income - ---------------           Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2001 was $1,587,000 compared to $1,443,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000. The increase was attributable to higher interest income earned ($84,000) on a higher level of funds invested and by the change in accounting for our U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 ($60,000).                                    39     Interest Expense - ----------------           Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2001 was $10,020,000 compared to $10,457,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000. The decrease was attributable to the change in accounting for our U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 ($308,000), as well as the write-off of $1,167,000 of deferred financing costs associated with the early extinguishment of borrowings under our former credit facility. Effective October 1, 2001 we adopted FAS 145 and accordingly reclassified the $1,167,000 to interest expense which was previously recorded as an extraordinary item in fiscal 2000. This decrease was partially offset by the higher level of average borrowings outstanding.  Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes - ------------------------------------           We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $24,117,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus a benefit of $7,756,000 or 22.9% of loss before income taxes, equity income, minority interest and extraordinary loss for the year ended September 30, 2000. The difference between the current year provision and the statutory tax rate resulted principally from the establishment of a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.           We had been previously committed to implementing tax strategies that provided for the sale of appreciated assets, including a portion of our ownership interest in our U.K. subsidiary, to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the tax net operating losses prior to their expiration. While we believe we will eventually realize the value of our tax losses, current developments, including the continued expansion of our U.K. operations has increased the uncertainty as to both the execution of the original strategy and the appropriateness of a tax strategy which may not align with our current business strategy. These uncertainties have impaired our ability to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance for all remaining deferred tax assets has been provided.  Equity in Income of and Interest Income Earned from U.K. Subsidiaries - ---------------------------------------------------------------------           Equity in income of our U.K. subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $319,000, which represents 100% of the net income of our U.K. subsidiaries for the first quarter of fiscal 2000. (See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.) Interest income earned from our U.K. subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $782,000 (net of tax provision of $421,000), which represents interest income on an intercompany loan, which was repaid on December 20, 1999, concurrent with the Refinancing. There was no equity in income of and interest income earned from U.K. subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2001 as we consolidated our U.K. subsidiaries in the current fiscal year.  Minority Interest - -----------------           We reported a charge for minority interest of $22,000 in the year ended September 30, 2001 compared to a benefit $70,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000. The minority interest represents the 1,050,000 shares of class A1 common stock of TWUK issued as part of the Nightingale consideration. (See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.)                                    40     Net Loss - --------           As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of $26,612,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001 compared to a loss of $24,944,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000.  Year Ended September 30, 2001 vs. Pro Forma Year Ended September 30, 2000           The following comparisons of year ended September 30, 2001 as compared to pro forma September 30, 2000 present the pro forma statement of operations data as if our U.K. subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended September 30, 2000.  Revenues - --------           Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2001 were $154,633,000 as compared to pro forma revenues of $164,255,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000, which represents a decrease of $9,622,000 or 5.9%. This decrease was primarily attributable to exiting the U.S. mail-order operations ($22,476,000) and the sale of Amcare ($16,667,000). The impact of exiting these businesses was substantially offset with increased revenues in our U.K. nursing operations ($28,418,000) as a result of acquisitions and an increase in the number of billable hours. The U.S. home healthcare operations also experienced an increase in revenues ($1,108,000) primarily due to an increase in the number of patients being serviced.  Gross Profit - ------------           Total gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2001 was $47,979,000 as compared to pro forma gross profit of $54,620,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2001 decreased to 31.0% from 33.3% pro forma for the prior year. The decrease in gross margins is principally due to growth in our U.K. nursing operations and the closing of our U.S. mail-order operations, which realized historical gross margins in excess of 50%. Gross margins for patient services were essentially flat year over year (30.7% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 31.3% pro forma for the prior year). Gross margins in the respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales decreased slightly (37.9% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 38.5% pro forma for the prior year) principally due to the sale of Amcare in November 2000 and slightly increased for infusion services (28.4% for the year ended September 30, 2001 versus 27.6% pro forma for the prior year) principally due to product mix.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses - --------------------------------------------           Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2001 were $41,265,000 as compared to pro forma $55,592,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000,                                     41      which represents a decrease of $14,327,000 or 25.8%. This decrease was primarily attributable to exiting the U.S. mail-order operations ($15,945,000) and the sale of Amcare ($2,920,000). This decrease was partly offset with increased costs principally in the U.K. operations due to acquisitions and to support internal growth ($5,016,000). Overhead costs in our U.S. corporate offices also decreased ($663,000) principally due to headcount reductions and other cost saving initiatives.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - -------------------------------           For the year ended September 30, 2000, we recorded a $15,073,000 charge related to the write-down of assets to their fair value for the U.S. mail-order operations and Amcare. (See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.)  Legal Settlements, Net - ----------------------           For the year ended September 30, 2000, we recorded a one-time charge of $10,082,000 related to a settlement with the federal government, which was offset by a $5,000,000 settlement with the Prior Owners. See "Item 3--Legal Proceedings."  Restructuring Charge - --------------------           For the year ended September 30, 2000, we recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge related to exiting and closing our U.S. mail-order operations. (See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.)  Interest Income - ---------------           Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2001 was $1,587,000 as compared to pro forma $1,503,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000, which represents an increase of $84,000. This increase was attributable to higher interest income earned on a higher level of funds invested.  Interest Expense - ----------------           Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2001 was $10,020,000 as compared to pro forma $10,765,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000, which represents a decrease of $745,000. This variance was primarily attributable to the write-off of $1,167,000 of deferred financing costs associated with the early extinguishment of borrowings under our former credit facility. Effective October 1, 2001 we adopted FAS 145 and accordingly reclassified the $1,167,000 to interest expense which was previously recorded as an extraordinary item in fiscal 2000. This decrease was partially offset by the higher level of borrowings outstanding.  Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes - ------------------------------------           We recorded a provision for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2001 of $24,117,000 versus a pro forma benefit of $6,663,000 or 21.0% of loss before income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2000. The difference between the current year provision and the statutory tax rate resulted principally from the establishment of a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.                                   42              We had been previously committed to implementing tax strategies that provided for the sale of appreciated assets, including a portion of our ownership interest in our U.K. subsidiary, to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the tax net operating losses prior to their expiration. While we believe we will eventually realize the value of our tax losses, current developments, including the continued expansion of our U.K. operations has increased the uncertainty as to both the execution of the original strategy and the appropriateness of a tax strategy which may not align with our current business strategy. These uncertainties have impaired our ability to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance for all remaining deferred tax assets has been provided.  Minority Interest - -----------------           We reported a charge for minority interest of $22,000 in the year ended September 30, 2001 compared to a benefit of $70,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000. The minority interest represents the 1,050,000 shares of class A1 common stock of TWUK issued as part of the Nightingale consideration. (See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.)  Net Loss - --------           As a result of the foregoing, we still would have reported a net loss of $26,612,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001 compared to pro forma $24,944,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  General           For the year ended September 30, 2002, we generated $9,206,000 from operating activities. Cash requirements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 were for capital expenditures ($3,713,000), payment on acquisition payable ($1,038,000), payments for acquisitions ($2,047,000), payment on long-term debt ($5,150,000), payments on notes payable ($4,575,000) and payments for financing fees and share issuance costs ($4,053,000). Such cash requirements were met through operating cash flows, proceeds from the issuance of stock and cash on hand.           On April 22, 2002, we issued 684,258 shares of common stock to Timothy M. Aitken, our chairman and chief executive officer, and 487,099 shares of common stock to Sarah L. Eames, our president and chief operating officer, as a bonus for, among other things, services rendered through the date of issuance. Simultaneously with this issuance, we entered into                                   43      agreements with Mr. Aitken and Ms. Eames in which we agreed to provide them (through cash bonuses and loans) with substantially all of the cash necessary for them to pay the income taxes that they are expected to incur as a result of the issuances. Pursuant to these agreements, we made a cash bonus payment to Mr. Aitken of $1,401,000 and loaned him $550,000 and made a cash bonus payment to Ms. Eames of $846,000 and loaned her $390,000. The loans, which have been issued on a recourse basis, provide for interest at the rate of 4.65% compounded annually. All outstanding principal and accrued interest will be due on the earlier of April 30, 2007 or the date on which the employee disposes of the common shares received in accordance with the agreements. As collateral for the loans the employees have pledged an aggregate of 1,155,000 fully vested non-qualified stock options held by the employees and any proceeds received from the sale of the underlying securities. In addition, pursuant to these agreements, TWUK agreed to indemnify Mr. Aitken and Ms. Eames for certain income tax liabilities that they may incur as a result of these share issuances, subject to a maximum aggregate amount of $1,000,000. These executive bonuses and loans were approved by our company's board of directors. We recognized an aggregate expense of $6,558,000 related to these transactions in the quarter ended June 30, 2002. See "Item 13--Certain Relationships and Related Transactions--Recent Issuances of Shares."           In addition, on April 22, 2002, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hyperion TWH Fund II LLC, Triumph Partners III, L.P. and Triumph III Investors, L.P pursuant to which we agreed to issue an aggregate of 750,000 shares of our common stock at a per share purchase price of $4.25 per share. Such shares were issued on April 30, 2002. We used the proceeds of these share issuances to fund the cash bonuses and loans to Mr. Aitken and Ms. Eames. See "Item 13--Certain Relationships and Related Transactions--Recent Issuances of Shares."           In January 2001, we initiated a stock repurchase program, whereby we may purchase up to approximately $1,000,000 of our outstanding common stock in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions. As of September 30, 2002, we had acquired 266,200 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $720,000, which are reflected as treasury stock in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2002. We intend to continue with our stock repurchase program during fiscal 2003.           We believe our existing capital resources and those generated from operating activities and available under existing borrowing arrangements will be adequate to conduct our operations for the next twelve months.  Restricted Cash           Restricted cash represents cash and cash equivalents, advanced under the Refinancing, available for payment of consideration for certain permitted acquisitions under the Senior Credit Facility, including the payment of contingent consideration for completed transactions.                                       44      Accounts Receivable           We maintain a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 2002 and September 30, 2001, $33,634,000 (12.5%) and $29,555,000 (11.9%), respectively, of our total assets consisted of accounts receivable. The increase in the accounts receivable from 2001 to 2002 is mainly due to revenue growth.           Our goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry average, which would tend to mitigate the risk of recurrence of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. Days sales outstanding ("DSOs") is a measure of the average number of days we take to collect our accounts receivable, calculated from the date services are rendered. At September 30, 2002 and September 30, 2001, our average DSOs were 42 and 60, respectively. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Staffing Enterprise as of September 27, 2001, DSOs as of September 30, 2001 were 44. The decrease in the DSOs was mainly due to timing of cash collections.  Borrowings  General - -------           On December 17, 1999, our U.K. subsidiaries, Allied Healthcare (UK) and TWUK, entered into the Refinancing, pursuant to which they obtained new financing denominated in pounds sterling. As of September 30, 2002, the Refinancing consisted of a $149,114,000 Senior Credit Facility, a $17,058,000 mezzanine loan (the "Mezzanine Loan") and $3,480,000 of PIK notes of Allied Healthcare (UK). (These amounts give effect to the amendment to the Senior Credit Facility on September 27, 2001 to increase the borrowings thereunder.)  Senior Credit Facility - ----------------------           The Senior Credit Facility consists of the following:           o        $43,719,000 term loan A, maturing December 17, 2005;           o        $19,518,000 acquisition term loan B, maturing                   December 17, 2006, which may be drawn upon during the first                   nine years following closing;           o        per the September 27, 2001 amendment, $78,070,000 term                   loan C, maturing June 30, 2007; and           o        $7,807,000 revolving facility, maturing December 17, 2005.           Repayment of the loans commenced on July 30, 2000 and continues until final maturity. The loans bear interest at rates equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% to 3.50% per annum. As of September 30, 2002, TWUK had outstanding borrowings of $109,767,000 under the Senior Credit Facility that bore interest at a rate of 6.25% to 7.50%.                                    45              Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Credit Facility prohibits or restricts the following:           o        the incurrence of liens;          o        the incurrence of indebtedness;          o        certain fundamental corporate changes;          o        dividends (including distributions to us);          o        the making of specified investments; and          o        certain transactions with affiliates.           In addition, the Senior Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as senior interest coverage, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, fixed charge coverage and minimum net worth.           The loans under the Senior Credit Facility are collateralized by, among other things, a lien on substantially all of TWUK's and its subsidiaries' assets, a pledge of TWUK's ownership interest in its subsidiaries and guaranties by TWUK's subsidiaries.  Mezzanine Loan and Mezzanine Warrants - -------------------------------------           The Mezzanine Loan is a term loan maturing December 17, 2007 and bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 7% per annum, where LIBOR plus 3.5% will be payable in cash, with the remaining interest being added to the principal amount of the loan. The Mezzanine Loan contains other terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in the Senior Credit Facility. The lenders of the Mezzanine Loan also received detachable mezzanine warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2% of the fully-diluted ordinary shares of TWUK (the "Mezzanine Warrants"). As of September 30, 2002, TWUK had outstanding borrowings under the Mezzanine Loan of $15,443,000, which bore interest at a rate of 11.0%.           The fair value of the Mezzanine Warrants ($2,476,000) issued to the mezzanine lenders has been recorded as a discount to the Mezzanine Loan and is being amortized over the term of the loan using the interest method. In the Reorganization, the Mezzanine Warrants were exercised for an aggregate exercise price of $129,000 and the ordinary shares of TWUK received upon such exercise were exchanged at the Exchange Ratio for an aggregate of 572,032 shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the Reorganization Agreement.  Senior Subordinated Promissory Notes and Equity Warrants - --------------------------------------------------------           The Notes consisted of an aggregate of $35,051,000 principal amount of senior subordinated promissory notes of Allied Healthcare (UK) purchased by several institutional investors and certain members of management (collectively, the "Investors"), plus Equity Warrants issued by TWUK concurrently with the sale of the Notes. The Equity Warrants were                                    46     exercisable for ordinary shares of TWUK ("Warrant Shares"). The Warrant Shares represented, in the aggregate, approximately 27.0% of the fully-diluted ordinary shares of TWUK.           The Notes bore interest at the rate of 9.375% per annum, payable quarterly in cash subject to restrictions contained in the Senior Credit Facility requiring Allied Healthcare (UK) to pay interest in-kind through the issuance of PIK notes for the first 18 months, with payment of interest in cash thereafter subject to a fixed charge coverage test (provided that whenever interest cannot be paid in cash, additional PIK notes shall be issued as payment in-kind of such interest).           In the Reorganization, all of the outstanding Notes (in the aggregate principal amount of (pound)22,286,869) were surrendered in payment of the exercise price of the Equity Warrants. In the Reorganization, the Equity Warrants were exercised and each resulting Warrant Share of TWUK was exchanged at the Exchange Ratio for an aggregate of 7,773,660 shares of our Series A preferred stock. For a description of our shares of Series A preferred stock, see "Item 5--Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters."           In addition, in the Reorganization, accrued and unpaid PIK interest on the Notes in the amount of $9,138,000 ((pound)5,810,204), less $58,000 ((pound)37,020) that we withheld as withholding taxes (or a net amount of $9,080,000 ((pound)5,773,264)), was exchanged for shares of our common stock or the right to receive a funding note, which funding note is exchangeable for shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2002, 116,759 shares of our common stock had been issued in settlement of accrued interest on the Notes and an additional 890,098 shares of our common stock were issued in fiscal 2003.           All of the ordinary shares of Allied Healthcare (UK) that we own and all of the ordinary shares of TWUK owned by Allied Healthcare (UK) are held in a voting trust. The trustee of the voting trust is G. Richard Green, a director of our company. Prior to the consummation of the Reorganization, the shares were held in the voting trust for the benefit of the holders of the ordinary shares of TWUK (some of which were held by persons other than Allied Healthcare (UK)) and the holders of the Equity Warrants. In the Reorganization, the voting trust was amended to provide, among other things, that, in the event of a breach of our company of our obligation to redeem the shares of Series A preferred stock, the trustee will be obligated to vote and sell the shares held in the voting trust as directed by Triumph Partners III, L.P.  Notes Due in Connection with Acquisitions - -----------------------------------------           At September 30, 2002, we had, through TWUK, outstanding notes payable of $19,840,000, net of $597,000 of unamortized discount, issued in connection with the acquisition of certain U.K. flexible staffing agencies. The notes payable are secured by our senior credit lender which requires us to keep an amount on deposit for the sole purpose of repaying the notes payable. These notes bear interest at rates ranging from 2.99% to 5.50%. In general, we may not redeem the notes on or before three years after the date of issuance; however, such notes may be redeemed by the holder within one year from the first interest payment due date upon giving not less than sixty days written notice. Accordingly, the notes and related cash restricted to the payment of such notes have been classified as current in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheet included in our financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.                                   47    Commitments  Acquisition Agreements - ----------------------           Related to our acquisitions of flexible staffing agencies, we have entered into agreements to pay additional amounts, payable in cash, of up to $38,240,000, at September 30, 2002, in contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of such acquired entities.           In addition, we may have to pay up to (pound)8,560,000 in contingent consideration to the sellers of Medic-One Group Limited, which we acquired in November 2002. The contingent consideration, if any, will be satisfied by a combination of cash and shares of our common stock.  Employment Agreements - ---------------------           We have three employment agreements with certain executive officers (our chief executive officer, our chief operating officer and our chief financial officer) that provide for minimum aggregate annual compensation of $1,055,000 in fiscal 2002. The agreements contain, among other things, customary confidentiality and termination provisions and provide that in the event of the termination of the executive following a "change of control" of our company (as defined in such agreements), or a significant change in their responsibilities, such person will be entitled to receive a cash payment of up to 2.9 times their average annual base salary during the preceding 12 months (in the case of our chief executive officer and our chief operating officer) or one times his base salary (in the case of our chief financial officer).  Operating Leases - ----------------           We have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space and equipment. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options with extension dates in fiscal 2008 and 2013.  Contractual Cash Obligations           As described under "Borrowings," "Acquisition Agreements," and "Operating Leases" above, the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2002:                                   Total Debt         Total Lease      Total Other          Total Fiscal                       Obligations         Obligations      Obligations       Obligations - -------------------     -------------------------------------------------------------------------           2003                         29,569,000          1,756,000        38,240,000        69,565,000 2004                          8,744,000          1,307,000                          10,051,000 2005                         10,930,000          1,175,000                          12,105,000 2006                         28,886,000          1,097,000                          29,983,000 2007                         54,649,000            981,000                          55,630,000 Thereafter                   15,752,000          2,379,000                          18,131,000                         ------------------------------------------------------------------------                            $148,530,000         $8,695,000       $38,240,000      $195,465,000                         ========================================================================                                         48          Other obligations do not reflect any potential redemption of our Series A preferred stock or any tax indemnification we may be required to make to either Mr. Aitken or Ms. Eames. See "Item 13--Certain Relationships and Related Transactions--Recent Issuances of Shares."           Lease obligations reflect future minimum rental commitments required under operating leases that have non-cancelable lease terms as of September 30, 2002.  Miscellaneous  Acquisitions - ------------           During fiscal 2002 we acquired, through TWUK, a total of six flexible staffing agencies for approximately $2,184,000 in cash. The transactions include provisions to pay additional amounts, payable in cash, of up to $5,606,000 in contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entities.           On September 27, 2001, we acquired, through TWUK, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Staffing Enterprise, a London based provider of flexible staffing of specialist nurses and other healthcare professionals to London NHS Trust and independent hospitals. The consideration included $7,100,000 in cash, $14,800,000 in demand notes plus an additional sum of up to approximately $30,800,000 in contingent consideration dependent upon pre-tax profits for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.           In addition to the acquisition of Staffing Enterprise, during fiscal 2001 we acquired, through TWUK, a total of eleven other flexible staffing agencies for approximately $9,100,000 in cash and the issuance of $5,700,000 in demand notes. The transactions include provisions to pay additional amounts, payable in cash, of up to $13,000,000 in contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of the acquired entities.  U.S. mail-order operations - --------------------------           In September 2000, we approved a plan to exit our U.S. mail-order operations and effective October 3, 2000 sold certain assets of the U.S. mail-order operations located in Jacksonville, Florida. In addition, we recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 representing the estimated costs related to exiting and closing our U.S. mail-order operations. Based upon additional information and revised cost benefit estimates, we recorded an additional charge of $1,900,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 to reflect the write-down of the remaining accounts receivable to their estimated net realizable value. In addition to the write-down, we incurred operating expenses of $1,983,000 during the year ended September 30, 2002 in connection with closing our U.S. mail-order operations. In fiscal 2002, we recognized income of $280,000, representing the difference between estimated and actual costs to close and exit the business.  Disposition of Amcare - ---------------------           On November 22, 2000, we sold, through TWUK, Amcare for approximately $13,826,000 in cash. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we recorded a charge for impairment                                  49     of long-lived assets of approximately $2,727,000 to reflect the write-down of the carrying value of goodwill, originally acquired with the purchase of Amcare, to its fair value as well as a tax charge of approximately $1,654,000 to reflect the tax effect of the transaction. As a result of the completion of the transaction, we recorded additional losses of $354,000 and realized a foreign exchange loss of $391,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2000.  Contingencies - -------------           Some of our subsidiaries are Medicare Part B suppliers who submit claims to the designated carrier who is the government's claims processing administrator. From time to time, the carrier may request an audit of Medicare Part B claims on a prepayment or postpayment basis. Currently, some of our subsidiaries have pending audits. If the outcome of any audit results in a denial or a finding of an overpayment, then the affected subsidiary has appeal rights. Some of the subsidiaries currently are responding to these audits and pursuing appeal rights in certain circumstances.  Litigation - ----------           See "Item 3--Legal Proceedings."  Impact of Recent Accounting Standards - -------------------------------------           In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS 142. The provisions of FAS 142 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under FAS 142, all existing and newly acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests. Effective October 1, 2001, we adopted FAS 142 and suspended the amortization of goodwill. In accordance with the transitional provisions of FAS 142, previously recognized goodwill was tested for impairment. We completed the annual impairment test required by FAS 142 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and determined that there was no impairment to our recorded goodwill balance.           In October 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets." FAS No. 144 supersedes FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-lived Assets to be Disposed Of", and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.           In April 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4 (Reporting Gains and Losses From Extinguishment of Debt), 44 (Accounting for Intangible assets of Motor Carries), and 64 (Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements), Amendment of FASB Statement No.13 (Accounting for Leases), and Technical Corrections." FAS No. 145 addresses gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt and sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. We adopted FAS 145, effective October 1, 2001, and we                                50    recorded a charge of $925,000 in interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2002. We also reclassified $1,167,000 to interest expense which was previously recorded as an extraordinary item in fiscal 2000.           In June 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." FAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." This statement is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 15, 2002. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Inflation - ---------           Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations to date.   ITEM 7A.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE           We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results. Our primary exposure relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in the U.K. where the principal currency is pounds sterling and to the pounds sterling debt denominated obligations. See "Interest Rate Risk" below for debt obligations principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Currently, we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposures.  INTEREST RATE RISK           Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our cash equivalents and our U.K. subsidiaries' December 17, 1999 Refinancing which includes the Senior Credit Facility and Mezzanine Loan. Our cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments purchased with initial maturities of 90 days or less. We are subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for our variable rate Senior Credit Facility, Mezzanine Loan and cash equivalents. In accordance with provisions of the Refinancing, on January 25, 2000, we hedged the interest rate (LIBOR cap of 9%) on approximately $41,935,000 of our floating rate debt in a contract which expires December 31, 2003. The approximate notional amount of the contract adjusts down (consistent with debt maturity) to $30,378,000 as December 31, 2002.           As of September 30, 2002, our Series A preferred stock ($32,254,000) and PIK notes ($3,480,000) mature on December 31, 2008 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 9.375%. In addition, we had notes payable of $19,840,000, net of $597,000 debt discount, which were issued in connection with the acquisition of several U.K. flexible staffing agencies. The notes payable are redeemable, at the holder's option, in fiscal 2003 and bear interest ranging from 2.99% to                                         51   5.50% at September 30, 2002. The table below represents the expected maturity of our variable rate debt and their weighted average interest rates at September 30, 2002.
