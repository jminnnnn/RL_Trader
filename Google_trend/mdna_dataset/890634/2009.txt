Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    General     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in conjunction with the description of our business included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position. This discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainty. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Forward-Looking Statements.   We are a leading provider of flexible, or temporary, healthcare staffing services to the healthcare and social care industry in the United Kingdom, as measured by revenues, market share and number of staff. Our flexible healthcare staffing service provides personal or basic care and nursing services in the customers own homes, public or private hospitals and nursing and care homes. Homecare staffing, which accounts for over 80% of our healthcare staffing services, is provided for individuals (normally elderly individuals) who require domiciliary care, individuals with learning disabilities and individuals of all ages who require health-related services for complex care needs. The main purchaser of our services for customers own homes is local governmental social services departments, private individuals and National Health Services (the NHS) Primary Care Trusts. We also supply nursing staff services to nursing homes and hospitals that account for our remaining healthcare staffing services.   The services provided by us are provided by our integrated network of approximately 110 branches, which are located throughout most of the U.K. Our healthcare staff consists principally of homecare aides (known as carers in the U.K.), nurses and nurses aides. Our management evaluates operating results on a branch basis. All our branches are aggregated into one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes.   For a discussion of recently-enacted changes in VAT that may affect us, see Item 1ARisk FactorsRecently-enacted changes in VAT could affect our revenues or profit margins.   A further legislative change, which went into effect in April 2009, has increased the number of holiday pay entitlement for our flexible healthcare staff from 24 to 28 days per annum.   We are aware of legislative changes which will go into effect in fiscal 2011 that would disallow the U.K. tax deduction on intra-group interest expense. We are currently evaluating our intra-group position and the likely impact of this change on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.     - 29 -         The provisions of the Pensions Act 2008 relating to personal accounts were enacted to address the U.K. governments concerns that many U.K. workers are not saving enough for retirement. The Pensions Act 2008 will require employers to automatically enroll all eligible jobholders, who are not already in a qualifying workplace or personal pension plan, into either a qualifying workplace or personal pension plan or a new type of savings arrangement, known as the personal accounts plan. Automatic enrollment means that if jobholders do not wish to be a member of the plan offered to them they must actively opt out of that arrangement. Upon the phase in of the legislation, employers will be required to contribute a minimum of 3% of the jobholders qualifying earnings, which will be supplemented by contributions from the jobholder so that, in total, the pension contribution for each jobholder should equal a minimum of 8% of the jobholders qualifying earnings. There will be limits set on the amount that employers and jobholders can contribute in any one year. The personal accounts plan will be a new trust-based occupational plan, which is independent of the U.K. government and run by a Trustee Corporation. The current U.K. government plan is to introduce these new requirements in 2012. However, the U.K. government may defer the 2012 date and it is expected that the legislation will be phased in over a number of years. The extent to which we can recover this additional cost from our customers is uncertain and could impact our profit margins.   Critical Accounting Policies     The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures in a given reporting period. We believe the following accounting policies are critical areas affecting our financial condition and results of operations where estimates are required.   Accounts Receivable     We are required to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivables, which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current credit-worthiness of each customer. Significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future as we continue to expand our business and as conditions in the marketplace change.   Our company maintains credit controls to ensure cash collection on a timely basis. The credit terms agreed with our customers range from 7 days to a maximum of 30 days from invoice date. We maintain a credit department which consists of approximately 20 personnel who are targeted to collect outstanding receivables. We have established the following guidelines for the credit department to use as well as for us to assess the credit departments performance:                      to maintain average days sales outstanding (including unbilled accounts receivable) to below 45 days;                          to limit our overdues (greater than 90 days) within agreed targets; and                          to limit bad debt write off in the year within agreed targets.         - 30 -               We also apply a policy of withdrawing supply from customers who are significantly overdue. Many private customers are contracted on a direct debit basis where we can collect payment direct from customers bank accounts.   We have devised a provisioning methodology based on the customer profile and historical credit risk across our U.K. business. Accounts receivable are written off when the credit control department determines the amount is no longer collectible. In addition, we do not have a threshold for account balance write-offs as our policy focuses on all balances, whatever the size.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets     We have significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in strategy and/or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill. We have recorded goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions through September 30, 2009. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A more frequent evaluation is performed if indicators of impairment are present. We completed the annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill balance. The calculation of fair value used for an impairment test includes a number of estimates and assumptions, including future income and cash flow projections, the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate. If we are required to record an impairment charge in the future, it could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   Income Taxes     We account for income taxes using the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect tax carryforwards and the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes, as determined under currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recorded if future realization is more likely than not. Deferred taxes are recorded primarily for bad debts, federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, and depreciation and amortization of intangibles, which are reported in different periods for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The determination of whether or not valuation allowances are required to be recorded involves significant estimates regarding the future profitability of our company, as well as potential tax strategies for the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.   We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of September 30, 2009, our company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits, which remains unchanged from September 30, 2008.     - 31 -         Contingencies     We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.   Revenue Recognition     Patient services are recognized when services are performed and substantiated by proper documentation. For patient services, which are billed at fixed rates, revenue is mainly recognized upon the completion of timesheets that also require the signature of the recipient of our services and through electronic call monitoring.   We receive a majority of our revenue from local governmental social services departments and the NHS. For the years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, 75%, 69.0% and 63.5%, respectively, of our net revenues were attributable to local governmental social service departments and the NHS payor program.   Purchase Accounting     We account for our acquisitions as purchase business combinations. At acquisition, preliminary values and useful lives are allocated based upon fair values that have been determined for assets acquired and liabilities assumed and managements best estimates for values that have not yet been finalized. We obtain a third-party valuation in order to complete our purchase price allocations. Accordingly, final asset and liability fair values as well as useful lives may differ from managements original estimates and could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   Results of Operations     Overview     We are one of the larger suppliers of homecare services in the U.K. Current trends in homecare services that have contributed to the growth of this business include the increasing shift from care in residential homes to care in the home, which in most cases is a lower cost option, a move toward supplier consolidation by the local governmental authorities, an increase in the aging population and additional opportunities as a result of the increase in demand for higher sophisticated homecare service lines, such as continuing care and care for individuals with learning disabilities.     - 32 -         Nursing homes results have been impacted by the general economic market as well as the decision by one of our major customers to utilize, from April 2008, other service providers in addition to our company. We have experienced a lesser demand for our services from nursing homes, which we believe is a result of the economic recession, as nursing homes are trying to reduce their costs as well as their own permanent staff working additional hours.   The NHS requires any healthcare staffing company that provides temporary staff to NHS Hospitals in a region to enter into a Framework Agreement setting forth, among other things, applicable quality standards and maximum payment rates. The NHS Framework Agreements have impacted our financial results by reducing our margins from this source of business and making it very difficult to recruit nurses to work on these contracts at the stipulated pay rates. This has been somewhat offset by the increase in private hospital business which have higher profit margins. Management currently believes that the biggest decline in hospital staffing arising from the NHS Framework Agreements has occurred over our previous two fiscal years and such decline has now stabilized although it does fluctuate between quarters.   In fiscal 2009, the old Framework Agreements between the NHS and healthcare staffing companies entered the formal re-tender stage. In July 2009, we were notified that we had been successfully awarded, subject to contract completion, a new Framework Agreement. Our new Framework Agreement, which came into operation in October 2009, is at higher margins than our old Framework Agreement. We believe that the higher charges under our new Framework Agreement will give us opportunities going forward and we currently have plans to re-launch this service to provide healthcare staffing services to hospitals in a few of our regional offices as well as our existing London operation starting in fiscal 2010. However, we currently cannot determine the impact of our new Framework Agreement on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.   In some instances, a number of NHS Hospitals have elected to opt out of the old Framework Agreement and seek suppliers off framework for their temporary staffing needs mainly because the old charge and pay rates were not sustainable in recruiting sufficient staff to meet their requirements. The new framework agreements, with their higher charge and pay rates, are intended to bring those NHS Hospitals back onto using the framework rates. Whether this is achieved or not is still too early to determine and if it is not, there is a risk that the Framework Agreement may not be adhered to in certain areas. In the latter case, we will have to contract directly with the purchaser at separately negotiated rates.     - 33 -         Year Ended September 30, 2009 vs. Year Ended September 30, 2008     To provide an increased understanding of our companys business we are providing a breakdown of our revenues, gross profits, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs and operating income at constant exchange rates using the comparable prior period weighted average exchange rate. As reflected in the reported numbers, recent fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have significantly impacted our year ended September 30, 2009 results.

                    In addition to disclosing results of operations that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the chart above shows non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of foreign exchange on our current period results. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding our companys results of operations, as these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The chart also provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures.   Revenues     Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2009, before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, increased by $19.1 million, or 6.4%, to $317.7 million, compared with $298.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. Contributing to the increase in revenues was homecare revenues which grew by 15.0% to $259.3 million. Nursing home revenues declined by 21.4% to $32.9 million. Hospitals revenues decreased by 18.4% to $25.5 million. After the unfavorable impact of currency exchange of $67.9 million, revenues decreased to $249.8 million.   Gross Profit     Gross profit, before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, increased 7.4% to $97.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 from $90.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. Changes in foreign exchange decreased gross profit by $20.8 million to $76.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 compared to gross profit of $90.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2008, a decrease of 15.5%. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2009 was 30.6%, as compared to 30.3% for the comparable prior period mainly due to our sales mix. We remain focused on supplying healthcare staffing services to our higher-margin homecare customers.     - 34 -         Selling, General and Administrative Expenses     Total SG&A expenses for the year ended September 30, 2009, before the favorable impact of foreign exchange, was $79.6 million compared to $77.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. While current period SG&A running costs of 25.3% of revenues are lower than the prior year period of 26.0%, we are continuing to invest in certain areas of our business that includes such items as continuing care, learning disabilities, IT systems, and business improvement projects to ensure that we support future growth in revenues. At the same time, we maintain tight controls over other areas of SG&A costs so as to maintain our objective of reducing SG&A costs as a percent of revenues. The increase in SG&A costs is mainly related to the opening of new branches, investment in specialized service lines which include continuing care and learning disabilities, and costs associated with process improvements including the roll out of our new IT system. This increase was partially offset by additional net receipts of currently available government grants for training support of $0.6 million as compared to the prior year. We aim to ensure that we maintain any growth in SG&A costs to a lower degree than growth in our revenues. Changes in foreign exchange decreased the reported result by $16.4 million to $63.2 million compared to $77.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2008.   Interest Income     Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2009 was $0.5 million compared to $0.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. Even though we had higher cash balances, interest income was negatively impacted by the decrease in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange ($0.1 million).   Provision for Income Taxes     We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $3.4 million or 25.5% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2009, compared to a provision of $3.8 million or 29.9% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2008. The difference in the effective tax rate between the year ended September 30, 2009 and the year ended September 30, 2008 is mainly due to the utilization of loss carry forwards in the U.S. for which no benefit had been previously recorded, permanent differences and change in enacted rate in the U.K.   Discontinued Operations     In fiscal 2007, we disposed of two of our U.K. subsidiaries when we sold the shares of Allied Respiratory Limited and Medigas Limited. These two subsidiaries constituted our respiratory therapy division, which supplied medical-grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to pharmacies in the U.K., oxygen concentrators to customers in Northern Ireland and oxygen services to customers in the South East of England. We have accounted for our respiratory therapy segment as a discontinued operation.   In the year ended September 30, 2009, discontinued operations resulted in income, net of tax, of $0.4 million due to the reversal of accrued refunds payable and accrued patient electric usage reimbursement as the warranty period under the sales agreement covering these costs has expired.      - 35 -         Net Income     As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of $10.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 compared to net income of $8.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2008.

The chart also provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures.   Revenues     Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2008, before the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, increased $20.2 million, or 7.3% to $298.0 million compared to $277.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2007. Contributing to the increase in revenues was homecare revenues, which grew by 12.7% to $225.0 million. Nursing home revenues achieved 3.5% growth in revenue totaling $41.8 million. Due to the NHS Framework Agreements and NHS Professionals, as well as overspending by NHS Hospitals, hospitals revenues declined 17.5% to $31.2 million. Changes in foreign exchange increased the reported result by $0.6 million to $298.6 million compared to $277.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2007, an increase of $20.8 million or 7.5%.   Gross Profit     Gross profit, before the favorable impact of foreign exchange, increased 7.4% to $90.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2008 from $84.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2007. Changes in foreign exchange increased gross profit by $0.2 million to $90.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2008 compared to $84.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2007, an increase of 7.7%. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2008 was 30.3%, as compared to 30.2% for the comparable prior period. Gross profit margin for the year ended September 30, 2008 improved slightly due to the change in the mix of the business as a result of the overall growth in our homecare staffing services which typically operates at higher margins.     - 36 -         Selling, General and Administrative Expenses     Total SG&A expenses increased by $2.4 million to $77.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2008 from $75.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2007, an increase of 3.1%. Changes in foreign exchange of $0.1 million had an unfavorable effect on SG&A costs. The remaining increase in SG&A costs was mainly due to additional branch costs of $5.0 million associated with the growth of our companys business, and increased training and quality costs of $1.4 million from our investment in recruitment and retention of our care workers. These increased costs were partially offset by decreased IT costs of $1.4 million from infrastructure efficiencies in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 and expenses incurred in the year ended September 30, 2007 related to severance costs and related professional fees of $1.2 million incurred upon the resignation of the chairman and chief executive officer, issuance of new warrants and modification to extend the expiration date on warrants previously issued of $0.4 million and chief executive officer search fees and consultancy costs associated with compliance under our senior credit facility of $0.7 million.   Interest Income     Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2008 was $0.9 million compared to $0.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2007. The increase in interest income was mainly attributable to additional cash on hand as a result of the sale of the respiratory therapy division in fiscal 2007.   Interest Expense      Total interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2008 was $0.5 million compared to $4.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2007, which represents a decrease of $3.7 million. This decrease was principally due to the prepayment and pay-off of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility and was partially offset by costs related to the suspension of the availability of our invoice discount facility. As such, we recognized interest costs of $0.4 million for bank fees.   Provision for Income Taxes     We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $3.8 million or 29.9% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2008, compared to a provision of $2.1 million or 36.4% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2007. The difference in the effective tax rate between the year ended September 30, 2008 and the year ended September 30, 2007 was mainly due to the utilization of loss carry forwards and permanent differences.     - 37 -         Discontinued Operations     Discontinued operations resulted in income of $62.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2007. On September 30, 2007, we disposed of two of our U.K. subsidiaries when we sold all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Allied Respiratory Limited and Medigas Limited for £36.5 million ($74.7 million) in cash, of which £0.5 million ($1.0 million) was held back until certain conditions are met. Of the escrowed amount, £0.4 million ($0.9 million) was released to us in fiscal 2008 and the remaining £0.1 million ($0.1 million) was released to us in fiscal 2009. These two subsidiaries constituted our respiratory therapy division, which supplied medical-grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to pharmacies in the U.K., oxygen concentrators to customers in Northern Ireland and oxygen services to customers in the South East of England. Included in the $62.7 million in income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2007 was the gain of $56.5 million, net of tax of $0, on the sale of our respiratory therapy division. Under U.K. tax legislation, enacted in April 2002, disposals of shares by companies with substantial shareholdings does not result in a taxable gain transaction.   We have accounted for our respiratory therapy division as a discontinued operation. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our respiratory therapy division for the prior period are reported in discontinued operations on our statement of operations.   The following table presents the financial results for the discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 (dollars in thousands).                                            Year Ended                     September 30,                     2007              Revenues:                          Net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies         $    28,699                                      Cost of revenues:                          Respiratory, medical equipment and supplies              13,024                                                            Gross profit              15,675                                      Selling, general and administrative expenses              6,091                                                            Operating income from discontinued operations              9,584                                      Interest income              2           Interest expense              (1,570          )(a)                                                       Income from discontinued operations before income tax              8,016                                      Gain on disposal of subsidiaries, net of tax              56,471           (b)                                 Provision for income taxes              1,750           (c)                                                       Income from discontinued operations         $    62,737                                                         (a)         In fiscal 2007, interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on debt that we specifically identified as being attributable to discontinued operations, as an allocation based on net assets would not provide a meaningful result. We based our allocation on the amount of capital expenditures directly related to our discontinued operations and then considered cash borrowings necessary to maintain the operations of our then respiratory therapy division.         - 38 -                                 (b)         Translation adjustments that result when a foreign entitys financial statements are translated into a parent companys or an investors reporting currency are separately reported in the parent companys other comprehensive income. Foreign currency translation adjustments that are accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to income only when they are realized, if the investment in the foreign entity is sold or is substantially or completed liquidated. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation adjustments of the balance sheet related to the respiratory therapy segment in the amount of approximately $1.6 million were reclassified into the gain on disposal of subsidiaries.           (c)         Included in the provision for income taxes for the year end September 30, 2007 was the reversal of $0.7 million of certain tax contingencies related to our fiscal 2003 discontinued operations on the sale of two of our U.S. subsidiaries as the statute of limitations has expired.       Net Income     As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of $8.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2008 compared to net income of $66.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2007.   Liquidity and Capital Resources     General     For our fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, we generated $15.7 million from continuing operating activities. Cash requirements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 for capital expenditures ($2.9 million) and for payments of acquisitions payable ($1.1 million) were met through cash on hand.   We believe that the existing capital resources and those to be generated from operating activities will be adequate to conduct our operations for the next 12 months.   Accounts Receivable     We maintain a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008, $19.6 million (11.3%) and $17.8 million (9.7%) ,  respectively, of our total assets consisted of accounts receivable. The increase in accounts receivable from 2008 to 2009 is mainly due to the timing of invoicing as well as a higher volume of business.   Our goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than 45 days (including unbilled accounts receivable), which would tend to mitigate the risk of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. We maintain credit controls to ensure cash collection on a timely basis. Days sales outstanding (DSOs), excluding unbilled accounts receivable, is a measure of the average number of days taken by our company to collect its accounts receivable, calculated from the date services are invoiced. The timing of our invoicing and cash collections as well as the pattern of our weekly invoicing cycles causes fluctuations in our monthly DSOs. At September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008, our average DSOs (excluding unbilled accounts receivable) were 25 and 21, respectively.     - 39 -         At September 30, 2009 gross receivables, excluding unapplied cash and surcharges, were $21.8 million, of which $16.6 million or 76.3% were represented by amounts due from U.K. governmental bodies, either the local governmental social service departments (SSDs) or the NHS. At September 30, 2008 gross receivables, excluding unapplied cash and surcharges, were $21.5 million, of which $15.2 million or 70.7% were represented by amounts due from U.K. governmental bodies. The remaining accounts receivable balance is due from commercial payors (nursing homes and private hospitals) and private payors.   The following table summarizes the accounts receivable aging by payor mix at September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 (dollars in thousands):

            (A)         Surcharges represent interest charges to customers on overdue accounts. The surcharges are recognized in income only upon receipt of payment.       Each fiscal year we undertake a review of our methodology and procedure for reserving for our doubtful accounts. This process also takes into account our actual experience of write offs in the period. The policy is then applied at each quarter end to arrive at a closing reserve for doubtful accounts. See Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounts Receivable above for a description of our methodology procedure.     - 40 -         Given the high percentage of U.K. governmental debt, the large number of customer accounts with low-value debt within the remainder of the accounts receivable ledger and the methodology for making provisions for doubtful accounts, we believe our provisioning method is prudent and appropriate to our business.   We provide homecare aides and nurses on the basis of terms (payment due within 7 to 30 days of invoice) and prices (rate per hour or fraction of an hour) agreed to in advance with our customers. The work is either logged by electronic call monitoring or time sheets are signed by clients for the work performed and then invoices are generated based on agreed billing rates. Consequently, there is no process for approval of invoices. Our credit control policies currently achieve an average collection of approximately 25 days from submission of invoices.   As our current operations are in the United Kingdom and the majority of accounts receivable are from U.K. governmental bodies for which payment terms and prices are agreed in advance, we have not recorded any contractual allowances.   Borrowings     General      At September 30, 2009, we had no outstanding borrowings.   In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, our U.K. subsidiary, Allied Healthcare Group Holdings Limited (Allied Holdings), obtained a senior credit facility, which was amended in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 to provide for additional facilities. The facility consisted of a term loan A, revolving loan B1, invoice discounting facility B2 and revolving loan C. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Allied Holdings prepaid the amounts outstanding under the term loan A and the term loan B1 facilities from the proceeds of sale of our respiratory therapy division in fiscal 2007. Allied Holdings also cancelled term loan A, term loan B1 and revolving loan C in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Allied Holdings had retained the £7.5 million ($12.4) invoice discounting facility B2. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we agreed with the banks to suspend the availability of our invoice discount facility and to have the right to reinstate availability upon nine weeks notice. As we did not anticipate reinstating the invoice discount facility we recognized interest costs of $0.4 million for bank fees in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we cancelled the invoice discounting facility B2, thus terminating the senior credit facility.   Guarantees     The senior credit facility was secured by a first priority lien on the assets of Allied Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries. Together with Allied Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries, our company had guaranteed the debt and other obligations of certain wholly-owned U.K. subsidiaries under the senior credit facility. In conjunction with the amendment to the senior credit facility, we granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the payment of our guarantee. At September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008, there were no amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we terminated the senior credit facility and the liens and guarantees under such facility have since been released.     - 41 -         Financial Instrument      See Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk.   Commitments     Employment Agreements     See Item 11Executive CompensationEmployment Agreements; Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.   Operating Leases     We have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space and equipment. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options.   Contractual Cash Obligations     As described under Borrowings and CommitmentsOperating Leases above, the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2009 (dollars in thousands):                                                                                    Total Lease              Total Other              Total           Fiscal         Obligations              Obligations              Obligations              2010         $    2,378              $    721              $    3,099           2011              1,472                   958                   2,430           2012              858                   718                   1,576           2013              300                   207                   507           2014              120                                      120           Thereafter              69                                      69                                                                         $    5,197              $    2,604              $    7,801                                                                Lease obligations reflect future minimum rental commitments required under operating lease agreements as of September 30, 2009. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options. Other obligations represent our contractual commitment for a new branch operating system and investment bank fees associated with our capital resources review. We anticipate incurring total expenditures for our new branch operating system, both contractual and non-contractual, including software, hardware, hosting services and training costs, of approximately $6.7 million (at the closing exchange rate at September 30, 2009), of which $2.9 million was incurred in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 and $3.8 million is expected to be incurred in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011. We anticipate that funding will come from our existing cash and cash provided by operating activities.     - 42 -         Miscellaneous     Treasury Shares     In January 2001, we initiated a stock repurchase program, whereby we may purchase up to approximately $1.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. In May 2003, we initiated a second stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may purchase up to an additional $3.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. As of September 30, 2009, we had acquired 407,700 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.3 million pursuant to our stock repurchase programs, which are reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2009. In addition, as of September 30, 2009, we had acquired 177,055 shares of our companys common stock for an aggregate value of $1.0 million from certain of our former executive officers. Such  shares were acquired in fiscal 2004 and delivered to us as payment on promissory notes issued by us to them.   Disposition     On September 30, 2007, we sold all of the shares of Allied Respiratory Limited to Air Liquide Limited. Allied Respiratory Limited and its subsidiary, Medigas Limited, constituted the respiratory therapy division of our company. The consideration for the sale was denominated in sterling and consisted of £36.5 million ($74.7 million), of which £0.5 million ($1.0 million) was held back until certain conditions are met. Of the escrowed amount, £0.4 million ($0.9 million) was released to us in fiscal 2008 and the remaining £0.1 million ($0.1 million) was released to us in fiscal 2009.   We have accounted for our respiratory therapy division as a discontinued operation. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our respiratory therapy division for prior periods are reported in discontinued operations in our statement of operations.   See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 for a discussion and details of discontinued operations, including an analysis of the pro forma effects on our financial statements of the discontinued operations.   Litigation      See Item 3Legal Proceedings.   Contingencies     See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 for a discussion of contingencies.   Impact of Recent Accounting Standards     See Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2009.     - 43 -            Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    Foreign Currency Exchange     We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results. Currently, we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposures.   The translation of the operating results of our U.K. operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the fiscal 2009 year as compared to the fiscal 2008 average rate, the translation of our U.K. financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in decreased revenues of $67.9 million, decreased operating income of $4.4 million and decreased income from continuing operations of $2.4 million. We estimate that a 10% change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar would have a $25.0 million, $1.6 million and $0.9 million impact on reported revenues, operating income and income from continuing operations, respectively.   Interest Rate Risk     Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments purchased with initial maturities of 90 days or less.      Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
