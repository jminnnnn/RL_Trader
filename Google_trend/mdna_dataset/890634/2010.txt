related to interest rate swaps no longer being effective.         - 33 -                                 (4)         During our annual review of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we determined there was an impairment of $110.0 million to our recorded goodwill balance by using a combination of the market multiple, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow methods. Based on a combination of factors, contributing to the impairment loss were the decrease in profits due to the decline of revenues from the NHS, our companys market capitalization at the time of testing as well as current and projected operating results.           (5)         Includes a charge of $9.0 million of software costs related to certain aspects of our information system that were based on the Oracle platform that was too slow for the nature of our business and therefore was not achieving full functionality. Also includes a charge of $1.0 million relate to the write-off of other intangible assets. We reviewed the carrying amount of our other intangibles and deemed certain assets to be impaired as of September 30, 2006 as a result of the decline in revenues from the NHS.          Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     General     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in conjunction with the description of our business included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position. This discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainty. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Forward-Looking Statements.   We are a leading provider of flexible, or temporary, healthcare staffing services to the healthcare and social care industry in the United Kingdom, as measured by revenues, market share and number of staff. Our flexible healthcare staffing service provides personal or basic care and nursing services in the customers own homes, public or private hospitals and nursing and care homes. Homecare staffing, which accounts for over 85% of our healthcare staffing services, is provided for individuals (normally elderly individuals) who require domiciliary care, individuals with learning disabilities and individuals of all ages who require health-related services for complex care needs. The main purchaser of our services for customers own homes is local governmental social service departments, private individuals, the Health and Social Care Board and National Health Services (the NHS) Primary Care Trusts. We also supply nursing staff services to nursing homes and hospitals that account for our remaining healthcare staffing services.   In May 2010, we acquired a shareholding in a group of business commonly known as Homecare Independent Living Group (HILG), which has operations in Ireland. We acquired a 50.1% shareholding in L&B (No. 182) Limited, the holding company of the five entities that make up the HILG business, for a consideration of £3.9 million ($5.7 million, at the acquisition date exchange rate), subject to adjustment based on the final value of the net assets. This was funded through the companys cash on hand. In addition, we also entered into call option agreements giving us the right to buy the remaining shares between March 2013 and March 2020. The sellers have also entered into put option agreements giving them the right to require us to buy the remaining shares between March 2011 and March 2020. The minimum amount payable by us for 100% of the HILG business will be £7.7 million ($12.1 million at the closing exchange rate at September 30, 2010). The maximum amount payable by us for 100% of the HILG business will be £11.2 million ($17.7 million at the closing exchange rate at September 30, 2010) and is subject to HILG achieving certain annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization targets.     - 34 -         HILG is a leading provider of homecare to the elderly, physically disabled and mentally disabled in Northern Ireland with four operating divisions and an increasing presence in the Republic of Ireland. This acquisition gives us a market-leading position in Northern Ireland as well as a strategic footprint in the Republic of Ireland market. Both are new territories for us with what management believes to be a good growth potential. The two sellers of HILG remain in their existing roles as directors of HILG and have been joined by additional directors appointed by us to this business.   Our services are provided by our integrated network of approximately 115 branches, which have similar economic characteristics and which are located throughout most of the U.K. The operations of our recent acquisition in Ireland are effectively reviewed as one branch as they provide comparable services and are operated on a similar basis as our U.K. operations. Our healthcare staff consists principally of homecare aides (known as carers in the U.K.), nurses and nurses aides. Our management evaluates operating results on a branch basis. All our branches are aggregated into one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes.   Effective January 1, 2010, the standard rate of U.K. value-added tax (VAT) reverted to 17.5% (from the previous rate of 15%) and will further increase to 20% effective January 4, 2011, which has and will continue to increase the amount of any irrecoverable VAT cost.   We are aware of legislative changes which will go into effect in fiscal 2011 that would disallow the U.K. tax deduction on intra-group interest expense. We are currently evaluating our intra-group position and the likely impact of this change on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.   A further legislative change that will go into effect in April 2011 is the U.K. governments introduction of a 1% increase to the national insurance employer contribution amounts. The extent to which we can recover this additional cost from our customers is uncertain and could impact our profit margins.   In July 2010, the U.K. Finance Bill 2010 was published. As of September 30, 2010 it passed through the House of Commons. As published, the U.K. Finance Bill 2010, announced that the rate of corporation tax will be reducing to 27% from April 2011 and will be reducing to 24% by April 2014. We are currently evaluating the likely impact of this proposed change on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.   The Pensions Act 2008 is to be introduced in phases, over a five year period beginning in 2012, and will require employers to automatically enroll all eligible jobholders, who are not already in a qualifying workplace or personal pension plan, into either a qualifying workplace or personal pension plan or a new type of savings arrangement, known as the personal accounts plan.      - 35 -          Automatic enrollment means that if jobholders do not wish to be a member of the plan offered to them they must actively opt out of that arrangement. Initially employers will be required to contribute a minimum of 1% of the jobholders qualifying earnings. Upon the final phase in of the legislation, employers will be required to contribute a minimum of 3% of the jobholders qualifying earnings, which will be supplemented by contributions from the jobholder so that, in total, the pension contribution for each jobholder should equal a minimum of 8% of the jobholders qualifying earnings. There will be limits set on the amount that employers and jobholders can contribute in any one year. The personal accounts plan will be a new trust-based occupational plan, which is independent of the U.K. government and run by a trustee corporation. The extent to which we can recover this additional cost from our customers is uncertain and could impact our profit margins.   In order to reduce the U.K. governments fiscal deficit, following its Comprehensive Spending Review, HM Treasury announced in October 2010 its plans to achieve a significant reduction in public spending. While the U.K. government has stated that it will increase spending in the NHS over the next four years to support healthcare, we note the increase will be partially offset as the NHS has increased obligations and cost of treatments going forward due to the growing population and demand for better healthcare. However, the Comprehensive Spending Review will also allocate £2 billion (approximately $3.2 billion at the closing exchange rate at September 30, 2010) a year of additional funding by 2014-2015 to support social care. The Comprehensive Spending Review also announced significant cuts in funding to local authorities, who are the main providers of social care, and other public bodies, which are a key source of revenue to us. While we expect some negative impacts on our business as a result of the upcoming changes, we believe that new opportunities will arise from the Comprehensive Spending Review (for example, potential reallocation of money from residential to homecare) and the high quality of our services, our dedicated and caring personnel and our strong market reputation will continue to drive demand for our homecare services. We will monitor this closely.   The U.K. government is also seeking to introduce a greater level of personalization. Personalization is a social care approach which aims for social care services users to have control over how money allocated to their care is spent to achieve their own individual needs for independence, well-being and dignity.   Another of the U.K. governments visions is for primary and community care to provide high quality, personal care and support, treating people when they are sick and helping them stay healthy, where and when they need it most. The U.K. government wishes to ensure that there is access to a dedicated team of family doctors, community nurses, health visitors, allied health professionals, social care professionals, pharmacists, dentists and opticians, to enable most patients to enjoy good quality care, close to home. The U.K. government recognizes that the NHS needs to achieve an unprecedented transfer of care and treatment from hospital to community settings and that community services have a pivotal role to play in this. Accordingly, the U.K. government has stated that it wants to build on the services which are currently provided in the community to create one integrated sustainable structure.     - 36 -         In addition to the personalization agenda and the opportunity for service users and patients to effectively commission their own care, the U.K. government is also radically reforming the NHS organizations that currently commission care, with the proposed abolition of Strategic Health Authorities (the SHAs) and NHS Primary Care Trust with whom we currently deal and replacing them with NHS Commissioning Boards and General Practitioner Commissioning Consortia (GP Consortia). The GP Consortia will be given freedom and responsibility for commissioning healthcare for their local communities. Services will be more responsive to patients and designed around their needs, and local authorities will play a new role of supporting integration across health and social care. In the meantime, SHAs and NHS Primary Care Trust will be phased out, and management costs will be reduced to commit more resources to support frontline services. While we believe there is large support for more care at home, away from more expensive residential care, these changes and the method of procurement and the extent of some of the current initiatives like personalization and independent budgets and their effects on our business should become clearer over the next twelve months. We will continue to monitor this closely.   Finally, we believe that there is potential for further outsourcing of homecare by local governments and NHS Primary Care Trusts. However, both governmental and NHS bodies are under pressure to achieve significant cost savings and efficiencies. Consequently, the benefits arising from the potential for outsourcing may be reduced by tighter local governmental and NHS Primary Care Trust budgets or by policy changes or legislation.   Critical Accounting Policies     The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures in a given reporting period. We believe the following accounting policies are critical areas affecting our financial condition and results of operations where estimates are required.   Accounts Receivable     We are required to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivables, which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current credit-worthiness of each customer. Significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future as we continue to expand our business and as conditions in the marketplace change.   Our company maintains credit controls to ensure cash collection on a timely basis. The credit terms agreed with our customers range from 7 days to a maximum of 30 days from invoice date. We maintain a credit department which consists of approximately 20 personnel who are targeted to collect outstanding receivables. We have established the following guidelines for the credit department to use as well as for us to assess the credit departments performance:                      to maintain average days sales outstanding (including unbilled accounts receivable) to below 45 days;                          to limit our overdues (greater than 90 days) within agreed targets; and                          to limit bad debt write off in the year within agreed targets.         - 37 -               We also apply a policy of withdrawing supply from customers who are significantly overdue. Many private customers are contracted on a direct debit basis where we can collect payment direct from customers bank accounts.   We have devised a provisioning methodology based on the customer profile and historical credit risk across our U.K. business. Accounts receivable are written off when the credit control department determines the amount is no longer collectible. In addition, we do not have a threshold for account balance write-offs as our policy focuses on all balances, whatever the size.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets     We have significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in strategy and/or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill. We have recorded goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions through September 30, 2010. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A more frequent evaluation is performed if indicators of impairment are present. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, we determined that there were not such indicators. We completed the annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill balance. The calculation of fair value used for an impairment test includes a number of estimates and assumptions, including future income and cash flow projections, the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate. If we are required to record an impairment charge in the future, it could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   Income Taxes     We account for income taxes using the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect tax carryforwards and the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes, as determined under currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recorded if future realization is more likely than not. Deferred taxes are recorded primarily for foreign, federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, and depreciation and amortization of intangibles, which are reported in different periods for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The determination of whether or not valuation allowances are required to be recorded involves significant estimates regarding the future profitability of our company, as well as potential tax strategies for the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. As of September 30, 2010, we had recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset created by the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward as we did not believe it was more likely than not that such losses would be utilized prior to their expiration. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such recognition.     - 38 -         We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of September 30, 2010, our company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits, which remains unchanged from September 30, 2009.   Contingencies     We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.   Revenue Recognition     Patient services are recognized when services are performed and substantiated by proper documentation. For patient services, which are billed at fixed rates, revenue is mainly recognized upon the completion of timesheets that also require the signature of the recipient of our services and through electronic call monitoring.   We receive a majority of our revenue from local governmental social service or health and social care service departments and the NHS. For the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, 83.3%, 75.0%, and 69.0%, respectively, of our net revenues were attributable to local governmental social service departments and the NHS payor program.   Business Combinations     Amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. We obtain a third-party valuation in order to complete our purchase price allocations. Accordingly, final asset and liability fair values as well as useful lives may differ from managements original estimates and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   Results of Operations     Overview     We are one of the larger suppliers of homecare services in the U.K. Current trends in homecare services that have contributed to the growth of this business include the increasing shift from care in residential homes to care in the home, which in most cases is a lower cost option, an increase in the aging population and additional opportunities as a result of the increase in demand for higher sophisticated homecare service lines, such as continuing care and care for individuals with learning disabilities. Over the last year we have seen a switch away from the traditional larger block/spot contract tenders to smaller framework preferred supplier contracts, often in specialist services.     - 39 -         In order to reduce the U.K. governments fiscal deficit, following its Comprehensive Spending Review, HM Treasury announced in October 2010 its plans to achieve a significant reduction in public spending. While the U.K. government has stated that it will increase spending in the NHS over the next four years to support healthcare, we note the increase will be partially offset as the NHS has increased obligations and cost of treatments going forward due to the growing population and demand for better healthcare. However, the Comprehensive Spending Review will also allocate £2 billion (approximately $3.2 billion at the closing exchange rate at September 30, 2010) a year of additional funding by 2014-2015 to support social care. The Comprehensive Spending Review also announced significant cuts in funding to local authorities and other public bodies, which are a key source of revenue to us. As a result of the imminent budget social care cuts that were anticipated after the recent U.K. government change we have already not seen typical increases in either service prices or the number of service hours in the quarter ended September 30, 2010.   While we expect some negative impacts on our business as a result of the upcoming changes, we believe that new opportunities will arise from the Comprehensive Spending Review (for example, potential reallocation of money from residential to homecare) and the high quality of our services, our dedicated and caring personnel and our strong market reputation will continue to drive demand for our homecare services.   Nursing homes results have been impacted by the general economic market. We have experienced a lesser demand for our services from nursing homes, which we believe is a result of the economic recession, as nursing homes are trying to reduce their costs as well as their own permanent staff working additional hours. In addition, nursing homes have been impacted by the general move of care from establishments to homecare as well as the fact that smaller suppliers, who previously serviced local government authority work and social services, are focusing more on agency business.   The NHS requires any healthcare staffing company that provides temporary staff to NHS Hospitals in a region to enter into a Framework Agreement setting forth, among other things, applicable quality standards and maximum payment rates.   In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we opened a new Midland hospital business hub from which we hope to see benefits arising from this in our next fiscal year. If successful, we will consider extending this hub approach into other key cities.   Year Ended September 30, 2010 vs. Year Ended September 30, 2009     To provide an increased understanding of our companys business we are providing a breakdown of our revenues, gross profits, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs and operating income at constant exchange rates using the comparable prior period weighted average exchange rate.     - 40 -

measures that exclude the impact of foreign exchange and acquisition costs on our current period results. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding our companys results of operations, as these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The chart also provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures.     - 41 -         Revenues     Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2010, before the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, increased by $20.0 million, or 8.0%, to $269.8 million, compared with $249.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. Contributing to the increase in revenues was homecare revenues which grew by 13.7% to $231.7 million. The acquisition of HILG completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 contributed 3.2%, or $6.5 million, to the increase in homecare revenues. Nursing home revenues declined by 28.6% to $18.5 million. Hospitals revenues decreased by 2.4% to $19.6 million. After the favorable impact of currency exchange of $1.3 million, revenues increased to $271.1 million.   Gross Profit     Gross profit, before the favorable impact of foreign exchange, increased 7.3% to $81.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2010 from $76.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. Homecare gross profit grew 12.9% to $71.3 million. The acquisition of HILG completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 contributed $2.0 million, or 3.1%, to the increase in homecare gross profit. Nursing homes gross profit declined 26.3% to $6.0 million and hospitals gross profit declined 9.0% to $4.6 million. Changes in foreign exchange increased gross profit by $0.4 million to $82.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2010 compared to $76.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2009, an increase of 7.8%. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2010 was 30.4%, as compared to 30.6% for the comparable prior period mainly due to our sales mix and tightening economic conditions in the United Kingdom.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses     Total SG&A expenses for the year ended September 30, 2010, before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and excluding acquisition costs of $0.8 million related to our acquisition of HILG in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 as well as costs related to aborted acquisitions, increased by $4.5 million, or 7.2% to $67.7 million (25.1% of revenues) compared to $63.2 million (25.3% of revenues) for the year ended September 30, 2009. The acquisition of HILG contributed $1.5 million, or 2.4%, to this increase in SG&A. The remaining increase is mainly a result of us incurring additional costs, in the current fiscal year, in certain areas of our business mainly related to the opening of new branches, investment in specialized service lines which include continuing care and learning disabilities, and costs associated with process improvements including the roll out of our new IT system, all to ensure that we support future growth in revenues. For the year ended September 30, 2010 our training costs were reduced by training support grants in respect of training provided to carers of $1.6 million, which was partially offset by grant-related monitoring and compliance costs incurred of $0.8 million. For the year ended September 30, 2009, we had a reduction in training costs from receipts of training support grants of $2.1 million, which was partially offset by grant-related monitoring and compliance costs incurred of $1.4 million. However, lower U.K. government spending arising from the Comprehensive Spending Review may result in lower training support grants being awarded, which may increase our training costs. At the same time, we maintain tight controls over other areas of SG&A costs so as to maintain our objective of reducing SG&A costs as a percent of revenues. Changes in foreign exchange increased the reported result by $0.3 million to $68.8 million compared to $63.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2009.     - 42 -         Interest Income     Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2010 was $0.4 million compared to $0.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. The decrease in interest income was mainly attributable to a decrease in interest rates.   Foreign exchange loss     Total foreign exchange loss for the year ended September 30, 2010 was $0.2 million compared to $0.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. Foreign exchange is impacted by gains or losses resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on our intercompany obligations for which settlement is intended.   Provision for Income Taxes     We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $3.5 million or 25.9% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2010, compared to a provision of $3.4 million or 25.5% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2009.   Income From Continuing Operations     As a result of the foregoing, we recorded income from continuing operations of $10.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2010 compared to income from continuing operations of $9.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2009.   Discontinued Operations     In fiscal 2007, we disposed of two of our U.K. subsidiaries when we sold the shares of Allied Respiratory Limited and Medigas Limited. These two subsidiaries constituted our respiratory therapy division, which supplied medical-grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to pharmacies in the U.K., oxygen concentrators to customers in Northern Ireland and oxygen services to customers in the South East of England. We have accounted for our respiratory therapy segment as a discontinued operation.   In the year ended September 30, 2009, discontinued operations resulted in income, net of tax, of $0.4 million due to the reversal of accrued refunds payable and accrued patient electric usage reimbursement as the warranty period under the sales agreement covering these costs had expired.   Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest     Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $0.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2010.     - 43 -         Net Income Attributable to Allied Healthcare International Inc.     As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of $9.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2010 compared to net income of $10.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2009.

accordance with GAAP , the chart above shows non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of foreign exchange on our current period results. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding our companys results of operations, as these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The chart also provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures.   Revenues     Total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2009, before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, increased by $19.1 million, or 6.4%, to $317.7 million, compared with $298.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. Contributing to the increase in revenues was homecare revenues which grew by 15.0% to $259.3 million. Nursing home revenues declined by 21.4% to $32.9 million. Hospitals revenues decreased by 18.4% to $25.5 million. After the unfavorable impact of currency exchange of $67.9 million, revenues decreased to $249.8 million.     - 44 -         Gross Profit     Gross profit, before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, increased 7.4% to $97.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 from $90.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. Changes in foreign exchange decreased gross profit by $20.8 million to $76.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 compared to gross profit of $90.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2008, a decrease of 15.5%. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2009 was 30.6%, as compared to 30.3% for the comparable prior period mainly due to our sales mix. We remain focused on supplying healthcare staffing services to our higher-margin homecare customers.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses     Total SG&A expenses for the year ended September 30, 2009, before the favorable impact of foreign exchange, was $79.6 million compared to $77.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. While current period SG&A running costs of 25.3% of revenues are lower than the prior year period of 26.0%, we are continuing to invest in certain areas of our business that includes such items as continuing care, learning disabilities, IT systems, and business improvement projects to ensure that we support future growth in revenues. At the same time, we maintain tight controls over other areas of SG&A costs so as to maintain our objective of reducing SG&A costs as a percent of revenues. The increase in SG&A costs is mainly related to the opening of new branches, investment in specialized service lines which include continuing care and learning disabilities, and costs associated with process improvements including the roll out of our new IT system. This increase was partially offset by additional net receipts of currently available government grants for training support of $0.6 million as compared to the prior year. We aim to ensure that we maintain any growth in SG&A costs to a lower degree than growth in our revenues. Changes in foreign exchange decreased the reported result by $16.4 million to $63.2 million compared to $77.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2008.   Interest Income     Total interest income for the year ended September 30, 2009 was $0.5 million compared to $0.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. Even though we had higher cash balances, interest income was negatively impacted by the decrease in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange ($0.1 million).   Provision for Income Taxes     We recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to $3.4 million or 25.5% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2009, compared to a provision of $3.8 million or 29.9% of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2008. The difference in the effective tax rate between the year ended September 30, 2009 and the year ended September 30, 2008 is mainly due to the utilization of loss carry forwards in the U.S. for which no benefit had been previously recorded, permanent differences and change in enacted rate in the U.K.     - 45 -         Discontinued Operations     In fiscal 2007, we disposed of two of our U.K. subsidiaries when we sold the shares of Allied Respiratory Limited and Medigas Limited. These two subsidiaries constituted our respiratory therapy division, which supplied medical-grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to pharmacies in the U.K., oxygen concentrators to customers in Northern Ireland and oxygen services to customers in the South East of England. We have accounted for our respiratory therapy segment as a discontinued operation.   In the year ended September 30, 2009, discontinued operations resulted in income, net of tax, of $0.4 million due to the reversal of accrued refunds payable and accrued patient electric usage reimbursement as the warranty period under the sales agreement covering these costs has expired.   Net Income     As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of $10.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 compared to net income of $8.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2008.   Liquidity and Capital Resources     General     For our fiscal year ended September 30, 20010, we generated $16.0 million from continuing operating activities. Cash requirements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 for acquisition of controlling interest ($5.7), capital expenditures ($2.8 million) and for treasury shares acquired ($3.8 million) were met through cash on hand.   We believe that the existing capital resources and those to be generated from operating activities will be adequate to conduct our operations for the next 12 months.   Accounts Receivable     We maintain a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, $20.1 million (10.6%) and $19.6 million (11.3%) ,  respectively, of our total assets consisted of accounts receivable. The increase in accounts receivable from 2009 to 2010 is mainly due to the timing of invoicing as well as a higher volume of business.   Our goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than 45 days (including unbilled accounts receivable), which would tend to mitigate the risk of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. We maintain credit controls to ensure cash collection on a timely basis. Days sales outstanding (DSOs), excluding unbilled accounts receivable , is a measure of the average number of days taken by our company to collect its accounts receivable, calculated from the date services are invoiced. The timing of our invoicing and cash collections as well as the pattern of our weekly invoicing cycles causes fluctuations in our monthly DSOs. At September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, our average DSOs (excluding unbilled accounts receivable) were 26 and 25, respectively. At September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, our average DSOs (including unbilled accounts receivable) were 43 and 40, respectively.     - 46 -         At September 30, 2010 gross receivables, excluding unapplied cash and surcharges, were $22.2 million, of which $17.6 million or 79.5% were represented by amounts due from governmental bodies, either local governmental social service departments or health and social care departments (SHSD) or the NHS. At September 30, 2009 gross receivables, excluding unapplied cash and surcharges, were $21.8 million, of which $16.6 million or 76.3% were represented by amounts due from U.K. governmental bodies. The remaining accounts receivable balance is due from commercial payors (nursing homes and private hospitals) and private payors.   The following table summarizes the accounts receivable aging by payor mix at September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009 (dollars in thousands):                                                                                                                                                0-30              31-60              61-90              91-120              121 Days              AR At           At September 30, 2010         Days              Days              Days              Days              And Over              9/30/2010              SHSD         $    4,952              $    602              $    140              $    60              $    121              $    5,875           NHS              9,540                   1,425                   318                   162                   325                   11,770           Commercial Payors              1,674                   376                   63                   24                   54                   2,191           Private Payors              1,860                   142                   91                   68                   186                   2,347                                                                                                            Gross AR at 9/30/10         $    18,026              $    2,545              $    612              $    314              $    686              $    22,183                                                                                                                 Less: Unapplied Cash                                                                                                                  (1,120    )      Less: Surcharges (A)                                                                                                                  (239    )      Less: Allowance For Doubtful Accounts                                                                                                                  (732    )                                                                                                                                Accounts Receivable, net                                                                                                             $    20,092                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0-30              31-60              61-90              91-120              121 Days              AR At           At September 30, 2009         Days              Days              Days              Days              And Over              9/30/2009              SHSD         $    9,138              $    769              $    484              $    181              $    359              $    10,931           NHS              4,670                   554                   241                   90                   161                   5,716           Commercial Payors              2,200                   262                   64                   33                   32                   2,591           Private Payors              1,994                   157                   104                   60                   275                   2,590                                                                                                            Gross AR at 9/30/09         $    18,002              $    1,742              $    893              $    364              $    827              $    21,828                                                                                                                 Less: Unapplied Cash                                                                                                                  (1,124    )      Less: Surcharges (A)                                                                                                                  (271    )      Less: Allowance For Doubtful Accounts                                                                                                                  (839    )                                                                                                                                Accounts Receivable, net                                                                                                             $    19,594                                                                                                                                                             (A)         Surcharges represent interest charges to customers on overdue accounts. The surcharges are recognized in income only upon receipt of payment.       Each fiscal year we undertake a review of our methodology and procedure for reserving for our doubtful accounts. This process also takes into account our actual experience of write offs in the period. The policy is then applied at each quarter end to arrive at a closing reserve for doubtful accounts. See Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounts Receivable above for a description of our methodology procedure.     - 47 -         Given the high percentage of U.K. governmental debt, the large number of customer accounts with low-value debt within the remainder of the accounts receivable ledger and the methodology for making provisions for doubtful accounts, we believe our provisioning method is prudent and appropriate to our business.   We provide homecare aides and nurses on the basis of terms (payment due within 7 to 30 days of invoice) and prices (rate per hour or fraction of an hour) agreed to in advance with our customers. The work is either logged by electronic call monitoring or time sheets are signed by clients for the work performed and then invoices are generated based on agreed billing rates. Consequently, there is no process for approval of invoices. Our credit control policies currently achieve an average collection of approximately 26 days from submission of invoices.   As our current operations are predominantly in the United Kingdom and the majority of accounts receivable are from U.K. governmental bodies for which payment terms and prices are agreed in advance, we have not recorded any contractual allowances.   Debt and Capital Leases     See Leases and Debt under Commitments below.   Financial Instrument      See Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk.   Commitments     Employment Agreements     See Item 11Executive CompensationEmployment Agreements; Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.   Leases     We have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space and equipment, as well as housing accommodations used by HILG in providing social care. Certain of these operating leases provide for renewal options. Of the $5.5 million operating lease obligations at September 30, 2010, $0.4 million relates to properties that are owned by the noncontrolling interest holders. In connection with our acquisition of HILG, we assumed various capital lease agreements mainly related to leased vehicles. The present value of the net minimum capital lease payments estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis was $0.7 million at September 30, 2010.   Debt     In connection with our acquisition of HILG, we assumed debt related to two invoice discounting facilities and bank loan for the funding of capital expenditures. The invoice discounting facilities provide for available funds of up to $1.5 million (at the closing exchange rate at September 30, 2010) that mature in April and June of 2011. The loans bear interest at rates equal to LIBOR plus 2.0% with a minimum of 4.0% per annum. As of September 30, 2010, we had outstanding borrowings of $0.3 million under the invoice discounting facilities and bank loan that bore interest at rates ranging from 4.0% to 4.7%.     - 48 -         Contractual Cash Obligations     The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2010 (dollars in thousands):                                                                                                                            Total                                                                                      Operating              Total Capital                                  Total Other                          Fiscal         Leases              Leases              Total Debt              Obligations              Total Obligations              2011         $    2,732              $    377              $    294              $    1,102              $    4,505           2012              1,591                   278                   40                   1,021                   2,930           2013              734                   128                                      206                   1,068           2014              267                   4                                                         271           2015              136                                                                            136           Thereafter                                                                                                                                                                                       Total:         $    5,460              $    787              $    334              $    2,329              $    8,910                                                                                                  Less: Amounts representing interest                                  (118    )                                                                                                                                                                        Net present value of capital lease obligation                                  669                                                                       Less current portion                                  320                                                                                                                                                                             Long-term lease obligations                             $    349                                                                                                                                                                              Both operating and capital lease obligations reflect future minimum rental commitments required under such lease agreements as of September 30, 2010. Other obligations represent our contractual commitment for a new branch operating system and purchase commitment for new office equipment and software. We anticipate incurring total expenditures for our new branch operating system, both contractual and non-contractual, including software, hardware, hosting services and training costs, of approximately $6.9 million (at the closing exchange rate at September 30, 2010), of which $4.5 million has been incurred in fiscals 2009 and 2010 and $2.4 million is expected to be incurred in fiscal 2011 and 2012. We anticipate that funding will come from our existing cash and cash provided by operating activities.     - 49 -         Miscellaneous     Treasury Shares     In January 2001, we initiated a stock repurchase program, whereby we were authorized to purchase up to approximately $1.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. In May 2003, we initiated a second stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase up to an additional $3.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. In May 2010, these two stock purchase programs were terminated and we initiated a new stock repurchase program, whereby we may purchase up to approximately $10 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions. For the three months and fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we purchased 1.1 million and 1.6 million shares, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million and $3.8 million, respectively, under our May 2010 stock repurchase program. As of September 30, 2010, we had acquired an aggregate of 2.0 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $5.1 million pursuant to our stock repurchase programs (including stock repurchase programs which have been terminated), which are reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2010. In addition, as of September 30, 2010, we had acquired 0.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate value of $1.0 million from certain of our former executive officers. Such shares were acquired in fiscal 2004 and delivered to us as payment on promissory notes issued by us to them.   Litigation      See Item 3  Legal Proceedings.   Contingencies     See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 for a discussion of contingencies.   Impact of Recent Accounting Standards     See Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2010.      Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    Foreign Currency Exchange     We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results. Currently, we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposures.     - 50 -         The translation of the operating results of our U.K. operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the fiscal 2010 year as compared to the fiscal 2009 average rate, the translation of our U.K. financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in increased revenues of $1.3 million, increased operating income of $0.1 million and increased income from continuing operations of $47 thousand. We estimate that a 10% change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar would have a $27.1 million, $1.7 million and $1.0 million impact on reported revenues, operating income and income from continuing operations, respectively.   Interest Rate Risk     Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our invoice discount facilities. Our invoice discounting facilities provide for available funds of up to $1.5 million (at the closing exchange rate at September 30, 2010) and mature in April and June of 2011. We had outstanding borrowings of $0.2 million under the invoice discounting facilities at September 30, 2010. Our remaining debt and capital lease obligations are at fixed interest rates. As such, we believe our exposure to interest rate risk to be minimal.      Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
