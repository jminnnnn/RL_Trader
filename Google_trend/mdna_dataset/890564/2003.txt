Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements regarding our expected financial position and operating results, our business strategy and financing plans are forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from its expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include those discussed in this report under "BusinessRisk Factors."   Overview             On Assignment, Inc. is a leading provider of skilled temporary professionals to clients in the science and healthcare industries. We provide clients in these markets with short-term or long-term assignments of temporary professionals and temporary to permanent placement of these professionals. Our business consists of two operating segments: Healthcare Staffing and Lab Support. Through our Healthcare Staffing segment, we are able to offer our clients temporary professionals, both locally-based and traveling, from more than ten healthcare and medical financial occupations. These temporary professional specialties include nurses, specialty nurses, surgical technicians, imaging technicians, x-ray technicians, medical technicians, cytotechnologists, phlebotomists, coding, billing, claims processing and collections staff. Through our Lab Support segment, we service the domestic and international markets for science professionals and provide temporary and permanent placement of scientific personnel to industrial laboratories in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, chemical, and environmental industries.            Healthcare Staffing segment revenues represented approximately 55 percent of our total revenues for 2002, up from 28 percent in 2001. The significant increase in our Healthcare Staffing segment revenues was principally due to our acquisition of Health Personnel Options Corporation (HPO) in April 2002. Through this acquisition we were able to increase our participation in the growing travel nurse industry, and we increased the number of temporary employees for our Healthcare Staffing segment from approximately 1,300 to 2,000 as of April 2002.            In addition to our acquisition and integration of HPO, we made significant internal upgrades to our business and infrastructure in 2002. In July 2002, we reorganized our Lab Support segment to increase the efficiency of our field management and address organization, productivity and compensation issues. These changes enabled us to avoid a significant performance decline of our Lab Support segment despite a depressed demand environment, particularly for biotechnology-related services, which represented approximately 20% of our domestic assignments made in our Lab Support business in 2002. In November 2002, we completed the reorganization of our Healthcare Staffing segment to more closely align our product offering with the needs of our clients and prospective clients. In December 2002, we initiated a nurse retention program to reduce our holiday attrition rate and better support our clients. During 2002, we also undertook a significant upgrade of our systems infrastructure, transitioning our functionality to an enterprise wide information system utilizing PeopleSoft software. While these changes resulted in increased expenses and lower gross margins, we believe that going forward these changes will enable us to better execute our business strategy, reduce our costs and drive efficiency and productivity throughout the organization.             In addition to our infrastructure investments above, we have undertaken and continue to explore cost rationalization strategies that we believe will yield more productive and cost effective operations. We have reviewed and continue to assess our operations, including the performance of our branch offices in certain markets. As a result of such a review, we are in the process of winding down our operations in Canada and Ireland. Our efforts to streamline our organization and better align our resources and cost structure with our near-term opportunities may include, but are not limited to,    20           further office closures, workforce reductions and reallocation of our personnel resources. These actions may result in increased severance costs, legal and outplacement fees and may cause us to incur a restructuring charge during the period when such cost containment efforts are taken.            Due to a shortage of qualified nurses and low barriers to entry, we continue to see increased competition in the travel nurse business, particularly from local start-up companies. In recent quarters, we have encountered price competition among temporary staffing companies in the travel nurse business. Intensification of or the continuation of price competition in the markets in which we operate could reduce our margins and negatively affect our revenues and market share.    Seasonality             Our results of operations have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations. Demand for our temporary professionals typically declines from the year-end holiday season through February, resulting in a corresponding decrease in revenues, operating income and net income in the first quarter. Demand for our temporary professionals also often declines in June, July and August due to decreases in clients' activity during vacation periods and the availability of students to perform temporary work. As a result, we have also experienced slower growth or declines in revenues, operating income and net income during the second quarter to third quarter.    Critical Accounting Policies             Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.            Allowance For Doubtful Accounts.     We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables based on our analysis of specific accounts and historical collection experiences applied to the remaining general accounts. For specific accounts, we use our judgment, based on available facts and circumstances, to record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected. For the remaining general accounts, a general reserve is established based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories. These percentages are based on historical collection experience. If circumstances change, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could change by a material amount.            Accrued Workers' Compensation.     We are partially self-insured for workers' compensation expense. The workers' compensation program covers all of our temporary professionals and regular employees. In connection with this program, we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported. In order to ensure that the accrued workers' compensation balance is adequate to cover all costs incurred under our workers' compensation program, at the end of each fiscal quarter, an actuarial report is prepared by an independent third party who calculates our self-insurance claim liability based on historical experience and trends of industry data. If historical experiences and industry trends change, the self insurance claim liability calculated by the third-party actuary could change by a material amount.    21                  Contingencies.     We account for contingencies in accordance with FAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." FAS No. 5 requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies such as legal and workers' compensation matters requires us to use our judgment. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss, results of operations may be over or understated.            Goodwill and Identifiable Intangibles.     As discussed in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" as of January 1, 2002. FAS No. 142 requires, subsequent to January 1, 2002, that we review and test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, rather than amortize them. We may be required to review and test for impairment more frequently if an event occurs that indicates that the assets may be impaired. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, FAS 142 requires us to: (1) allocate goodwill to our various businesses to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of those businesses to which goodwill relates; and (3) determine the carrying value of the businesses. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular business, then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires independent valuations of certain internally generated and previously unrecognized intangible assets. When this process is completed, the amount of goodwill impairment will be determined.            The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points throughout the analysis. In estimating the fair value of the businesses with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our 2002 financial statements, we made estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses. Our cashflow forecasts were based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In addition, we made certain judgments about allocating shared assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and accrued workers' compensation to the estimated balance sheet for those businesses. We also considered our market capitalization on January 1, 2002 ($22.97 per share) and December 31, 2002 ($8.52 per share), representing the dates of our impairment tests under FAS 142, in determining the fair value of the respective businesses.             Based on our best estimates, we have concluded that there is no impairment of our goodwill at December 31, 2002. However, changes in these estimates or our market capitalization could cause one or more of the businesses to be valued differently. For example, during the first quarter of 2003, while our long-term business projections did not materially change, we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization. During the first half of 2003, if our market capitalization does not recover to the levels of December 2002 (approximately $226.0 million), we may need to perform another impairment analysis. This analysis could potentially result in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of up to approximately $123.8 million, which is the entire goodwill balance at December 31, 2002. The amount of goodwill impairment will depend upon the estimated value of the businesses to which the goodwill relates and the value of the other assets and liabilities attributed to those businesses at that time.    22          Results of Operations             The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues:             Year Ended December 31,             2000     2001     2002             (Unaudited)         Revenues:     100.0  %  100.0  %  100.0  %    Cost of services     67.3     67.5     70.5                           Gross profit     32.7     32.5     29.5       Selling, general and administrative expenses     18.2     19.9     21.8                           Operating income     14.5     12.6     7.7       Interest income, net     1.2     1.3     0.2                           Income before income taxes     15.7     13.9     7.9       Provision for income taxes     5.8     5.1     3.0                           Net income     9.9  %  8.8  %  4.9  %                           Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2002             Revenues.     Revenues increased $55,693,000 or 28.6 percent from $194,620,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $250,313,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenue resulting from our acquisition of HPO was $94,563,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, our 2002 revenue decreased 20.0 percent or $38,870,000 compared to year ended December 31, 2001.            Lab Support segment's revenues decreased $27,440,000 or 19.7 percent from $139,558,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $112,118,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a 20.4 percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment and a 40.5 percent decrease in permanent placement fee revenue from $3,751,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $2,232,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were adversely impacted by continuing weaker demand for our temporary professionals, particularly in the biotechnology sector, due to a slow down in research and development spending and general economic conditions. Decreased Lab Support segment revenues were partially offset by a 1.4 percent increase in average billing rates during the year ended December 31, 2002.            Healthcare Staffing segment's revenues increased by $83,133,000 or 151.0 percent from $55,062,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $138,195,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenues resulting from our acquisition of HPO were $94,563,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, revenue decreased 20.8 percent from $55,062,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $43,632,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a 24.0 percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, other than revenues related to HPO, were adversely impacted by continuing weaker demand for our temporary professionals due to general economic conditions. Decreased Healthcare Staffing revenues were partially offset by a 16.3 percent increase in permanent placement fee revenue from $572,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $665,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a 9.0 percent increase in average billing rates in the 2002 period.             Cost of Services.     Cost of services consists solely of temporary professionals' compensation, payroll taxes, benefits, housing expense, travel expense and other employment-related expenses. Cost of    23           services increased $45,177,000 or 34.4 percent from $131,343,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $176,520,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Cost of services attributable to the HPO acquisition was $71,033,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, cost of services decreased 19.7 percent or $25,856,000 from $131,343,000 for the 2001 period to $105,487,000 for the 2002 period. The cost of services as a percentage of revenues increased by 3.0 percent from 67.5 percent in the 2001 period to 70.5 percent in the 2002 period. The Lab Support segment's cost of services as a percentage of segment revenues increased by 0.6 percent from 67.3 percent in the 2001 period to 67.9 percent in the 2002 period. This increase was primarily attributable to a 0.7 percent increase in employer paid benefits and a 0.1 percent increase in workers' compensation expense, partially offset by a 0.2 percent decrease in temporary professionals' compensation and payroll taxes. The Healthcare Staffing segment's cost of services as a percentage of segment revenues increased by 4.8 percent from 67.9 percent in the 2001 period to 72.7 percent in the 2002 period. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of HPO, which has a higher cost of services than the other divisions within the Healthcare Staffing segment, partially offset by a 4.9 percent decrease in temporary professionals' compensation and payroll taxes, a 0.2 percent decrease in employer paid benefits and a 0.2 percent decrease in workers' compensation expense.            Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with our network of Staffing Consultants and branch offices, including Staffing Consultants' compensation, rent, other office expenses and advertising for temporary professionals. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include our corporate and support office expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, recruiting and training expenses for Staffing Consultants, corporate advertising and promotion, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $15,909,000 or 41.0 percent from $38,766,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $54,675,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the HPO acquisition were $17,593,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4.3 percent or $1,684,000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from 19.9 percent for the 2001 period to 21.8 percent in the 2002 period primarily due to our internal investments in our business and infrastructure in 2002 and higher fixed operating expenses relative to revenue.            Interest Income.     Interest income, net, decreased 72.8 percent from $2,575,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $700,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of lower interest rate yields earned during the 2002 period on lower interest bearing cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities account balances, primarily due to cash used in the HPO acquisition, and interest expense of $100,000 incurred in 2002 as a result of debt acquired in the HPO acquisition.            Provision for Income Taxes.     Provision for income taxes decreased 24.6 percent from $10,046,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $7,570,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Our effective tax rate increased from 37.1 percent in 2001 period to 38.2 percent in the 2002 period. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower amount of tax-free interest income in the 2002 period.            Net Income.     Net income decreased 28.1% from $17,040,00 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $12,248,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002.    Years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001             Revenues.     Revenues decreased by 0.2 percent from $195,080,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $194,620,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, as a result of the decreased revenues of the Lab Support and the Healthcare Staffing segments.    24                 The Lab Support segment's revenues decreased by 0.3 percent from $139,986,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $139,558,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a 4.6 percent decrease in the number of temporary professionals on assignment from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001, partially offset by a 4.8 percent increase in average hourly billing rates during 2001. The decrease in the number of temporary professionals on assignment was primarily attributable to the overall economic slowdown beginning in February 2001.            The Healthcare Staffing segment's revenues remained relatively unchanged at $55,094,000 in the year ended December 31, 2000 and $55,062,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The consistency in revenue was primarily attributable to a 5.1 percent decrease in the number of temporary professionals on assignment, offset by a 5.8 percent increase in average hourly billing rates during 2001. The decrease in the number of temporary professionals on assignment was primarily attributable to the overall economic slowdown beginning in February 2001.            Cost of Services.     Cost of services remained relatively unchanged at $131,351,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $131,343,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The Lab Support segment's cost of services as a percentage of revenues increased by 0.2 percent from 67.1 percent in 2000 to 67.3 percent in 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to a 0.3 percent increase in workers' compensation and a 0.2 percent increase in employer paid benefits, partially offset by a 0.3 percent decrease in temporary professionals' compensation and payroll taxes in 2001. The Healthcare Staffing segment's cost of service as a percentage of revenues remained consistent at 67.9 percent in 2000 and 2001. This result was primarily attributable to a 0.3 percent increase in workers' compensation and a 0.2 percent increase in employer paid benefits, offset by a 0.5 percent decrease in temporary professionals' compensation and payroll taxes in 2001. The increase in workers' compensation expense in both segments resulted from higher insurance policy costs and an increase in actual workers' compensation claims reported and estimated incurred but not yet reported claims in 2001.            Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9.1 percent from $35,532,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $38,766,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from 18.2 percent in the 2000 period to 19.9 percent in the 2001 period. This result was primarily attributable to investments in Staffing Consultants' training and recruiting and an increase in the number of Staffing Consultants.            Interest Income.     Interest income increased 5.5 percent from $2,442,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $2,575,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily as a result of interest earned on higher interest-bearing cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities account balances in 2001, partially offset by lower interest yields earned in 2001.            Provision for Income Taxes.     Provision for income taxes decreased 11.8 percent from $11,392,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $10,046,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. Our effective tax rate decreased slightly from 37.2 percent in 2000 to 37.1 percent in 2001.            Net Income.     Net income decreased 11.5% from $19,247,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $17,040,00 for the year ended December 31, 2001.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             The change in our liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2002 is the net effect of funds generated by operations, offset by funds used in investing activities, primarily funds used for the acquisition of HPO (See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and funds used for financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we generated $20,402,000 from operations. Funds used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 were, $50,764,000,    25           including $68,815,000 used for the acquisition of HPO. Funds used for financing activities in 2002 were $3,813,000 and primarily were used for repayment of HPO debt assumed in the acquisition and repurchases of common stock. Funds used for financing activities were partially offset by funds raised through exercise of common stock options. On June 15, 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, from time to time, of up to 2,941,000 shares of On Assignment's common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 390,500 shares of our common stock on the open market at a total cost of $3,108,000. To date we have purchased 1,524,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $18,418,000.            Long-term debt totaling $5,729,000 was assumed by us in connection with our acquisition of HPO. All of this debt has been paid during 2002. The long-term liability, shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2002 of $2,572,000 is the result of an accounting treatment for deferred income taxes related to the identifiable intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of HPO and does not otherwise impact our liquidity.            In connection with our acquisition of HPO, we entered into a merger agreement dated March 27, 2002 between On Assignment, On Assignment Acquisition Corp., HPO and certain stockholders of HPO. Under the terms of the merger agreement, $15 million of the merger consideration payable to HPO was deposited in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement dated April 19, 2002 by and between On Assignment, an HPO stockholder representative and an escrow agent, with $5 million of the escrowed funds subject to recovery by On Assignment in the event that HPO failed to meet a certain revenue hurdle specified in the merger agreement for the 2002 calendar year. In January 2003, On Assignment notified the HPO Stockholder Representative that HPO did not meet the revenue hurdle and, in accordance with the merger agreement, requested that $5 million of the merger consideration be returned to On Assignment in the form of $2,500,000 in cash and $2,500,000 in shares of On Assignment's common stock (equivalent to 281,057 shares of our common stock based on a 10-day average price determined under the terms of the merger agreement). In March 2003, the HPO stockholder representative instructed the escrow agent to deliver the return amount to us. In March 2003, this amount was received.             Our working capital at December 31, 2002 was $56,996,000, including $31,990,000 in cash and cash equivalents. Our working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivables. Although we currently do not have a borrowing facility in place, we believe we have the ability to enter into a borrowing facility if and when we deem such facility appropriate. While there can be no assurances in this regard, we expect that internally-generated cash together with our borrowing ability will be sufficient to support our working capital needs and other obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.     Commitments and Contingencies             We are currently implementing a PeopleSoft enterprise wide information technology system. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we incurred approximately $3,370,000 in capital expenditures related to this project. There were no costs incurred for this project prior to 2002. We expect to incur an additional $3 million to $4 million in capital expenditures over the next 12 months related to our PeopleSoft enterprise wide information technology system, leasehold improvements and various equipment purchases.            As discussed in "Business" contained in this report, we lease space for our corporate and branch offices. During 2002, we entered into an amendment to our original lease with respect to our corporate offices located in Calabasas, California. This agreement calls for a seven-year extension of the existing lease term from March 2004 to March 2011. We have committed to base rental payments totaling $6,119,000 over the term of the agreement with the last monthly payment due on March 1, 2011. Rent    26           expense for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001, 2002 was $2,995,000, $3,895,000 and $4,784,000, respectively.             The following table sets forth, on an aggregate basis, at December 31, 2002 the amounts of specified contractual cash obligations required to be paid in the periods shown (in thousands):             2003     2004     2005     2006     2007     Thereafter     Total    Long-term debt     $       $       $       $       $       $       $      Operating leases        3,704        3,065        2,590        1,704        1,123        2,732        14,918    Capital leases                                                            Purchase obligations                                                            Other long-term liabilities                                                                                             Total contractual cash obligations     $  3,704     $  3,065     $  2,590     $  1,704     $  1,123     $  2,732     $  14,918                                        For additional information about these contractual cash obligations, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report.            We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. However, based on the facts currently available, we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a materially adverse effect on our financial position.            We are partially self-insured for workers' compensation expense. In connection with this program, we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported. We account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on actuarial reports prepared by an independent third party who reviews historical experience and current trends of industry data. Changes in estimates and differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made. The self-insurance claim liability amounted to approximately $2,662,000 and $3,048,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively.     Inflation             Inflation did not have a material impact on our operating results in 2000, 2001 or 2002.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations," and FAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." FAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for using one method, the purchase method. The provisions of FAS No. 141 apply to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The adoption of FAS No. 141 by us as of July 1, 2001 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FAS No. 142 includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. We adopted FAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2002. We completed the transitional test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the second quarter of 2002. Based on the results of this test, we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002. Pursuant to FAS No. 142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets will be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates that the assets may be impaired. We performed this test during the fourth quarter of 2002 and determined there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2002.    27                  In August 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." FAS No. 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting issues for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes FAS No. 121 but retains the fundamental provisions for (a) recognition/measurement of impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used and (b) measurement of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sales. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted FAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002. The adoption by us of FAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.            In June 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. FAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3 "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Costs to Exit and Disposal Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." FAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurements of the liability. We believe that the adoption of FAS No. 146 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.            In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FAS No. 123." FAS No. 148 amends FAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, FAS No. 148 amends the disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the methods used on reported results. The disclosure requirements apply to all companies for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the required disclosures of FAS No. 148 at December 31, 2002.    NAME="dk1256_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk                  We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business, principally risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our held to maturity investments. The interest rate risk is immaterial due to the short maturity of the majority of these investments. We are exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Based on the relative size and nature of our foreign operations, we do not believe that a ten percent change in foreign currencies would have a material impact on our financial statements.    28       NAME="page_dm1256_1_29">        NAME="dm1256_item_8._financial_statements_and_supplementary_data">      Item 8.
