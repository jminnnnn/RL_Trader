ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS          The discussion in this Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, management of growth, particularly in international markets, risks inherent in expansion into new international markets and new professions, the integration of acquired operations, the Company's ability to attract, train and retain qualified Account Managers and temporary employees in the laboratory, science, financial and environmental fields, and other risks discussed in "Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results" in Item 1 of this Annual Report, beginning on page 5, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Report and from time to time in the Company's other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  SEASONALITY          The Company's results have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations. Demand for the Company's temporary employees typically declines from the year-end holiday season through February, resulting in a corresponding decrease in revenues, operating income and net income. Demand for the Company's temporary employees also often declines in June, July and August due to decreases in clients' activity during vacation periods and the availability of students to perform temporary work. As a result, the Company has experienced slower growth or declines in revenues, operating income and net income during the first quarter and from the second quarter to third quarter of prior years.  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND 2000          REVENUES. Revenues increased by 22.3% from $159,473,000 in the year ended December 31, 1999, to $195,080,000 in the year ended December 31, 2000, as a result of the increased revenues of the Lab Support and the Healthcare Staffing segments.          The Lab Support segment's revenues increased by 17.0% from $119,668,000 in the year ended December 31, 1999, to $139,986,000 in the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a 10.6% increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment from December 31, 1999 to December 31, 2000 and to a lesser extent to a 5.2% increase in average hourly billing rates during 2000. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment was primarily attributable to the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Lab Support segment has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new offices opened in the past year.          The Healthcare Staffing segment's revenues increased by 38.4% from $39,805,000 in the year ended December 31, 1999 to $55,094,000 in the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a 36% increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment and to a lesser extent to a 5.2% increase in average hourly billing rates during 2000. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment was primarily attributable to the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Healthcare Staffing segment has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new offices opened in the past year.          COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services consists solely of compensation for temporary employees and payroll taxes, benefits and employment related expenses paid by the Company in connection with such compensation. Cost of services increased 22.0% from $107,652,000 in 1999 to $131,351,000 in 2000. The Lab Support segment's cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased by 0.4% from 67.5% in 1999 to 67.1% in 2000. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 0.9% decrease in temporary employee compensation and payroll taxes, partially offset by a 0.4% increase in workers' compensation and a 0.1% increase in employer paid benefits in 2000. The Healthcare Staffing segment's cost of service as a percentage of revenues increased by 0.4% from 67.5% in 1999 to 67.9% in 2000. This increase was attributable to an increase in workers' compensation expense. The increase in workers' compensation expense in both segments resulted from an increase in actual workers' compensation claims reported and estimated incurred but not yet reported claims in 2000.          SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with the Company's network of Account Managers and branch offices, including Account Manager compensation, rent, other office expenses and advertising for temporary employees, and corporate office expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, management compensation, Account Manager recruiting and training expenses, corporate advertising and promotion, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.8% from $30,428,000 in 1999 to                                           11    12 $35,532,000 in 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 19.1% in the 1999 period to 18.2% in the 2000 period. This result was primarily attributable to leveraging a centralized support system over a larger revenue base, offset by investments in Account Manager training and recruiting, expenses for international expansion into Europe, and an increase in the hiring of new Account Managers for the opening of new offices and the expansion of existing offices.          INTEREST INCOME. Interest income increased 49.4% from $1,635,000 in 1999 to $2,442,000 in 2000, primarily as a result of interest earned on higher interest-bearing cash, cash equivalent and marketable security account balances in 2000.          PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Provision for income taxes increased 33.0% from $8,566,000 in 1999 to $11,392,000 in 2000. The Company's effective tax rate remained unchanged at 37.2% in 1999 and 2000.  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1999          REVENUES. Revenues increased by 20.1% from $132,741,000 in the year ended December 31, 1998, to $159,473,000 in the year ended December 31, 1999, as a result of the increased revenues of the Lab Support and the Healthcare Staffing segments.          The Lab Support segment's revenues increased by 8.2% from $110,644,000 in the year ended December 31, 1998, to $119,668,000 in the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a 4.4% increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment from December 31, 1998 to December 31, 1999 and to a lesser extent to a 3.5% increase in average hourly billing rates during 1999. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment was primarily attributable to the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Lab Support segment has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new offices opened in the past year.          The Healthcare Staffing segment's revenues increased by 80.1% from $22,097,000 in the year ended December 31, 1998 to $39,805,000 in the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a 79.1% increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment and to a lesser extent to a 3.8% increase in average hourly billing rates during 1999. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment was primarily attributable to the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Healthcare Staffing segment has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new offices opened in the past year.          COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services consists solely of compensation for temporary employees and payroll taxes, benefits and employment related expenses paid by the Company in connection with such compensation. Cost of services increased 18.7% from $90,705,000 in 1998 to $107,652,000 in 1999. The Lab Support segment's cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased by 1.1% from 68.6% in 1998 to 67.5% in 1999. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 0.8% decrease in temporary employee compensation and payroll taxes and a 0.5% decrease in workers' compensation in 1999, partially offset by a 0.2% increase in employer paid benefits. The Healthcare Staffing segment's cost of service as a percentage of revenues increased by 0.5% from 67.0% in 1998 to 67.5% in 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to a 0.6% increase in temporary employee compensation and payroll taxes, and a 0.2% increase in employer paid benefits in 1999, partially offset by a 0.4% decrease in workers' compensation expense. The decrease in workers' compensation expense in both segments resulted from a decline in actual workers' compensation claims reported and estimated incurred but not yet reported claims in 1999.          SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with the Company's network of Account Managers and branch offices, including Account Manager compensation, rent, other office expenses and advertising for temporary employees, and corporate office expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, management compensation, Account Manager recruiting and training expenses, corporate advertising and promotion, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20.2% from $25,308,000 in 1998 to $30,428,000 in 1999. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues remained consistent at 19.1% in the 1998 and 1999 periods. This result was primarily attributable to leveraging a centralized support system over a larger revenue base, offset by investments in Account Manager training and recruiting, expenses for international expansion into Canada and the UK, and an increase in the hiring of new Account Managers for the opening of new offices and the expansion of existing offices.          INTEREST INCOME. Interest income increased 22.4% from $1,336,000 in 1998 to $1,635,000 in 1999, primarily as a result of interest earned on higher interest-bearing cash, cash equivalent and marketable security account balances in 1999.                                           12    13 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Provision for income taxes increased 26.9% from $6,748,000 in 1998 to $8,566,000 in 1999. The Company's effective tax rate remained relatively unchanged from 37.4% in 1998 compared to 37.2% in 1999.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The Company's primary sources of cash in 1999 and 2000 were funds provided by operating activities. In 1999, operating activities provided $10,110,000 of cash compared to $21,406,000 in 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to a higher net income, an increase in income taxes payable and a larger increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. This increase was partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable.  Cash used for investing activities totaled $7,934,000 in 1999 compared to $3,155,000 in 2000. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower purchases of marketable securities, lower purchases of furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements and a repayment of an officer loan receivable in 2000 compared to a disbursement in 1999.  Cash used for financing activities was $5,770,000 in 1999 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $8,820,000 in 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to higher proceeds from the exercise of common stock options in 2000 and repurchases of common stock in 1999.  The Company believes that its cash balances, together with the funds from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through at least the next twelve months.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company is exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business, principally risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its held to maturity investments. The interest rate risk is immaterial due to the short maturity of those investments. The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Based on the relative size and nature of its foreign operations, the Company does not believe that a ten percent change in foreign currencies would have a material impact on its financial statements.                                           13    14 ITEM 8.
