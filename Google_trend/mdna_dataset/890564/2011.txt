Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 include $7.3 million related to our Cambridge acquisition in the second quarter of 2010 and $2.6 million related to the Sharpstream acquisition in the third quarter of 2010.         Life Sciences segment revenues increased $15.8 million, or 16.9 percent, primarily due to an 11.3 percent increase in contract professionals on assignment and a $4.4 million, or 156.2 percent increase in direct hire and conversion fees. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the increase in demand for Life Sciences service offerings as our clients’ end markets have improved with the economic recovery beginning in the second quarter of 2010 and the Cambridge and Sharpstream acquisitions.         Healthcare segment revenues (comprised of our Nurse Travel and Allied Healthcare lines of business) decreased $20.9 million, or 21.5 percent. Nurse Travel revenues decreased $18.9 million, or 34.0 percent, to $36.7 million, which included $5.0 million of revenue in 2010 generated from supporting customers that experienced labor disruptions. The decrease was primarily due to a 40.6 percent decrease in the average number of nurses on assignment and a 3.6 percent decrease in the average bill rate. Allied Healthcare revenues decreased $2.0 million, or 4.7 percent, to $39.5 million due to an 11.6 percent decrease in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a $0.5 million decrease in direct hire and conversion fee revenues.  These decreases were partially offset by a 2.8 percent increase in the average bill rate. Based on our research and client feedback, we believe the decrease in revenues was attributable to continued adverse economic trends in the healthcare sector, which contributed to the decrease in number of travelers on assignment, open orders, and average bill rates. While the Allied Healthcare operating environment continued to demonstrate signs of improvement, growth was constrained by (i) a continued reduction in demand for elective procedures, (ii) a greater number of patients choosing more cost effective forms of treatment such as self-medication, (iii) hospitals reduced usage of contract professionals in response to declining cash balances and patient admissions and (iv) reduced demand for less critical allied skill modalities and a dramatic decline in demand for flu vaccine as compared to the H1N1 pandemic we faced the prior year.            26                  Physician segment revenues decreased $14.1 million, or 16.1 percent. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a 16.9 percent decrease in the average number of physicians on assignment. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.6 million, or 32.5 percent increase in direct hire revenues. The average bill rate for the Physician segment was flat. Based on industry research and client feedback, we believe the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the economic conditions and high unemployment which have reduced the number of elective procedures and lowered patient census at client facilities.         IT and Engineering segment revenues increased $40.6 million, or 29.4 percent.  The increase in revenues was primarily due to a 34.1 percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a $1.2 million increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues. These increases were partially offset by a 4.4 percent decrease in the average bill rate. Because many of our placements involve capital projects, we believe that one of the reasons the demand for our IT and Engineering services has increased with the economic recovery is that more companies have increased their capital spending.    Gross Profit and Gross Margins                Year Ended December 31,              2010            2009              Gross Profit            Gross Margin           Gross Profit          Gross Margin      GrGross Profit by segment (in thousands):           Life Sciences      $  37,776           34.5  %     $  30,470           32.5  %    Healthcare         23,058           30.2  %        27,329           28.1  %    P   Physician         23,847           32.4  %        28,545           32.5  %          IT and Engineering         64,775           36.3  %        50,024           36.2  %        Total      $  149,456           34.1  %     $  136,368           32.7  %           The year-over-year gross profit increase was primarily due to a 139 basis point expansion in consolidated gross margin and a 5.1 percent improvement in total revenue. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in the percent of revenues related to the IT and Engineering reporting unit, which has highest gross margin of all the segments and margin expansion in the Healthcare and Life Sciences segments.         Life Sciences segment gross profit increased $7.3 million, or 24.0 percent. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a 16.9 percent increase in the segment revenues and a 197 basis point expansion in gross margin. The expansion in gross margin was due to a $4.4 million, or 156.2 percent, increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues, partially offset by a 2.4 percent decrease in bill/pay spread.         Healthcare segment gross profit decreased $4.3 million, or 15.6 percent. The decrease in gross profit was due to a 21.5 percent decrease in the segment revenues, partially offset by a 210 basis point expansion in gross margin. The expansion in gross margin was primarily due to Nurse Travel revenues of $5.0 million at gross margins of 53.5 percent related to supporting customers with labor disruptions in 2010. The expansion in gross margin was partially offset by a 7.6 percent decrease in the bill/pay spread and an increase in billable expenses and workers’ compensation insurance expense. Within this segment, Allied Healthcare gross profit decreased 5.8 percent while gross margin decreased 39 basis points and Nurse Travel gross profit decreased 25.5 percent while gross margin increased 312 basis points which was primarily due to the high gross margins on supporting customers with labor disruptions in 2010 described above.         Physician segment gross profit decreased $4.7 million, or 16.5 percent. The decrease in gross profit was due to a $14.1 million, or 16.1 percent, decrease in the segment revenues as well as a 14 basis point contraction in gross margin. The contraction in gross margin was primarily due to a 3.2 percent decrease in bill/pay spread, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in direct hire revenues.         IT and Engineering segment gross profit increased $14.8 million, or 29.5 percent. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a $40.6 million, or 29.4 percent increase in revenues.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses include field operating expenses, such as costs associated with our network of staffing consultants and branch offices for each of our four segments, including staffing consultant compensation, rent, other office expenses, marketing and recruiting expenses for our contract professionals. SG&A expenses also include our corporate and branch office support expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, recruiting and training expenses for field staff, marketing staff expenses, expenses related to being a publicly-traded company and other general and administrative expenses.       For the year ended December 31, 2010, SG&A expenses increased $9.7 million, or 8.0 percent, to $130.8 million from $121.1 million for the same period in 2009. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $12.9 million increase in compensation and benefits. The increase in compensation and benefits was due to a $9.4 million increase in bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation as a result of increased revenue and the attainment of incentive compensation targets as well as a $3.2 million increase in compensation expenses as a result of increased headcount related to the Cambridge and Sharpstream acquisitions. The increase in SG&A expenses was also due to a $0.9 million increase in travel expenses for acquisition-related activities in 2010. The increase in SG&A expenses was partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in amortization expense as certain intangible assets became fully amortized in the first quarter of 2010. Total SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 29.9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 29.1 percent in the same period in 2009.          Impairment of Goodwill.  We recognized   a goodwill impairment charge of $15.4 million related to Nurse Travel during 2010. The goodwill impairment charge for Nurse Travel was a result of the decreased fair value of the reporting unit due to lowered growth expectations in the later years because of uncertainty regarding the timing of the recovery of the Nurse Travel industry.              27             Interest Expense and Interest Income.     Interest expense was $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $6.6 million in 2009.  This increase was primarily due to the write-off of unamortized capitalized loan costs of $2.8 million related to the old borrowing facility that was paid in full in December 2010 as well as a $1.3 million gain in 2009 for the mark-to-market adjustment on our interest rate swap, which expired on June 30, 2009, partially offset by lower average debt balances in 2010.         Interest income decreased to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $0.2 million in 2009 due to lower account balances invested in interest-bearing accounts and lower average interest rates.    Provision for Income Taxes.  The provision for income taxes was $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $4.1 million in 2009.  Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 47.4 percent in 2010 compared with 46.4 percent in 2009.    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008    Revenues.                Year Ended December 31,            Change              2009            2008           $           %    Revenues by segment (in thousands):                Life Sciences      $  93,664        $  129,483        $  (35,819  )        (27.7%)         Healthcare         97,137           180,671           (83,534  )        (46.2%)         Physician         87,719           89,217           (1,498  )        (1.7%)         IT and Engineering         138,093           218,687           (80,594  )        (36.9%)    Total      $  416,613        $  618,058        $  (201,445  )        (32.6%)      Revenues decreased $201.4 million, or 32.6 percent, as a result of weakened demand for our services in all segments.    Life Sciences segment revenues decreased $35.8 million, or 27.7 percent. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a 24.8 percent decrease in the average number of contract professionals on assignment, as well as a $3.4 million, or 54.8 percent decrease in direct hire and conversion fees. Based on our research and client feedback, we believe this was a direct result of our clients’ decisions to focus more on cost containment than on completing projects and developing new products or enhancing existing product lines during this challenging economic period, decreased venture capital funding in the life sciences sector, softness in the clinical trials arena, which is closely tied to the struggling pharmaceutical industry, decreased demand for recent graduates and lower level scientific skill disciplines.    Healthcare segment revenues (comprised of our Nurse Travel and Allied Healthcare lines of business) decreased $83.5 million, or 46.2 percent. Nurse Travel revenues decreased $69.4 million, or 55.5 percent, to $55.6 million primarily as a result of a 51.1 percent decrease in the average number of nurses on assignment and a 3.4 percent decrease in the average bill rate. Allied Healthcare revenues decreased $14.1 million, or 25.3 percent, to $41.5 million due to a 21.1 percent decrease in the average number of contract professionals on assignment, partially offset by a 6.5 percent increase in the average bill rate. Based on our research and client feedback, we believe the decrease in revenues was attributable to less demand from hospitals and other healthcare facilities as they reduced their usage of contract professionals in response to declining patient admissions, endowment balances, reduced charitable contributions and the inability to access the credit markets during this challenging economic period.    Physician segment revenues decreased $1.5 million, or 1.7 percent. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a 13.2 percent decrease in the average number of physicians on assignment and a $0.9 million decrease in reimbursable revenue for billable expenses, partially offset by a 2.3 percent increase in the average bill rate.  Based on industry research and client feedback, we believe the decrease in revenues reflects the uncertainty surrounding health care reform and the decline in patient admissions which has slowed down our clients’ hiring decisions.            28             IT and Engineering segment revenues decreased $80.6 million, or 36.9 percent.  The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a 31.8 percent decrease in the average number of contract professionals on assignment, an 8.8 percent decrease in the average bill rate and a $3.7 million decrease in reimbursable revenue for billable expenses.  Based on client feedback, the decrease in revenues was mainly the result of the current economic environment and the lack of capital available to clients for projects and programs.    Gross Profit and Gross Margins.                Year Ended December 31,              2009            2008              Gross Profit            Gross Margin               Gross Profit        Gross Margin      Gross Profit by segment (in thousands):           Life Sciences      $  30,470           32.5  %     $  43,502           33.6  %    Healthcare         27,329           28.1  %        46,265           25.6  %    Physician         28,545           32.5  %        27,369           30.7  %    IT and Engineering         50,024           36.2  %        82,320           37.6  %    Total      $  136,368           32.7  %     $  199,456           32.3  %      The year-over-year gross profit decrease was primarily due to the decline in revenues in all four segments, partially offset by a 46 basis point expansion in consolidated gross margin. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to margin expansion in the Healthcare and Physician segments and a shift in mix from our Nurse Travel line of business which has the lowest gross margin.    Life Sciences segment gross profit decreased $13.0 million, or 30.0 percent. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a 27.7 percent decrease in the segment revenues and a 107 basis point contraction in gross margin mainly due to a $3.4 million decrease in direct hire and conversion fee revenues. The contraction in gross margin was partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in workers’ compensation expense as a result of both lower claim frequency and favorable settlements.    Healthcare segment gross profit decreased $18.9 million, or 40.9 percent. The decrease in gross profit was due to a 46.2 percent decrease in the segment revenues, partially offset by a 252 basis point expansion in gross margin. The expansion in gross margin was primarily due to a 117 basis point decrease in travel related expenses, an 88 basis point reduction in other employee-related expenses and a 38 basis point decrease in workers’ compensation expense as a result of our loss control efforts. The expansion in gross margin was partially offset by an 8.5 percent decrease in the bill/pay spread. Within this segment Allied Healthcare gross profit decreased 22.4 percent while gross margin expanded 123 basis points and Nurse Travel gross profit decreased 52.4 percent while gross margin increased 160 basis points.    Physician segment gross profit increased $1.2 million, or 4.3 percent. The increase in gross profit was attributable to a 186 basis point expansion in gross margin, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in revenue. The expansion in gross margin was primarily due to a 6.9 percent increase in the bill/pay spread as well as a $0.9 million increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues. The expansion in gross margin was partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in medical malpractice expense, which included a $0.6 million non-cash expense related to the Company’s adjustment of the discount rate applied to our medical malpractice liability because of the decrease in interest rates.    IT and Engineering segment gross profit decreased $32.3 million, or 39.2 percent, primarily due to a 36.9 percent decrease in revenues and a contraction in gross margin of 142 basis points.  The contraction in gross margin was primarily due to an 11.3 percent decrease in the bill/pay spread and a $1.0 million decrease in direct hire and conversion fee revenues.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   SG&A expenses decreased $34.8 million, or 22.3 percent, to $121.1 million from $155.9 million. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $23.9 million decrease in compensation and benefits as a result of lower  headcount as compared with the prior year.  The decrease in SG&A expenses was also due to a $3.4 million decrease in amortization expense as certain intangible assets became fully amortized beginning in late 2008, as well as a $2.2 million decrease in travel related expense and a $1.4 million decrease in marketing expense. Total SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 29.1 percent in the 2009 period from 25.2 percent in the same period in 2008, primarily due to revenue decreasing faster than SG&A expenses in 2009.            29             Interest expense and interest income.   Interest expense was $6.6 million in 2009 compared with $10.0 million in 2008.  This decrease was primarily due to a $1.3 million gain in 2009 compared with a $0.1 million loss in 2008 for the mark-to-market adjustment on our interest rate swap, which expired on June 30, 2009 and lower average debt balances, partially offset by higher interest rates as a result of the debt amendment completed in the first quarter of 2009.    Interest income was $0.2 million and $0.7 million for the years ended 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest income in the current period decreased compared to 2008 due to lower account balances invested in interest-bearing accounts and lower average interest rates.    Provision for Income Taxes . The provision for income taxes was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with $15.3 million for 2008. The annual effective tax rate for 2009 was 46.4 percent compared with 44.6 percent for 2008. The increase in the annual effective tax rate was attributable to a decline in the income before income taxes for the year while our level of permanent differences was comparable with 2008.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    Our working capital at December 31, 2010 was $50.6 million and our cash and cash equivalents were $18.4 million. Our operating cash flows have been our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs. Our working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivable, payroll expenses and the periodic payments of principal and interest on our loans.    Net cash provided by operating activities was $26.9 million for 2010 compared with $42.0 million for 2009.  The 2009 period benefited from a significant reduction in accounts receivable of $28.0 million versus an increase of $10.5 million in 2010. These fluctuations in accounts receivable were primarily responsible for the significantly reduced operating cash flows in 2010 compared to 2009. This reduction was partially offset by increased cash flows resulting from an increase in accrued payroll and contract professional pay.    Net cash used in investing activities was $16.6 million during 2010 compared with $13.8 million during 2009. Cash paid for acquisitions was approximately $10.5 million and capital expenditures for information technology projects, leasehold improvements and various property and equipment purchases increased $1.6 million to $6.3 million in 2010. We estimate that capital expenditures for 2011 will be approximately $7.4 million.    Net cash used in financing activities was $16.6 million for 2010, compared with $49.0 million in 2009.  During 2010, principal payments of long-term debt were $79.2 million versus $48.0 million paid down during 2009. On December 3, 2010, we replaced our existing credit facility with a new senior secured credit agreement, which consists of a $50.0 million, five-year term loan facility, a $75.0 million, five-year revolving loan facility and a $10.0 million sublimit for letters of credit, as well as the ability to increase the loan facilities for up to an additional $50.0 million, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of specified conditions. This resulted in debt amendment costs of $1.9 million that will be amortized over the life of the new loan. Proceeds from the new loan facility were $68.0 million.      Finally, the Board of Directors approved the repurchase of $20.0 million worth of our common stock over a four-year period, of which, 291,212 shares were purchased in November 2010 at a total cost of $2.0 million.         Under terms of the new credit facility, the term loan facility is repayable at the minimum rate of $1.3 million per quarter and we are required to reduce the term loan by up to 50 percent of our excess cash flow based on leverage ratios, as defined by the agreement for each year end over the next five years. We are required to maintain certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Additionally, the agreement, which is secured by substantially all of our assets, provides for certain limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, offer loans, declare dividends and incur capital expenditures.    We continue to make progress on enhancements to our front-office and back-office information systems.  These enhancements include the consolidation of back-office systems across all corporate functions, as well as enhancements to and broader application of our front-office software across all lines of business. The timing of the full integration of information systems used by VISTA and Oxford will remain a consideration of management.            30             We believe that our working capital as of December 31, 2010, our new credit facility and positive operating cash flows expected from future activities will be sufficient to fund future requirements of our debt repayment obligations, accounts payable and related payroll expenses as well as capital expenditure initiatives for the next twelve months.    Commitments and Contingencies    We lease space for our corporate and branch offices. Rent expense was $8.4 million in 2010, $8.2 million in 2009 and $9.5 million in 2008.    The following table sets forth, on an aggregate basis, at December 31, 2010, the amounts of specified contractual cash obligations required to be paid in the periods shown (in thousands):        Contractual Obligations       2011          2012          2013          2014          2015          Thereafter          Total                                                                      Long-term debt obligations      $  5,000        $  5,000        $  5,000        $  5,000        $  46,750        $  ―        $  66,750    Operating lease obligations         5,260           5,242           5,692           5,925           5,129           10,366           37,614       Total      $  10,260        $  10,242        $  10,692        $  10,925        $  51,879        $  10,366        $  104,364                                                                                            For additional information about these contractual cash obligations, see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Interest payments related to our bank debt are not set forth in the table above.    As of December 31, 2010, included in other current assets is a balance of $0.3 million for claims indemnifiable by the selling shareholders of VISTA, which we anticipate will be settled by the agreement of all applicable parties to the terms and provisions related to such payment in 2011.    We are partially self-insured for our workers' compensation liability related to the Life Sciences, Healthcare and IT and Engineering segments as well as the medical malpractice liability related to the Physician segment. In connection with this program, we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported. We account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data. Changes in estimates, differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made. The self-insurance claim liability was approximately $10.2 million and $10.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Additionally, we have unused stand-by letters of credit outstanding to secure obligations for workers’ compensation claims with various insurance carriers.  The unused stand-by letters of credit at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $2.8 million and $3.8 million, respectively.    As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we have an income tax reserve in other long-term liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions of $0.3 million.    We are involved in various other legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. However, based on the facts currently available, we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    As of December 31, 2010, the Company had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and unused stand-by letters of credit outstanding.        Accounting Standards Updates     In January 2010, the FASB issued an update to ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  (ASC 820), which requires new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements. More specifically, this update will require (a) an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers; and (b) information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements to be presented separately (i.e. present the activity on a gross basis rather than net) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). This guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosure requirements related to the purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the rollforward activity of Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements, which will be effective in the quarter ended March 31, 2011.            31             In September 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , which establishes the criteria for separating consideration in multiple-element arrangements.  The updated guidance requires companies allocating the overall consideration to each deliverable to use an estimated selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor-specific evidence or other third-party evidence of the selling price for the deliverables and it also provides additional factors that should be considered when determining whether software in a tangible product is essential to its functionality. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2011 with no impact to the consolidated financial statements.    In August 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 820   on measuring liabilities at fair value. The updated guidance provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted market price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, an entity is required to measure fair value using a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset or, if unavailable, quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar assets when traded as assets. If none of this information is available, an entity should use a valuation technique in accordance with existing fair valuation principles. We adopted the measurement requirements of this guidance in the quarter ended December 31, 2010 with no impact on the consolidated financial statements.        Critical Accounting Policies     Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Billing Adjustments.  We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts as well as an allowance for billing adjustments related to trade receivables based on our analysis of historical collection and adjustment experience. We apply actual collection and adjustment percentages to the outstanding accounts receivable balances at the end of the period. Impaired receivables, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible. If we experience a significant change in collections or billing adjustment experience, our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change by a material amount.    Workers’ Compensation and Medical Malpractice Loss Reserves.  We are partially self-insured for our workers’ compensation liability related to the Life Sciences, Healthcare and IT and Engineering segments as well as our medical malpractice liability in relation to the Physician segment. In connection with these programs, we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred, not to exceed certain stop-loss limits. We are insured for losses above these limits, both per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported. We account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data. Changes in estimates and differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or the payments were made.    Contingencies.  We record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies, such as legal settlements, workers’ compensation matters and medical malpractice insurance matters, requires us to use our judgment. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss, results of operations may be over or understated.    Income taxes.  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.            32             We make a comprehensive review of our uncertain tax positions regularly.  In this regard, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. In general, until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities or statutes expire for the year that the position was taken, we do not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and report the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in our consolidated balance sheets.    Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets.  Goodwill and other intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not amortized for financial statement purposes. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of December 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.    Intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of trademarks.  In order to test the trademarks for impairment, we determine the fair value of the trademarks and compare such amount to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of the trademarks using a projected discounted cash flow analysis based on the relief-from-royalty approach. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are projected net sales, discount rate, royalty rate and terminal value assumption. The royalty rate used in the analysis is based on transactions that have occurred in our industry.  Intangible assets having finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are reviewed to ensure that no conditions exist indicating the recorded amount is not recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows.    Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit.  This first step is a screen for impairment and compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value.  We determine the fair value based upon discounted cash flows prepared for each reporting unit. Cash flows are developed for each reporting unit based on assumptions including revenue growth expectations, gross margins, operating expense projections, working capital, capital expense requirements and tax rates. The multi-year financial forecasts for each reporting unit used in the cash flow models considered several key business drivers such as new product lines, historical performance and industry and economic trends, among other considerations.  The second step measures the amount of impairment by comparing the fair value of the impacted reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.  The fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.  As part of the second step, we calculated the fair value of certain assets including tradenames, staffing databases and customer relationships. To determine the fair value of goodwill, fair values were allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit which failed the first step. The fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities.  The impairment loss was measured by the amount the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the fair value of goodwill.    The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations, discount rate, and terminal value assumptions. The discount rate is determined using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).  The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of an average market participant’s capital structure (equity and debt).  It also considers our risk-free rate of return, equity market risk premium, beta and size premium adjustment. A single discount rate is utilized across each reporting unit since we do not believe that there would be significant differences by reporting unit.  Additionally, the selection of the discount rate accounts for any uncertainties in the forecasts.  The terminal value assumptions are applied subsequent to the tenth year of the discounted cash flow model.    For purposes of establishing inputs for the estimated fair value calculations described above, we applied annual revenue growth rates based on the then current economic and market conditions and a terminal growth rate of 4.0 percent. These growth factors were applied to each reporting unit for the purpose of projecting future cash flows. The cash flows as of December 31, 2009 were discounted at a rate of approximately 16.9 percent. We performed a review of market-based data to perform the step one analysis as part of our annual impairment test. The market data review included a comparable trading multiple analysis based on public company competitors in the staffing industry. The market analysis was performed on a consolidated basis to assess the reasonableness of the results of the discounted cash flow analysis. The market analysis was performed on a consolidated basis because we did not believe that there were direct competitors with publicly available financial data that were comparable to each of our reporting units.  Based on this analysis, the fair value determination based on the discounted cash flow model was determined to be reasonable in comparison to the fair values derived from these other valuation methods.  Except as noted, no other impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was determined to exist as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.      We performed the step one analyses for each reporting unit as of December 31, 2010 as this is our annual impairment test date. We noted no impairment for any of the reporting units as of December 31, 2010, except for the Nurse Travel reporting unit. The discount rate that was used was 14.0 percent. We performed a review of market-based data to perform the step one analysis as part of our annual impairment test. The market data review included a comparable trading multiple analysis based on public company competitors in the staffing industry. The market analysis was performed on a consolidated basis to assess the reasonableness of the results of the discounted cash flow analysis.  Based on this analysis, the fair value determination based on the discounted cash flow model was determined to be reasonable in comparison to the fair values derived from these other valuation methods.               33               We determined in the step one analysis that the fair value of the Nurse Travel reporting unit was lower than its carrying value.  While we began to experience growth in the Nurse Travel business during the fourth quarter, the decrease in the value was due to lowered growth expectations in the later years due to uncertainty regarding the timing of the recovery of the Nurse Travel industry. In addition, we performed a market-based analysis for the Nurse Travel reporting unit, which included a comparable trading multiple analysis based on public company competitors in the staffing industry.  This analysis arrived at a fair value comparable with the fair value derived from the discounted cash flow model and further supported the impairment of goodwill.  We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $15.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.    The Physician reporting unit’s revenues met the forecasted amounts in the fourth quarter of 2010 and revenue is forecasted to stabilize the first half of 2011 for the Physician reporting unit and revenue growth rates in the years beginning 2012 reflect a recovery from the recession.  The revenue growth rates are within the range of historical growth rates we have previously experienced during economic recoveries.  In addition, we performed a market-based analysis for the Physician reporting unit, which included a comparable trading multiple analysis based on public company competitors in the staffing industry.  We averaged the results of discounted cash flow model and the market-analysis which showed no indicator of impairment for the Physician reporting unit.   As of December 31, 2010, the Physician reporting unit represented 18.6 percent of our $199.7 million goodwill balance and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as determined by the average of the discounted cash flow analysis and the market-based analysis exceeded the carrying value by 54.5 percent.      The discounted cash flows and the resulting fair value estimates of our reporting units are highly sensitive to changes in other assumptions which include an increase of less than 300 basis points in the discount rate and/or a less than 22.0 percent decline in the cash flow projections of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain significant reporting units to be below their carrying value.  Additionally, we have assumed that there will be an economic recovery at the beginning of 2012 for the Physician reporting unit. Changes in the timing of the recovery and the impact on our operations and costs may also affect the sensitivity of the projections including achieving future cost savings resulting from initiatives which contemplate further synergies from system and operational improvements in infrastructure and field support which were included in our forecasts.  Ultimately, future changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value, which would require a step two analysis and may result in impairment of goodwill.    Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of recorded goodwill, changes in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis. Downward revisions of our forecasts, extended delays in the economic recovery, or a sustained decline of our stock price resulting in market capitalization significantly below book value could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives in future periods.    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.   We evaluate long-lived assets, other than goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, in which case a write-down is recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value.  There was no impairment of long-lived assets as of December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.          Business Combinations .   The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is allocated to goodwill. We determine the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices and estimates made by management. Accordingly, these can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.          Goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit(s) expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.  Acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred.      Stock-Based Compensation.   We record compensation expense for restricted stock awards and stock units based on the fair market value of the awards on the date of grant. Market-based awards, which are based on achievement of targets indexed to our share price, are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model.  Compensation expense for performance-based awards is measured based on the amount of shares ultimately expected to vest, estimated at each reporting date based on management’s expectations regarding the relevant performance criteria.  We account for stock options granted and ESPP shares based on an estimated fair market value using a Black- Scholes option valuation model.  This methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award.  The fair value of equity-based compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award.     Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk      We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business, principally risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates. We are exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Based on the relative size and nature of our foreign operations, we do not believe that a ten percent change in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would have a material impact on our financial statements.              34                  Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt instruments. See “Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further description of our debt instruments. The interest rate swap that we entered into with a financial institution on May 2, 2007 expired as of June 30, 2009 in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Prior to the expiration of the interest rate swap on June 30, 2009, the Company entered into a one-year interest rate cap contract effective July 1, 2009, in order to mitigate the interest rate risk as required by the prior credit facility agreement. The interest rate cap contract was for a notional amount of $51.0 million with a one-month LIBOR cap of 3.0 percent. The interest rate cap agreement expired on July 1, 2010. Prior to its expiration, the interest rate cap contract had the effect of capping the effective one month LIBOR rate at 3.0 percent. Following the expiration of the interest rate cap agreement, the fair value of the long-term debt effectively became subject to market interest rate volatility until such time that the credit facility was replaced with a new senior secured credit agreement on December 3, 2010.    Under our new credit agreement and as of December 31, 2010, we had $66.8 million in principal amount of variable-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $66.8 million based on the fact that the debt agreement had only been in place for twenty-nine days.  Given the limited time outstanding during the last part of the year, it has been determined that the carrying value of the debt approximates its fair value. We have the option to determine the variable interest rate as the Eurodollar rate or the base rate (which is the highest of the bank’s prime rate, one-half of 1.0 percent in excess of the overnight federal funds rate, and 1.0 percent in excess of the one-month Eurodollar rate), plus in each case, an applicable margin. Additionally, the new credit agreement required that we enter into, and maintain for at least three years, an interest rate hedge by March 2, 2011.  Accordingly, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on February 18, 2011, which is outlined more fully in this report in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.    Excluding the effect of our interest rate swap agreement, a hypothetical 1.0 percent change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately $0.7 million based on $66.8 million of debt outstanding for any twelve month period. Including the effect of our interest rate swap agreement, a 1.0 percent change in interest rates on variable debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately $0.7 million based on $66.8 million of debt outstanding for any twelve month period.    We have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes.                   35                Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
