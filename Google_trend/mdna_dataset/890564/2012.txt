Results of Operations       The following table summarizes selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues:                  Year Ended December 31,               2011          2010          2009        Revenues         100.0   %        100.0    %        100.0   %    Cost of services         66.5           65.9           67.3       Gross profit         33.5           34.1           32.7       Selling, general and administrative expenses         26.1           29.9           29.1       Impairment of goodwill         -           3.5           -       Operating income         7.4           0.7           3.7       Interest expense         (0.5  )        (1.9  )        (1.6  )    Interest income         -           -           -       Income (loss) before income taxes         6.9           (1.2  )        2.1       Provision for income taxes         2.9           1.1           1.0       Net income (loss)         4.1   %        (2.3  ) %        1.1   %     * Columns may not foot due to rounding.              21                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010       Revenues                   Year Ended December 31,          Change            2011          2010          $           %    Revenues by segment (in thousands):                                             Life Sciences      $  155,324        $  109,495        $  45,829           41.9%         Healthcare         94,598           76,287           18,311           24.0 %        Physician         80,617           73,595           7,022           9.5 %        IT and Engineering         266,742           178,688           88,054           49.3 %    Total      $  597,281        $  438,065        $  159,216           36.3 %          Revenues increased $159.2 million, or 36.3 percent, mainly due to growth in all four segments which was partially due to our acquisitions of Cambridge, Sharpstream, Valesta and HCP. Cambridge and Sharpstream were acquired in 2010 ,  Valesta was acquired during the first quarter of 2011 and HCP was acquired on July 31, 2011. Cambridge is reported under the Life Sciences, IT and Engineering and Physician segments; Sharpstream and Valesta are reported under the Life Sciences segment and HCP is reported under the Physician segment. Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $48.1 million related to our Cambridge, Sharpstream, Valesta and HCP acquisitions compared with $9.9 million related to the Cambridge and Sharpstream acquisitions in 2010.     Life Sciences segment revenues increased $45.8 million, or 41.9 percent, comprised of a $42.4 million increase in staffing revenues and a $3.4 million, or 46.7 percent increase in direct hire and conversion fees. The increase in staffing revenues resulted from a 29.1 percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a 7.8 percent increase in average bill rate. The year-over-year increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased demand for our service offerings as our clients’ end markets have improved in 2011 with the progressing economic recovery and an increase in revenues of $24.8 million from the business acquired in 2010 and 2011.     Revenues for our Healthcare segment (comprised of our Nurse Travel and Allied Healthcare lines of business) increased $18.3 million, or 24.0 percent. The increase in revenues in the Healthcare segment was attributable to improved economic trends in the healthcare sector, which contributed to the increase in the number of contract professionals on assignment, open orders and average bill rates and supporting customers who were undergoing system conversions. Although the Healthcare segment remains soft, we continue to see signs of improvement in demand. Nurse Travel revenues increased $12.9 million, or 35.1 percent, to $49.6 million, comprised of a 29.5 percent increase in the average number of nurses on assignment and a 2.0 percent increase in the average bill rate. Revenues related to staffing resulting from labor disruptions at customer sites included $7.1 million in 2011 and $5.0 million in 2010. Allied Healthcare revenues increased $5.4 million, or 13.7 percent, to $45.0 million, comprised of a 5.9 percent increase in average number of contract professionals on assignment and a 2.5 percent increase in the average bill rate. The Allied Healthcare operating environment continued to demonstrate signs of improvement as economic trends in our end markets showed signs of stabilization and growth as evidenced by year-over-year growth in the number of contractors and clients on billing, average bill rate, permanent placement activity and billable hours.         Physician segment revenues increased $7.0 million, or 9.5 percent, comprised of a 16.5 percent increase in the average number of physicians on assignment, a 1.9 percent decrease in average bill rate and a $0.3 million, or 8.5 percent decrease in direct hire and conversion fees revenue Physician segment revenues for year ended December 31, 2011 included $11.4 million related to our HCP and Cambridge acquisitions. The legacy physician staffing business decreased year over year. We attribute this to continued uncertainty related to healthcare reform, fewer physicians deciding to retire, current economic conditions and high unemployment which have reduced the number of elective procedures and lowered patient census at client facilities.    IT and Engineering segment revenues increased $88.1 million, or 49.3 percent, comprised of a 41.0 percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a 5.8 percent increase in average bill rate. The increase in revenue was also due to a $0.9 million, or 46.4 percent increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues. IT and Engineering segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $4.3 million in revenue from our Cambridge acquisition in April 2010, compared with $2.2 million in 2010. Because many of our placements involve capital projects, we believe that one of the reasons the demand for our services has increased with the progressing economic recovery is that more companies have increased their capital spending.                 22               Gross Profit and Gross Margins                             Year Ended December 31,            2011       2010            Gross Profit          Gross Margin       Gross Profit          Gross Margin     Gross Profit by segment (in thousands):                                         Life Sciences      $  52,643           33.9   %     $  37,776           34.5   %    Healthcare         26,637           28.2   %        23,058           30.2   %    Physician         25,858           32.1   %        23,847           32.4   %    IT and Engineering         94,967           35.6   %        64,775           36.3   %    Total      $  200,105           33.5   %     $  149,456           34.1   %         The year-over-year gross profit increase was primarily due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by a 62 basis point contraction in consolidated gross margin. The contraction in gross margin was primarily due to margin contraction in the Healthcare and IT and Engineering segments.         Life Sciences segment gross profit increased $14.9 million, or 39.4 percent. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a 41.9 percent increase in revenues, offset by a 61 basis point contraction in gross margin. The contraction in gross margin was mainly due to a benefit in 2010 from employment tax credits related to the HIRE Act, which expired on December 31, 2010, higher European payroll tax rates and holiday pay related to Valesta employees and an increase in unemployment insurance expenses. This contraction was partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues mainly from our Sharpstream acquisition and an 11.4 percent increase in bill/pay spread.     Healthcare segment gross profit increased $3.6 million, or 15.5 percent. The increase in gross profit was due to a 24.0 percent increase in revenues, partially offset by a 207 basis point contraction in gross margin. The contraction in gross margin was mainly due to an abnormally high gross margin in Nurse Travel in 2010, related to supporting a customer with labor disruptions when we did not have to have nurses travel and thus the related costs, a $1.8 million increase in travel related expenses, a $1.9 million increase in other employee expenses, and a $0.7 million increase in unemployment insurance expense. The contraction in gross margin was partially offset by an 8.1 percent increase in bill/pay spread. Within this segment, Allied Healthcare gross profit increased 11.0 percent while gross margin decreased 77 basis points and Nurse Travel gross profit increased 21.3 percent while gross margin decreased 283 basis points.         Physician segment gross profit increased $2.0 million, or 8.4 percent. The increase in gross profit was due to a $7.0 million, or 9.5 percent, increase in revenues, partially offset by a 32 basis point contraction in gross margin. The contraction in gross margin was primarily due to a 7.0 percent decrease in bill/pay spread, in part a result of the acquisition of HCP which has a higher concentration of lower gross margin government business, and a $0.3 million, or 8.5 percent decrease in direct hire revenue and conversion fee revenues, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in medical malpractice insurance expense primarily due to favorable claims development.     IT and Engineering segment gross profit increased $30.2 million, or 46.6 percent, primarily due to an $88.1 million, or 49.3 percent, increase in revenues, partially offset by a 65 basis point contraction in gross margin. The contraction in gross margin was in part due to a $4.7 million, or 35.2 percent, increase in other employee expenses, and a benefit in 2010 from employment tax credits related to the HIRE Act, which expired on December 31, 2010, partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues and a 5.0 percent increase in bill/pay spread.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses include field operating expenses, such as costs associated with our network of staffing consultants and branch offices for each of our four segments, including staffing consultant compensation, rent, other office expenses, marketing and recruiting expenses for our contract professionals. SG&A expenses also include our corporate and branch office support expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, recruiting and training expenses for field staff, marketing staff expenses, expenses related to being a publicly-traded company and other general and administrative expenses.     For the year ended December 31, 2011, SG&A expenses increased $24.9 million, or 19.0 percent, to $155.7 million in 2011. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $20.1 million, or 21.1 percent, increase in compensation and benefits. The increase in compensation and benefits was due to (i) an $11.7 million increase in compensation expenses primarily as a result of increased headcount related to the Cambridge, Sharpstream, Valesta and HCP acquisitions and headcount additions to support anticipated high growth in certain segments, (ii) an $8.4 million increase in bonuses and commissions as a result of increased revenue and the anticipated attainment of incentive compensation targets, and (iii) a $0.5 million increase in acquisition costs primarily related to the recent acquisitions. Additionally, non-compensation and benefits related SG&A expenses increased $2.9 million as a result of the Valesta and HCP acquisitions which were both completed in 2011. This increase in SG&A expenses was partially offset by a $1.9 million gain related to the settlements of the Cambridge earn-out and Sharpstream earn-out. Total SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 26.1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with 29.9 percent in the same period in 2010.         Impairment of Goodwill.  We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $15.4 million related to Nurse Travel during 2010. The goodwill impairment charge for Nurse Travel was a result of the decreased fair value of the reporting unit due to lowered growth expectations in the later years because of uncertainty regarding the timing of the recovery of the Nurse Travel industry.        Interest Expense.  Interest expense was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $8.3 million in 2010. This decrease was related to the $2.8 million write-off of unamortized capitalized loan costs in 2010, related to the old borrowing facility that was paid in full in December 2010, as well as lower interest rates in 2011.                23               Provision for Income Taxes.  The provision for income taxes was $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $5.0 million in 2010. The annual effective tax rate was 41.4 percent for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 47.4 percent in 2010 excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge. The decrease in the tax rate in 2011 was primarily related to the year-over-year increase in income before income taxes for 2011 while permanent differences increased, but not as much as the increase to the income before income taxes, which lowered the annual effective rate. Refer to Note 8 for detailed information reconciling the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate.      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009       Revenues                    Year Ended December 31,            Change             2010            2009            $        %     Revenues by segment (in thousands):            Life Sciences        $    109,495            $    93,664            $    15,831        16.9%     Healthcare            76,287                97,137                (20,850    )    (21.5%)     Physician            73,595                87,719                (14,124    )    (16.1%)     IT and Engineering            178,688                138,093                40,595        29.4%     Total        $    438,065            $    416,613            $    21,452        5.1%           Revenues increased $21.5 million, or 5.1 percent, as a result of improved operating environments in our IT and Engineering and Life Sciences segments and our acquisitions of Cambridge and Sharpstream, offset by continued weak demand for our services in our Healthcare and Physician segments. Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 include $7.3 million related to our Cambridge acquisition in the second quarter of 2010 and $2.6 million related to the Sharpstream acquisition in the third quarter of 2010.     Life Sciences segment revenues increased $15.8 million, or 16.9 percent, primarily due to an 11.3 percent increase in contract professionals on assignment and a $4.4 million, or 156.2 percent increase in direct hire and conversion fees. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the increase in demand for Life Sciences service offerings as our clients’ end markets have improved with the economic recovery beginning in the second quarter of 2010 and the Cambridge and Sharpstream acquisitions.     Healthcare segment revenues (comprised of our Nurse Travel and Allied Healthcare lines of business) decreased $20.9 million, or 21.5 percent. Nurse Travel revenues decreased $18.9 million, or 34.0 percent, to $36.7 million, which included $5.0 million of revenue in 2010 generated from supporting customers that experienced labor disruptions. The decrease was primarily due to a 40.6 percent decrease in the average number of nurses on assignment and a 3.6 percent decrease in the average bill rate. Allied Healthcare revenues decreased $2.0 million, or 4.7 percent, to $39.5 million due to an 11.6 percent decrease in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a $0.5 million decrease in direct hire and conversion fee revenues. These decreases were partially offset by a 2.8 percent increase in the average bill rate. Based on our research and client feedback, we believe the decrease in revenues was attributable to continued adverse economic trends in the healthcare sector, which contributed to the decrease in number of travelers on assignment, open orders, and average bill rates. While the Allied Healthcare operating environment continued to demonstrate signs of improvement, growth was constrained by (i) a continued reduction in demand for elective procedures, (ii) a greater number of patients choosing more cost effective forms of treatment such as self-medication, (iii) hospitals reduced usage of contract professionals in response to declining cash balances and patient admissions and (iv) reduced demand for less critical allied skill modalities and a dramatic decline in demand for flu vaccine as compared to the H1N1 pandemic we faced the prior year.     Physician segment revenues decreased $14.1 million, or 16.1 percent. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a 16.9 percent decrease in the average number of physicians on assignment. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.6 million, or 32.5 percent increase in direct hire revenues. The average bill rate for the Physician segment was flat. Based on industry research and client feedback, we believe the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the economic conditions and high unemployment which have reduced the number of elective procedures and lowered patient census at client facilities.     IT and Engineering segment revenues increased $40.6 million, or 29.4 percent. The increase in revenues was primarily due to a 34.1 percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a $1.2 million increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues. These increases were partially offset by a 4.4 percent decrease in the average bill rate. Because many of our placements involve capital projects, we believe that one of the reasons the demand for our IT and Engineering services has increased with the economic recovery is that more companies have increased their capital spending.         Gross Profit and Gross Margins                    Year Ended December 31,             2010            2009             Gross Profit            Gross Margin            Gross Profit       Gross Margin     Gross Profit by segment (in thousands):            Life Sciences        $    37,776                34.5    %        $    30,470                32.5    %     Healthcare            23,058                30.2    %            27,329                28.1    %     Physician            23,847                32.4    %            28,545                32.5    %     IT and Engineering            64,775                36.3    %            50,024                36.2    %     Total        $    149,456                34.1    %        $    136,368                32.7    %           The year-over-year gross profit increase was primarily due to a 139 basis point expansion in consolidated gross margin and a 5.1 percent improvement in total revenue. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in the percent of revenues related to the IT and Engineering reporting unit, which has highest gross margin of all the segments and margin expansion in the Healthcare and Life Sciences segments.             24             Life Sciences segment gross profit increased $7.3 million, or 24.0 percent. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a 16.9 percent increase in the segment revenues and a 197 basis point expansion in gross margin. The expansion in gross margin was due to a $4.4 million, or 156.2 percent, increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues, partially offset by a 2.4 percent decrease in bill/pay spread.     Healthcare segment gross profit decreased $4.3 million, or 15.6 percent. The decrease in gross profit was due to a 21.5 percent decrease in the segment revenues, partially offset by a 210 basis point expansion in gross margin. The expansion in gross margin was primarily due to Nurse Travel revenues of $5.0 million at gross margins of 53.5 percent related to supporting customers with labor disruptions in 2010. The expansion in gross margin was partially offset by a 7.6 percent decrease in the bill/pay spread and an increase in billable expenses and workers’ compensation insurance expense. Within this segment, Allied Healthcare gross profit decreased 5.8 percent while gross margin decreased 39 basis points and Nurse Travel gross profit decreased 25.5 percent while gross margin increased 312 basis points which was primarily due to the high gross margins on supporting customers with labor disruptions in 2010 described above.     Physician segment gross profit decreased $4.7 million, or 16.5 percent. The decrease in gross profit was due to a $14.1 million, or 16.1 percent, decrease in the segment revenues as well as a 14 basis point contraction in gross margin. The contraction in gross margin was primarily due to a 3.2 percent decrease in bill/pay spread, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in direct hire revenues.     IT and Engineering segment gross profit increased $14.8 million, or 29.5 percent. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a $40.6 million, or 29.4 percent increase in revenues.     Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses include field operating expenses, such as costs associated with our network of staffing consultants and branch offices for each of our four segments, including staffing consultant compensation, rent, other office expenses, marketing and recruiting expenses for our contract professionals. SG&A expenses also include our corporate and branch office support expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, recruiting and training expenses for field staff, marketing staff expenses, expenses related to being a publicly-traded company and other general and administrative expenses.     For the year ended December 31, 2010, SG&A expenses increased $9.7 million, or 8.0 percent, to $130.8 million from $121.1 million for the same period in 2009. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $12.9 million increase in compensation and benefits. The increase in compensation and benefits was due to a $9.4 million increase in bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation as a result of increased revenue and the attainment of incentive compensation targets as well as a $3.2 million increase in compensation expenses as a result of increased headcount related to the Cambridge and Sharpstream acquisitions. The increase in SG&A expenses was also due to a $0.9 million increase in travel expenses for acquisition-related activities in 2010. The increase in SG&A expenses was partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in amortization expense as certain intangible assets became fully amortized in the first quarter of 2010. Total SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 29.9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 29.1 percent in the same period in 2009.         Impairment of Goodwill.  We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $15.4 million related to Nurse Travel during 2010. The goodwill impairment charge for Nurse Travel was a result of the decreased fair value of the reporting unit due to lowered growth expectations in the later years because of uncertainty regarding the timing of the recovery of the Nurse Travel industry.        Interest Expense and Interest Income.  Interest expense was $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $6.6 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the write-off of unamortized capitalized loan costs of $2.8 million related to the old borrowing facility that was paid in full in December 2010 as well as a $1.3 million gain in 2009 for the mark-to-market adjustment on our interest rate swap, which expired on June 30, 2009, partially offset by lower average debt balances in 2010.          Interest income decreased to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $0.2 million in 2009 due to lower account balances invested in interest-bearing accounts and lower average interest rates.     Provision for Income Taxes.  The provision for income taxes was $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $4.1 million in 2009. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 47.4 percent in 2010 compared with 46.4 percent in 2009.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       Our working capital at December 31, 2011 was $74.7 million and our cash and cash equivalents were $17.7 million, of which $6.8 million was held in foreign countries. Cash held in foreign countries are not available to fund domestic operations unless repatriated, which would require the accrual and payment of taxes. We do not intend to repatriate cash held in foreign countries. Our operating cash flows have been our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs. Our working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivable, payroll expenses and the periodic payments of principal and interest on our loans.         Net cash provided by operating activities was $23.4 million for 2011 compared with $26.9 million for 2010. Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 were primarily driven by income from operations, an increase in accrued payroll and contract professional pay, offset by an increase in accounts receivable. Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 were primarily driven by income from operations, a decrease in prepaid income taxes and an increase in accrued payroll and contract professional pay, offset by an increase in accounts receivable.         Net cash used in investing activities was $41.1 million during 2011 compared with $16.6 million during 2010. Cash paid for acquisitions was approximately $32.8 million and capital expenditures for information technology projects, leasehold improvements and various property and equipment purchases increased $2.1 million to $8.4 million in 2011. We estimate that capital expenditures for 2012 will be approximately $8 million.         Net cash provided by financing activities was $17.5 million for 2011, compared with $16.6 million used in financing activities in 2010. During 2011, principal payments of long-term debt were $20.5 million, versus $79.2 million paid down during 2010. Proceeds from new borrowings on the term loan and line of credit were $40.5 million and $68.0 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.            25              Under terms of the credit facility, the term loan facility is repayable at the minimum rate of $1.3 million per quarter and we are required to reduce the term loan by up to 50 percent of our excess cash flow based on leverage ratios, as defined by the agreement for each year end over the next five years. We are required to maintain certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Additionally, the agreement, which is secured by substantially all of our assets, provides for certain limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, offer loans, declare dividends and incur capital expenditures.         We continue to make progress on enhancements to our front-office and back-office information systems. These enhancements include the consolidation of back-office systems across all corporate functions, as well as enhancements to and broader application of our front-office software across all lines of business.        We believe that our working capital as of December 31, 2011, our credit facility and positive operating cash flows expected from future activities will be sufficient to fund future requirements of our debt repayment obligations, accounts payable and related payroll expenses, as well as capital expenditure initiatives for the next twelve months.       Commitments and Contingencies       We lease space for our corporate and branch offices. Rent expense was $8.6 million in 2011, $8.4 million in 2010 and $8.2 million in 2009.         The following table sets forth, on an aggregate basis, at December 31, 2011, the amounts of specified contractual cash obligations required to be paid in the periods shown (in thousands):            Contractual Obligations        2012            2013            2014            2015            2016            Thereafter            Total                                                                                          Long-term debt obligations        $    5,000            $    5,000            $    5,000            $    71,750            $    ―            $    ―            $    86,750     Operating lease obligations            7,028                6,079                5,558                4,955                3,203                5,954                32,777        Total        $    12,028            $    11,079            $    10,558            $    76,705            $    3,203            $    5,954            $    119,527           For additional information about these contractual cash obligations, see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Interest payments related to our bank debt are not set forth in the table above.         We are partially self-insured for our workers' compensation liability related to the Life Sciences, Healthcare and IT and Engineering segments as well as the medical malpractice liability related to the Physician segment. In connection with this program, we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported. We account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data. Changes in estimates, differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made. The self-insurance claim liability was approximately $10.4 million and $10.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Additionally, we have unused stand-by letters of credit outstanding to secure obligations for workers’ compensation claims with various insurance carriers. The unused stand-by letters of credit at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $2.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively.         As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we have an income tax reserve in other long-term liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions of $0.3 million.         We are involved in various other legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. However, based on the facts currently available, we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.    We are subject to earn-out obligations entered into in connection with acquisitions. If the acquired businesses meet predetermined targets, we are obligated to make additional cash payments in accordance with the terms of such earn-out obligations. At December 31, 2011, the Company has potential future earn-out obligations of approximately $10.2 million through 2013.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and unused stand-by letters of credit outstanding.       Accounting Standards Updates       See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.               26             Critical Accounting Policies       Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.         Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Billing Adjustments.  We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts as well as an allowance for billing adjustments related to trade receivables based on our analysis of historical collection and adjustment experience. We apply actual collection and adjustment percentages to the outstanding accounts receivable balances at the end of the period. Impaired receivables, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible. If we experience a significant change in collections or billing adjustment experience, our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change by a material amount.         Workers’ Compensation and Medical Malpractice Loss Reserves.  We are partially self-insured for our workers’ compensation liability related to the Life Sciences, Healthcare and IT and Engineering segments as well as our medical malpractice liability related to the Physician segment. In connection with these programs, we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred, not to exceed certain stop-loss limits. We are insured for losses above these limits, both per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported. We account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data. Changes in estimates and differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or the payments were made.         Contingencies.  We record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies, such as legal settlements, workers’ compensation matters and medical malpractice insurance matters, requires us to use our judgment. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss, results of operations may be over or understated.         Income taxes.  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.         We make a comprehensive review of our uncertain tax positions regularly. In this regard, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. In general, until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities or statutes expire for the year that the position was taken, we do not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and report the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in our consolidated balance sheets.         Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets.  Goodwill and other intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not amortized for financial statement purposes. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of December 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.         Intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of trademarks. In order to test the trademarks for impairment, we determine the fair value of the trademarks and compare such amount to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of the trademarks using a projected discounted cash flow analysis based on the relief-from-royalty approach. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are projected net sales, discount rate, royalty rate and terminal value assumption. The royalty rate used in the analysis is based on transactions that have occurred in our industry. Intangible assets having finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are reviewed to ensure that no conditions exist indicating the recorded amount is not recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. We did not have any impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles in 2011, 2010, or 2009.        Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit, which is generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management. This first step is a screen for impairment and compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit based upon a weighted average calculation using the fair value derived from a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach analysis. Discounted cash flows are developed for each reporting unit based on assumptions including revenue growth expectations, gross margins, operating expense projections, working capital, capital expense requirements and tax rates. The multi-year financial forecasts for each reporting unit used in the cash flow models considered several key business drivers such as new product lines, historical performance and industry and economic trends, among other considerations. The market approach considers multiples of financial metrics, primarily EBITDA, based on trading multiples of a group of guideline public companies in the staffing industry, which multiples are then applied to the corresponding financial metrics of our reporting units to derive an indication of fair value.    If after performing the first step of the impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed its carrying value, we perform a second step for that reporting unit. The second step measures the amount of goodwill impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the impacted reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined under the same approach utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. This approach requires we allocate the fair value of the impacted reporting unit as calculated in the first step of the goodwill impairment test to the reporting unit assets, including identifiable intangible assets, which typically includes tradenames, staffing databases and customer relationships, and liabilities, based on the estimated fair values of such assets and liabilities, with any excess reporting unit fair value representing the implied fair value of goodwill for that reporting unit. The reporting unit goodwill impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill calculated in the second step of the goodwill impairment test.              27               The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations, discount rate, and terminal value assumptions. The discount rate is determined using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of an average market participant’s capital structure (equity and debt). It also considers our risk-free rate of return, equity market risk premium, beta and size premium adjustment. A single discount rate is utilized across each reporting unit since we do not believe that there would be significant differences by reporting unit. Additionally, the selection of the discount rate accounts for any uncertainties in the forecasts. The terminal value assumptions are applied subsequent to the tenth year of the discounted cash flow model.        We performed the step one analyses for each reporting unit as of December 31, 2011 as this is our annual impairment test date. No impairment was noted for any of the reporting units as of December 31, 2011. The fair value of all reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by approximately 30 percent or more. The discount rate used in the cash flow analysis was 14.6 percent.           We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $15.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Goodwill for the Company’s impaired reporting unit, Nurse Travel, with a carrying amount of $15.4 million was written down to the implied fair value of $0 resulting in an impairment charge of $15.4 million. There was no goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2009, based upon the analysis as of that date.        The discounted cash flows and the resulting fair value estimates of our reporting units are sensitive to changes in other assumptions which includes an increase of less than 10 percent in the discount rate of a reporting unit. Such change could cause the fair value of certain significant reporting units to be below their carrying value. Additionally, we have assumed that there will be an economic recovery at the beginning of 2012 for the Physician reporting unit. Changes in the timing of the recovery and the impact on our operations and costs may also affect the sensitivity of the projections including achieving future cost savings resulting from initiatives which contemplate further synergies from system and operational improvements in infrastructure and field support which were included in our forecasts. Ultimately, future changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value, which would require a step two analysis and may result in impairment of goodwill.         Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of recorded goodwill, changes in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis. Downward revisions of our forecasts, extended delays in the economic recovery, or a sustained decline of our stock price resulting in market capitalization significantly below book value could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives in future periods.         Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  We evaluate long-lived assets, other than goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, in which case a write-down is recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value. There was no impairment of long-lived assets as of December 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009.     Business Combinations.  The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is allocated to goodwill. We determine the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices and estimates made by management. Accordingly, these can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.       Goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit(s) expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred.       Stock-Based Compensation.  We record compensation expense for restricted stock awards and stock units based on the fair market value of the awards on the date of grant. Market-based awards, which are based on achievement of targets indexed to our share price, are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense for performance-based awards is measured based on the amount of shares ultimately expected to vest, estimated at each reporting date based on management’s expectations regarding the relevant performance criteria. We account for stock options granted and ESPP shares based on an estimated fair market value using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity-based compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award.       Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk       We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business, principally risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates. We are exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Based on the relative size and nature of our foreign operations, we do not believe that a ten percent change in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would have a material impact on our financial statements. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt instruments. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further description of our debt instruments.    On May 2, 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap with a financial institution, which expired on June 30, 2009 in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Prior to the expiration of the interest rate swap on June 30, 2009, the Company entered into a one-year interest rate cap contract effective July 1, 2009, in order to mitigate the interest rate risk as required by the prior credit facility agreement. The interest rate cap contract was for a notional amount of $51.0 million with a one-month LIBOR cap of 3.0 percent. The interest rate cap agreement expired on July 1, 2010. Prior to its expiration, the interest rate cap contract had the effect of capping the effective one month LIBOR rate at 3.0 percent. Following the expiration of the interest rate cap agreement, the fair value of the long-term debt effectively became subject to market interest rate volatility until such time that the credit facility was replaced with a new senior secured credit agreement on December 3, 2010.    On February 18, 2011, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement to hedge a portion of our interest rate exposure on our senior secured credit agreement. The swap has a notional amount of $25.0 million and fixes a portion of our base borrowing rate,   which is a floating rate based on a LIBOR swap rate that resets periodically.            28             As of December 31, 2011, we had $86.8 million of principal outstanding under the senior secured credit agreement, $61.8 million of which bears interest at variable-rates. We have the option to determine the variable interest rate as the Eurodollar rate or the base rate (which is the highest of the bank’s prime rate, one-half of 1.0 percent in excess of the overnight federal funds rate, and 1.0 percent in excess of the one-month Eurodollar rate), plus in each case, an applicable margin.     Excluding the effect of our interest rate swap agreement, a hypothetical 1.0 percent change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately $0.9 million based on $86.8 million of debt outstanding for any twelve month period. Including the effect of our interest rate swap agreement, a 1.0 percent change in interest rates on variable debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately $0.6 million based on $86.8 million of debt outstanding for any twelve month period.     We have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes.                       29               Item 8.
