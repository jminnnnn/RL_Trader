Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations              Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements regarding our expected financial position and operating results, our business strategy and financing plans are forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from its expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include those discussed in this report under "BusinessRisk Factors," which we encourage you read.   Overview             On Assignment, Inc. is a leading provider of skilled temporary professionals to clients in the healthcare and science industries. We provide our clients in these markets with short-term or long-term assignments of temporary professionals and temporary-to-permanent placement of these professionals. Our business consists of two operating segments: Healthcare Staffing and Lab Support. Through our Healthcare Staffing segment, we are able to offer our clients temporary professionals, both locally-based and traveling, from more than ten healthcare and medical financial occupations. These temporary professional specialties include nurses, specialty nurses, surgical technicians, imaging technicians, x-ray technicians, medical technicians, medical technologists, phlebotomists, coders, billers, claims processors and collectors. Through our Lab Support segment, we service the domestic and international markets for science professionals and provide temporary and temporary-to-permanent placement of scientific personnel to industrial laboratories in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, personal care, chemical and environmental industries. In 2003, we expanded our service offerings to include engineering, clinical research, respiratory therapy, licensed vocational nurses and traditional 13-week nurse travel assignments.            Healthcare Staffing segment revenues represented approximately 56 percent of our total revenues for 2003, up slightly from 55 percent in 2002 and up from 28 percent in 2001. The significant increase in our Healthcare Staffing segment revenues from 2001 to 2002 was principally due to our acquisition of Health Personnel Options Corporation (HPO) in April 2002. The acquisition of HPO put us much closer towards our goal of being a "full-service" provider to our healthcare clients. Through this acquisition, we were able to enter the travel nurse and travel allied healthcare industries, supplement our locally based allied temporary professionals and become a more comprehensive partner to our healthcare clients.            Consolidated revenues for 2003 were $209,554,000 down 16 percent from $250,313,000 in 2002. We experienced a challenging year in 2003 as a result of a decrease in demand for our services and increased competition. Reduced Lab Support demand was influenced by recent periods of reduced economic activity, which resulted in lower needs for laboratory workers in research and development and quality control functions. In Healthcare Staffing, many hospitals and health maintenance organizations took nurse-staffing actions that temporarily decreased the demand for travel nurses, including increased overtime for their full-time nurses, increased ratios of patients to nurses, and higher compensation for full-time nurse positions. We also believe the weaker economy induced part-time nurses to work additional hours, nurses to delay retirement and retired nurses to re-enter the workforce, which temporarily increased the supply of nurses available to work. As demand decreased for the overall staffing industry, we experienced intensified competition from both national and international staffing firms as well as from smaller, privately-held organizations.            Given the decline in revenue experienced by our respective segments, our primary focus during 2003 was on cost containment, including headcount reductions of 72 employees and 18 branch office closings. These efforts were undertaken to streamline our organization and better align our resources and cost structure with our anticipated revenue opportunities and to preserve our cash and cash equivalent balances. We also placed emphasis on preserving our reputation for quality, service and    24          reliability. Throughout the year we continued the upgrades of our infrastructure, primarily by advancing the implementation of PeopleSoft, an enterprise wide information system. Along the way, we added efficiency to both our external and internal operations, and with the automation, we have greatly reduced our dependence on internal manual processes.             Since the hiring of Peter T. Dameris as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in November 2003, our senior management team has been focused on developing a solid revitalization plan to grow revenues and our market share. This plan was built from the bottom up, market by market by analyzing each of our staffing service offerings. The plan was approved by our Board of Directors on February 12, 2004, and we are now aggressively implementing the plan. The plan is centered on improving our sales capabilities, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and depth of our operations management. We are also focused on completing the company-wide implementation of our PeopleSoft ERP system and on training our field staff to improve automation and efficiency. In addition, we have tactically hired skilled industry veterans to augment our already experienced field management team.             Our revitalization plan includes the expected hiring of 24 incremental sales and fulfillment personnel in Local Healthcare, 22 in Lab Support and 10 in Nurse Travel. Local Healthcare continues to be our most challenged line of business while Nurse Travel and Lab Support stabilized in the fourth quarter of 2003. Another area of particular focus in 2004 will be the reduction of travel and housing costs at Nurse Travel and Allied Travel to improve our gross profit margins. The plan also provides for upgraded training and mentoring of new and existing personnel. Each new hire has specific productivity and revenue quotas that, if achieved, will permit us to post positive revenue growth on a year over year basis. However, due to the timing of resource investments associated with our revitalization plan and the current performance of Local Healthcare, at this time we do not expect to generate positive net income for the full 2004 year.    Seasonality             Our results of operations have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations. From November through February, revenues, operating income and net income in both our Healthcare Staffing and Lab Support segments, have been negatively impacted by fewer business days and the fall off of the number of temporary professionals willing to work during the holiday period. In particular, many of our temporary professionals who like travel assignments often end their assignments before the holiday season in December to spend time with family and friends. As is common in the staffing industry, we run special incentive programs to keep our temporary professionals, particularly nurses, working through the holidays. Additionally, demand for our temporary professionals in our Lab Support segment also often declines in June, July and August due to decreases in clients' activity during vacation periods and the availability of students to perform temporary work.    Critical Accounting Policies             Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.    25                  Allowance For Doubtful Accounts.     We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables based on our analysis of specific accounts and historical collection experiences applied to the remaining general accounts. For specific accounts, we use our judgment, based on available facts, circumstances and conversations with clients (or the lack thereof), to record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected. For the remaining accounts, a general reserve is established based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories. These percentages are based on historical collection experience. If circumstances change, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could change by a material amount.            Accrued Workers' Compensation.     We are partially self-insured for workers' compensation expense. The workers' compensation program covers all of our temporary professionals and regular employees. In connection with this program, we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported. In order to ensure that the accrued workers' compensation balance is adequate to cover all costs incurred under our workers' compensation program, at the end of each fiscal quarter, an actuarial report is prepared by an independent third party who calculates our self-insurance claim liability based on historical experience and trends of industry data. If historical experiences and industry trends change, the self-insurance claim liability calculated by the third-party actuary could change by a material amount.            Contingencies.     We account for contingencies in accordance with FAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." FAS No. 5 requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies such as legal and workers' compensation matters requires us to use our judgment. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss, results of operations may be over or understated.            Goodwill and Identifiable Intangibles.     As discussed in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" as of January 1, 2002. FAS No. 142 requires, subsequent to January 1, 2002, that we review and test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, rather than amortize them. We may be required to review and test for impairment more frequently if an event occurs that indicates that the assets may be impaired. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, FAS 142 requires us to: (1) allocate goodwill to our various businesses to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of those businesses to which goodwill relates; and (3) determine the carrying value of the businesses. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular business, then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires independent valuations of certain internally generated and previously unrecognized intangible assets. When this process is completed, the amount of goodwill impairment will be determined.             With respect to our goodwill impairment testing, the fair market value of our reporting units was estimated by us using the income approach, which utilizes forecasted discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value. Judgments and assumptions about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business and significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results. Although we believe the judgments and assumptions used in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate, there is nonetheless a high degree of uncertainty and judgment involved.    26                  We concluded at June 30, 2003 that significant events had occurred for purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis, requiring us to perform an analysis prior to our next regularly scheduled impairment testing date, December 31, 2003, to determine whether the recorded goodwill balance was impaired. The fair market value was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit. Based on this comparison, we determined that the goodwill related to one of the reporting units in the Healthcare Staffing segment was impaired. We recognized an impairment charge of $79,897,000 during the second quarter of 2003. At December 31, 2003, we performed another analysis on our remaining goodwill balance of $43,538,000, and we determined there was no further impairment of goodwill. We will continue to evaluate goodwill for further impairment as required under FAS No. 142.    Results of Operations             The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues:             Year Ended December 31,             2001     2002     2003             (Unaudited)         Revenues:     100.0  %  100.0  %  100.0  %    Cost of services     67.5     70.5     73.2                           Gross profit     32.5     29.5     26.8       Selling, general and administrative expenses     19.9     21.8     28.4       Impairment of goodwill               38.1                           Operating income (loss)     12.6     7.7     (39.7  )    Interest income, net     1.3     0.2     0.2                           Income (loss) before income taxes     13.9     7.9     (39.5  )    Provision (benefit) for income taxes     5.1     3.0     (0.5  )                        Net income (loss)     8.8  %  4.9  %  (39.0  )%                           Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2003             Revenues.     Revenues decreased $40,759,000 or 16.3 percent from $250,313,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $209,554,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Revenue resulting from our acquisition of HPO was $94,563,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002 and $91,954,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, our 2003 revenue decreased 24.5 percent or $38,150,000 compared to year ended December 31, 2002.            Lab Support segment's revenues decreased $19,206,000 or 17.1 percent from $112,118,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $92,912,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a 22.8 percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment and a 26.2 percent decrease in conversion fee revenue from $2,232,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $1,648,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 were adversely impacted by reduced client demand for our temporary professionals, particularly in the biotechnology sector, due to a slow down in research and development and quality control spending caused by the weak economy. In addition, we experienced intensified competition from both national and international staffing firms as well as from smaller, privately-held organizations. Our conversion fee revenue was lower as fewer temporary professionals were converted into permanent employees, primarily due to the weak economy and increased competition. Decreased Lab Support segment revenues were partially offset by a 6.1 percent increase in average billing rates during the year ended December 31, 2003 due to an increase in bill rates and favorable exchange rates.    27                  Healthcare Staffing segment's revenues decreased by $21,553,000 or 15.6 percent from $138,195,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $116,642,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Revenues resulting from our acquisition of HPO decreased 2.8 percent from $94,563,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002 to $91,954,000 for the full year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease in revenue was due to a 23.8 percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on travel assignments as demand was negatively impacted as many hospitals took actions that temporarily decreased the demand for travel nurses, given their higher costs, as well as intensified competition and lower patient censuses. In addition, we were negatively impacted by a shift in the mix of business to "all-inclusive" billing from the direct billing of reimburseable travel and housing expenses without a corresponding increase in average bill rates. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, revenue decreased 43.4 percent from $43,632,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $24,688,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a 48.0 percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment and a 41.3 percent decrease in conversion fee revenue from $665,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $391,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, other than revenues related to HPO, were adversely impacted by lower client demand for our temporary professionals due to weak economic conditions, increased competition, and high turnover and loss of market share. Our conversion fee revenue was lower as fewer temporary professionals were converted into permanent employees, primarily due to the weak economy and increased competition. Decreased Healthcare Staffing revenues were partially offset by a 4.9 percent increase in average billing rates in the 2003 period primarily due to a change in product mix and an increase in bill rates.            Cost of Services.     Cost of services consists solely of temporary professionals' compensation, payroll taxes, benefits, housing expense, travel expense and other employment-related expenses. Cost of services decreased $23,139,000 or 13.1 percent from $176,520,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $153,381,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Cost of services attributable to the HPO acquisition increased by 3.2 percent from $71,033,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002 to $73,289,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in cost of services for HPO were primarily due to an increase in compensation, incentives, workers' compensation and state unemployment insurance related to our temporary professionals. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, cost of services decreased 24.1 percent or $25,395,000 from $105,487,000 for the 2002 period to $80,092,000 for the 2003 period. The cost of services as a percentage of revenues increased by 2.7 percent from 70.5 percent in the 2002 period to 73.2 percent in the 2003 period. This increase was primarily attributable to a 2.4 percent increase in temporary professionals' compensation and payroll taxes, a .2 percent increase in HPO travel and housing expenses, and .1 percent net increase in workers' compensation expense.            The Lab Support segment's cost of services as a percentage of segment revenues increased by .2 percent from 67.9 percent in the 2002 period to 68.1 percent in the 2003 period. This increase was primarily attributable to a 1.2 percent increase in temporary professionals' compensation and payroll taxes, partially offset by a .4 percent decrease in employer paid benefits and a .6 percent decrease in workers' compensation expense.            The Healthcare Staffing segment's cost of services as a percentage of segment revenues increased by 4.6 percent from 72.7 percent in the 2002 period to 77.3 percent in the 2003 period. This increase was primarily attributable to 3.3 percent increase in temporary professionals' compensation and payroll taxes, a .7 percent increase in workers' compensation expense, .4 percent increase in employer paid benefits, and .2 percent increase in HPO travel and housing expenses.             Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with our network of Staffing Consultants and branch offices for Lab Support and Local Healthcare Staffing, including Staffing Consultants' compensation, rent, other office expenses and advertising for temporary professionals. For Nurse Travel and Allied Travel, selling, general and    28          administrative expenses include compensation for Regional Sales Directors, Account Managers and Recruiters as well as rent, other office expenses and advertising for temporary professionals who desire to travel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include our corporate and support office expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, recruiting and training expenses for field staff, corporate advertising and promotion, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4,760,000 or 8.7 percent from $54,675,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $59,435,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. In 2003, selling, general and administrative expenses also included approximately $1,687,000 in connection with the reduction in personnel and branch office closures. In addition, we incurred higher staff compensation expenses, higher expenses related to the implemention of PeopleSoft (including hosting fees and depreciation expense), increased insurance fees and consulting fees and the amortization of Identifiable intangibles related to the HPO acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the HPO acquisition were $17,593,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002 and $19,352,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from 21.8 percent for the 2002 period to 28.4 percent in the 2003 period primarily due to higher fixed operating expenses relative to revenue and costs associated with our headcount reductions and branch office closures.            Impairment of Goodwill.     Based on our impairment analysis at June 30, 2003, we concluded that goodwill, related to one of our reporting units in the Healthcare Staffing segment, was impaired. As required by FAS No. 142, in measuring the amount of goodwill impairment, we made a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the tangible and intangible assets (other than goodwill) of the reporting unit. Based on this allocation, we concluded that $79,897,000 of recorded goodwill was impaired. The goodwill impairment has been expensed as a non-cash charge to continuing operations during the second quarter of 2003. At December 31, 2003, we performed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no further impairment of goodwill. We will continue to evaluate goodwill for further impairment as required under FAS No. 142.            Interest Income.     Interest income, net, decreased 44.0 percent from $700,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $392,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of lower interest rates and lower average balances in our interest bearing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities account balances due primarily to cash used in the April 2002 HPO acquisition.            Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes.     Provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased from $7,570,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, to a benefit of $(967,000) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our effective tax rate was 1.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 38.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2002. The difference in our tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared with the corresponding period of 2002 was primarily due to the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment recognized in the 2003 period. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment, the effective tax rate would have been 33.7 percent for 2003. This represents a decrease from 38.2 percent in 2002 primarily due to permanent non-deductible differences, the effect of international operations and an adjustment to our state tax receivable balance.    Years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002             Revenues.     Revenues increased $55,693,000 or 28.6 percent from $194,620,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $250,313,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenue resulting from our acquisition of HPO was $94,563,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, our 2002 revenue decreased 20.0 percent or $38,870,000 compared to year ended December 31, 2001.    29                 Lab Support segment's revenues decreased $27,440,000 or 19.7 percent from $139,558,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $112,118,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a 20.4 percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment and a 40.5 percent decrease in permanent placement fee revenue from $3,751,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $2,232,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were adversely impacted by lower needs for our temporary professionals, particularly in the biotechnology sector, due to a slow down in research and development and quality control spending caused by the weak economy. In addition, we experienced intensified competition from both national and international staffing firms as well as from smaller, privately-held organizations. Decreased Lab Support segment revenues were partially offset by a 1.4 percent increase in average billing rates during the year ended December 31, 2002.            Healthcare Staffing segment's revenues increased by $83,133,000 or 151.0 percent from $55,062,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $138,195,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenues resulting from our acquisition of HPO were $94,563,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, revenue decreased 20.8 percent from $55,062,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $43,632,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a 24.0 percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, other than revenues related to HPO, were adversely impacted by lower needs for our temporary professionals due to weak economic conditions, increased competition and internal operational challenges, including high turnover and under-representation in certain markets. Decreased Healthcare Staffing revenues were partially offset by a 16.3 percent increase in permanent placement fee revenue from $572,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $665,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a 9.0 percent increase in average billing rates in the 2002 period.             Cost of Services.     Cost of services consists solely of temporary professionals' compensation, payroll taxes, benefits, housing expense, travel expense and other employment-related expenses. Cost of services increased $45,177,000 or 34.4 percent from $131,343,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $176,520,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Cost of services attributable to the HPO acquisition was $71,033,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, cost of services decreased 19.7 percent or $25,856,000 from $131,343,000 for the 2001 period to $105,487,000 for the 2002 period. The cost of services as a percentage of revenues increased by 3.0 percent from 67.5 percent in the 2001 period to 70.5 percent in the 2002 period. The Lab Support segment's cost of services as a percentage of segment revenues increased by .6 percent from 67.3 percent in the 2001 period to 67.9 percent in the 2002 period. This increase was primarily attributable to a .7 percent increase in employer paid benefits and a .1 percent increase in workers' compensation expense, partially offset by a .2 percent decrease in temporary professionals' compensation and payroll taxes. The Healthcare Staffing segment's cost of services as a percentage of segment revenues increased by 4.8 percent from 67.9 percent in the 2001 period to 72.7 percent in the 2002 period. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of HPO, which has a higher cost of services than the other divisions within the Healthcare Staffing segment, partially offset by a 4.9 percent decrease in temporary professionals' compensation and payroll taxes, a .2 percent decrease in employer paid benefits and a .2 percent decrease in workers' compensation expense.            Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with our network of Staffing Consultants and branch offices, including Staffing Consultants' compensation, rent, other office expenses and advertising for temporary professionals. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include our corporate and support office expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, recruiting and training expenses for Staffing Consultants, corporate advertising and promotion, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $15,909,000 or 41.0 percent from    30          $38,766,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $54,675,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the HPO acquisition were $17,593,000 for the period April 19, 2002 through December 31, 2002. Excluding the effect of the HPO acquisition, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4.3 percent or $1,684,000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from 19.9 percent for the 2001 period to 21.8 percent in the 2002 period primarily due to our internal investments in our business and infrastructure in 2002 and higher fixed operating expenses relative to revenue.            Interest Income.     Interest income, net, decreased 72.8 percent from $2,575,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $700,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of lower interest rate yields earned during the 2002 period on lower interest bearing cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities account balances, primarily due to cash used in the HPO acquisition, and interest expense of $100,000 incurred in 2002 as a result of debt acquired in the HPO acquisition.            Provision for Income Taxes.     Provision for income taxes decreased 24.6 percent from $10,046,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $7,570,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Our effective tax rate increased from 37.1 percent in 2001 period to 38.2 percent in the 2002 period. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower amount of tax-free interest income in the 2002 period.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             Our operating cash flows are our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs. Our working capital at December 31, 2003 was $53,258,000, including $35,134,000 in cash and cash equivalents. Our working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivable and related payroll expenses. Although we currently do not have a borrowing facility in place, we believe we have the ability to enter into a borrowing facility if and when we deem such facility appropriate.            Because we rely on cash flows from operations as our primary source of liquidity, we are subject to the risk that a decrease in demand for our staffing services could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. However, as we demonstrated in 2003, our business model allows us to rapidly adapt to challenging business conditions. Given the decline in revenue experienced by our respective segments during 2003, our primary focus was on cost containment, including headcount reductions of 72 employees and 18 branch office closings. During 2003, we expensed $1,687,000 in costs related to these headcount reductions and branch office closings. These efforts were undertaken to streamline our organization and better align our resources and cost structure with our anticipated revenue opportunities and to preserve our cash and cash equivalent balances. For 2003, we generated positive operating cash flow of $6,248,000, and we increased our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances by $1,144,000. We expect the growth of our businesses may result in increased working capital needs in order to finance increases in accounts receivable and related payroll expenses.            We expect to incur an additional $4,000,000 to $4,500,000 in capital expenditures over the next 12 months related to our PeopleSoft enterprise wide information technology system, leasehold improvements and various equipment purchases. We maintain considerable control over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures and believe we would be able to adjust these expenditures if the need arose.            Funds used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $221,000, which primarily consisted of the acquisition of property and equipment, proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities and proceeds for the recovery of the HPO escrow. Funds used for financing activities in 2003 were $4,262,000 which consisted primarily of funds used for repurchases of common stock partially offset by funds raised through the exercise of common stock options and proceeds from    31          the Employee Stock Purchase Program. On June 15, 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, from time to time, of up to 2,941,000 shares of On Assignment's common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we repurchased 1,138,500 shares of our common stock on the open market at a total cost of $4,552,000. To date, we have purchased 2,662,500 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $22,970,000.            Long-term liabilities shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheet were $2,641,000 at December 31, 2002, compared to $1,450,000 at December 31, 2003. Deferred income taxes of $1,159,000 for year ended December 31, 2003 accounts for 79.9 percent of long-term liabilities. The increase in long-term liabilities is primarily the result of deferred income taxes related to the identifiable intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of HPO. The remaining $291,000 represents deferred rent expense.             Pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement dated March 27, 2002 between On Assignment, On Assignment Acquisition Corp., HPO and certain stockholders of HPO, $15,000,000 of the merger consideration payable to HPO was deposited in escrow with $5,000,000 of the escrowed funds subject to recovery by On Assignment in the event that HPO failed to meet a certain revenue hurdle for the 2002 calendar year. In January 2003, On Assignment notified the HPO stockholder representative that HPO did not meet the revenue hurdle and, in accordance with the merger agreement, requested that $5,000,000 of the merger consideration be returned to On Assignment in the form of $2,500,000 in cash and $2,500,000 in shares of On Assignment's common stock (equivalent to 281,057 shares of our common stock based on a 10-day average price determined under the terms of the merger agreement). In March 2003, this amount was returned to us.            As described under "Overview" and "BusinessGrowth Strategy" above, we are currently implementing a revitalization plan that was approved by our Board of Directors on February 12, 2004. The plan involves improving our sales capabilities, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and depth of our sales operations management. Our revitalization plan includes the expected hiring of 24 incremental sales and fulfillment personnel in Local Healthcare, 22 in Lab Support and 10 in Nurse Travel. The plan also provides for upgraded training and mentoring of new and existing personnel. Each new hire has specific productivity and revenue quotas that we believe, if achieved, will permit us to post positive revenue growth on a year over year basis. However, due to the timing of resource investments associated with our revitalization plan and the current performance of our Local Healthcare division, at this time we do not expect to generate positive net income for the full 2004 year.            While there can be no assurances in this regard, we expect that internally-generated cash together with our borrowing ability will be sufficient to support our working capital needs and other obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.    Commitments and Contingencies             We have completed our initial implementation of a PeopleSoft enterprise wide information technology system. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we incurred approximately $6,003,000 in capital expenditures related to this project. There were no costs incurred for this project prior to 2002. We expect to incur an additional $4,000,000 to $4,500,000 in capital expenditures over the next 12 months related to our PeopleSoft enterprise wide information technology system, leasehold improvements and various equipment purchases.            As discussed in "Business" contained in this report, we lease space for our corporate and branch offices. During 2002, we entered into an amendment to our original lease with respect to our corporate offices located in Calabasas, California. This agreement calls for a seven-year extension of the existing lease term from March 2004 to March 2011. We have committed to base rental payments totaling $6,119,000 over the term of the agreement with the last monthly payment due on March 1, 2011. Rent    32          expense for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002, and 2003 was $3,895,000, $4,784,000, and $4,641,000, respectively.            The following table sets forth, on an aggregate basis, at December 31, 2003, the amounts of specified contractual cash obligations required to be paid in the periods shown (in thousands), net of sublease income:       Contractual Obligations       2004     2005     2006     2007     2008     Thereafter     Total    Operating lease obligations     $  3,737     $  2,887     $  1,899     $  1,148     $  893     $  1,378     $  11,942       For additional information about these contractual cash obligations, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report.            We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. However, based on the facts currently available, we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material adverse effect on our financial position.            We are partially self-insured for workers' compensation expense. In connection with this program, we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported. We account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on actuarial reports prepared by an independent third party who reviews historical experience and current trends of industry data. Changes in estimates and differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made. The net self-insurance claim liability amounted to approximately $2,960,000 and $3,612,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (revised in December 2003) ("FIN 46-R"). This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities ("VIEs") that either: (i) do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (ii) are owned by equity investors who lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. Generally, application of FIN 46-R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures commonly referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003, and, for other types of VIEs, for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We have reviewed this pronouncement and determined it is not applicable since we do not own or have an investment in any VIEs.    Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk             We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business, principally risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our held to maturity investments. The interest rate risk is immaterial due to the short maturity of the majority of these investments. We are exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Based on the relative size and nature of our foreign operations, we do not believe that a ten percent change in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would have a material impact on our financial statements.            We do not participate in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments for which the fair value disclosure would be required under SFAS No. 107,    Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments , or derivative commodity instruments. All of our investments are in short-term, investment-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and U.S. Government and agency securities that are carried at fair value on our books. Accordingly, we have no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments.    33       NAME="page_dm1147_1_34">         NAME="dm1147_item_8._financial_statements_and_supplementary_data">      Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data         NAME="dm1147_report_of_independent_auditors">      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS         To the Board of Directors of  On Assignment, Inc.  Calabasas, California            We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of On Assignment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.            We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.            In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of On Assignment, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.            As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" effective January 1, 2002.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   Years Ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003         1.     Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.             On Assignment, Inc. (the "Company"), has two operating segments: Lab Support and Healthcare Staffing. The Lab Support segment provides temporary and temporary-to-permanent placement of scientific personnel with laboratories and other institutions. The Healthcare Staffing segment provides temporary and temporary-to-permanent placement of medical billing and collection professionals, laboratory and medical professionals and traveling nurses, radiology and respiratory personnel to the healthcare industry. Significant accounting policies are as follows:            Principles of Consolidation.     The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.            Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities.     The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less on the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments having a maturity of more than three months and less than twelve months on the date of purchase are classified under current assets as marketable securities. Investments having a maturity of more than twelve months on the date of purchase are classified under non-current assets as marketable securities.            Marketable securities consist principally of Tax Exempt Municipal Bonds and Debt Securities issued by U.S. Government Agencies with maturity dates greater than three months when purchased. All marketable securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are recorded at amortized cost, which approximated market at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003, the Company had no marketable securities.             The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 31, 2002 are as follows (the Company does not have any marketable securities as of December 31, 2003):             Amortized Cost     Gross  Unrealized  Gains     Gross  Unrealized  Losses     Estimated  Fair  Value    2002:                                        Current marketable securities     $  2,000,000     $  5,000     $       $  2,005,000    Non-current marketable securities                                                            Total     $  2,000,000     $  5,000     $       $  2,005,000                                    Accounts Receivable.     Accounts receivable are stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $2,491,000 and $3,458,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Allowance for doubtful accounts is established and maintained based on estimates made by management through its review of specific accounts and historical collection activity. The Company recorded bad debt expense of approximately $293,000, $1,045,000, and $971,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.            Property and Equipment.     Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the related asset or the life of the lease.    40                 Goodwill and Identifiable Intangibles.     Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002, the Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill. Through 2001, the Company amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over 15 years. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if the Company believes events have occurred that would warrant an impairment analysis. Any related impairment losses are recognized when identified. See Note 3 for the effect of adopting FAS No. 142 and impairment testing. Purchased intangible assets, with finite lives, are amortized over their respective lives (up to 7 years).            Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.     The Company evaluates long-lived assets, other than goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, in which case a write-down is recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value.            In August 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." FAS No. 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting issues for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes FAS No. 121 but retains the fundamental provisions for (a) recognition/measurement of impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used; and (b) measurement of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sales. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application encouraged. The Company adopted FAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002. Results of our testing at June 30, 2003 indicated that the carrying value of the identifiable intangible assets and long-lived assets were recoverable, and, therefore, there was no impairment. We will continue to evaluate the carrying amount of the identifiable intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment as required under FAS No. 144.            Income Taxes.     Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent future tax consequences of these differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.            Stockholders Equity.     On August 24, 2000, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Restated Certificate of Incorporation (The "Certificate of Amendment") with the Secretary of the State of Delaware. The Certificate of Amendment increased the authorized number of shares of common stock from 25,000,000 to 75,000,000 and increased the combined authorized number of shares of preferred and common stock from 26,000,000 to 76,000,000. The Certificate of Amendment was approved by the Company's stockholders on June 13, 2000.            On June 15, 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 10 percent of its outstanding shares of common stock in addition to 660,000 shares previously repurchased for a total of 2,941,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, the Company had repurchased 1,524,000 shares and 2,662,500 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $18,418,000 and $22,970,000, respectively. At December 31, 2003, the Company has remaining authorization to repurchase 278,500 shares.            On June 4, 2003 the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholders Rights Plan. In connection with the adoption of the rights plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock, payable to stockholders of record on June 16, 2003. Each right, when exercisable, entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $40.00, subject to adjustment. Initially, the rights will be attached to all certificates representing shares of the Company's outstanding    41          common stock. The rights will separate from the common stock and a distribution of rights certificates will occur upon the earlier to occur of: (i) 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, or (ii) 10 business days following the commencement of, or the first public announcement of the intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in beneficial ownership by a person of 15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The rights will expire on June 4, 2013, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company pursuant to the terms of the rights plan. The rights have certain anti-takeover effects and will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company in a manner or on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.            On June 17, 2003 the Company's stockholders approved an Amendment and Restatement of the On Assignment, Inc. Restated 1987 Stock Option Plan. The total shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Restated 1987 Stock Option Plan was increased from 10,000,000 shares to 11,000,000 shares.             Revenue Recognition.     Revenue from temporary assignments, net of sales adjustments and discounts, is recognized when earned, based on hours worked by the Company's temporary professionals on a weekly basis. Permanent placement fees are recognized when earned, upon conversion of a temporary professional to a client's regular employee. Reimbursements, including those related to travel and out-of-pocket expenses, are included in revenues and equivalent amounts of reimbursable expenses are included in cost of services.            Cost of Services.     Cost of services consist of compensation for temporary professionals and the related payroll taxes and benefits incurred with respect to such compensation. Cost of services are recognized when incurred based on hours worked by the Company's temporary professionals.            Foreign Currency Translation.     Assets and liabilities of foreign operations, where the functional currency is the local currency, are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. The related translation adjustments are recorded as cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, which are not material, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).            Earnings per Share.     Basic earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common share equivalents (consisting of incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options) outstanding during the periods using the treasury stock method. Following is a reconciliation of the shares used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share:             Years Ended December 31,          2001     2002     2003    Weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute basic earnings per share     22,645,000     25,413,000     25,422,000    Dilutive effect of stock options     392,000     129,000                          Number of shares used to compute diluted earnings per share     23,037,000     25,542,000     25,422,000                       42         Anti-dilutive options excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share totaled 600,794 shares, 1,751,373 shares, and 3,007,302 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.            Stock-Based Compensation.     In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FAS No. 123." FAS No. 148 amends FAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, FAS No. 148 amends the disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the methods used on reported results. The disclosure requirements apply to all companies for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002.            The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans, as more fully described in Note 7. The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of FAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and, therefore, no stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income. The following table illustrates the effect on the net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No. 123 to stock based employee compensation.             Years Ended December 31,             2001     2002     2003       Net income (loss)as reported     $  17,040,000     $  12,248,000     $  (81,800,000  )    Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects        3,819,000     $  4,028,000     $  3,016,000                            Net income (loss)pro forma     $   13,221,000     $   8,220,000     $   (84,816,000  )                        Earnings (loss) per share:                                     Basicas reported     $  0.75     $  0.48     $  (3.22  )       Basicpro forma     $  0.58     $  0.32     $  (3.34  )        Dilutedas reported     $   0.74     $   0.48     $   (3.22  )       Dilutedpro forma     $  0.57     $  0.32     $  (3.34  )               Use of Estimates.     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.            Concentration of Credit Risk.     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risks consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade receivables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities with quality credit institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited because of the large number of geographically dispersed customers, thus spreading the trade credit risk. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations to identify risks and maintains an allowance to address these risks.            Fair Value of Financial Instruments.     The recorded values of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value    43          based on their short-term nature. The fair values of marketable securities were estimated using quoted market prices.            Exit or Disposal Activities.     FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. FAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3 "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Costs to Exit and Disposal Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)". FAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurements of the liability.            The Company expensed $1,687,000 of costs during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 in connection with the reduction of personnel and office closures, which are allocated $1,062,000, $566,000 and $59,000 to the Healthcare Staffing segment, Lab Support segment and corporate office, respectively. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, as shown on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. The costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 consist of $478,000 in severance costs and $1,209,000 in office closure costs. Payments of $769,000 have been made as of December 31, 2003. The remaining liability of $918,000 is included in other accrued expenses on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003.            Capitalization of Software Development Costs.     Under the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," the Company capitalizes costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application stage and meet recoverability tests. Such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with the applications. In addition, the Company capitalizes costs incurred for enhancements or modifications to the software that result in additional functionality to the software's performance.            Reclassifications.     Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year consolidated financial statements to conform with the current year consolidated financial statement presentation.            Recent Accounting Pronouncements.     In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (revised in December 2003) ("FIN 46-R"). This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities ("VIEs") that either: (i) do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (ii) are owned by equity investors who lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. Generally, application of FIN 46-R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures commonly referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003, and, for other types of VIEs, for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We have reviewed this pronouncement and determined it is not applicable since we do not own or have an investment in any VIEs.    44          2.     Property and Equipment.             Property and equipment at December 31, 2002 and 2003, consisted of the following:             2002     2003       Furniture and fixtures     $  1,802,000     $  1,432,000       Computers and related equipment        2,183,000        2,334,000       Computer Software        2,236,000        9,159,000       Machinery and equipment        1,128,000        1,035,000       Leasehold improvements        1,520,000        1,558,000       Construction in progress        3,403,000        461,000                                12,272,000        15,979,000        Less accumulated depreciation and amortization         (4,895,000  )     (6,804,000  )                    Total     $  7,377,000     $  9,175,000                          Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 was $1,384,000, $1,916,000 and $2,942,000, respectively.            The Company implemented PeopleSoft, an enterprise wide information technology system, at the beginning of 2003 and is continuing to add significant enhancements to the software applications. The Company has capitalized approximately $6,003,000, through December 31, 2003, related to external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for internal employees who are directly associated with the applications.    3.     Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets.              Goodwill of $123,835,000 and $43,538,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively, represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired (see Note 10). The goodwill balance of $43,538,000 at December 31, 2003 is allocated $42,341,000 and $1,197,000 to the Healthcare Staffing and Lab Support segments, respectively. Amortization expense was $151,000, $0, and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003.            FAS No. 142 includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company adopted FAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2002. The Company completed the transitional test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the second quarter of 2002 and subsequently tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2002. Based on the results of these tests, the Company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002 and subsequently on December 31, 2002.            The Company's management concluded at June 30, 2003, however, that significant events had occurred for purposes of its goodwill impairment analysis, requiring management to perform an analysis prior to the next regularly scheduled impairment testing date to determine whether the recorded goodwill balance was impaired. Lower demand for the Company's temporary professionals due to a slow down in research and development spending, general economic conditions and increased competition for its services were primary factors resulting in: (1) the Company's lower market capitalization at June 30, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002; (2) the Company's implementation of personnel reductions and office closures at the end of the first and second quarters of 2003; and (3) reduction of the Company's current and projected operating results.            As part of this analysis, FAS No. 142 required the Company's management to estimate the fair value of its reporting units as compared with their estimated carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the estimated carrying value, then an impairment is deemed to have    45          occurred. In estimating the fair value of its reporting units, the Company used the income approach, which utilizes forecasted discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value. The Company also considered total market capitalization as of June 30, 2003 and the average market capitalization for a period one month prior to and subsequent to that date in order to assess the volatility of the market capitalization.            Based on its impairment analysis, the Company concluded that goodwill, related to one of its reporting units in the Healthcare Staffing segment, was impaired. As required by FAS No. 142, in measuring the amount of goodwill impairment, the Company made a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the tangible and intangible assets (other than goodwill) of the reporting unit. Based on this allocation, the Company concluded that $79,897,000 of recorded goodwill was impaired. The goodwill impairment was expensed as a non-cash charge to continuing operations during the second quarter of 2003. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis at December 31, 2003 and concluded that there was no further impairment to goodwill.            The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 are as follows:       Balance as of December 31, 2001     $  1,542,000       Goodwill acquired        122,293,000                   Balance as of December 31, 2002     $  123,835,000       Goodwill impairment        (79,897,000  )    Purchase adjustment        (400,000  )                Balance as of December 31, 2003     $  43,538,000                              As of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, the Company had the following acquired intangible assets:             December 31, 2002     December 31, 2003          Gross  Carrying  Amount     Accumulated  Amortization     Net  Carrying  Amount     Estimated  Useful  Life     Gross  Carrying  Amount     Accumulated  Amortization     Goodwill/  Impairment     Purchase  Adjustment     Net  Carrying  Amount     Estimated  Useful  Life    Intangible assets subject to amortization:                                                                                        Customer relations     $  11,100,000     $  1,943,000     $  9,157,000     7 years     $  11,100,000     $  4,440,000     $       $       $  6,660,000     7 years    Contractor  relations        3,900,000        546,000        3,354,000     5 years        3,900,000        1,326,000                        2,574,000     5 years    Covenants not to compete        737,000        280,000        457,000     2 years        737,000        701,000                        36,000     2 years    Employment agreements        600,000        210,000        390,000     2 years        600,000        600,000                             2 years    Backlog        400,000        280,000        120,000     1 year        400,000        400,000                             1 year                                                     Subtotal     $  16,737,000     $  3,259,000     $  13,478,000           $  16,737,000     $  7,467,000     $       $       $  9,270,000                                                           Intangible assets not subject to amortization:                                                                                        Goodwill     $  124,472,000     $  637,000     $  123,835,000           $  124,472,000     $  637,000     $  79,897,000     $  400,000     $  43,538,000                                                           Total     $  141,209,000     $  3,896,000     $  137,313,000           $  141,209,000     $  8,104,000     $  79,897,000     $  400,000     $  52,808,000                                                                      Amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization was $3,000, $3,227,000 and $4,208,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Estimated annual amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2004 through December 31, 2009 is $2.9 million, $2.5 million, $2.1 million, $1.2 million, $.5 million, and $.1 million, respectively.    46                  A reconciliation of reported net income (loss) to net income (loss) adjusted to reflect the adoption of FAS No.142 is as follows:             Year Ended December 31,             2001     2002     2003       Reported net income (loss)     $  17,040,000     $  12,248,000     $  (81,800,000  )    Add back: goodwill amortization        151,000                                           Adjusted net income (loss)     $  17,191,000     $  12,248,000     $  (81,800,000  )                        Reported basic earnings (loss) per share     $  0.75     $  0.48     $  (3.22  )                        Adjusted basic earnings (loss) per share     $  0.76     $  0.48     $  (3.22  )                        Reported diluted earnings (loss) per share     $  0.74     $  0.48     $  (3.22  )                        Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share     $  0.75     $  0.48     $  (3.22  )                           4.     401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, Deferred Compensation Plan and Change in Control Severance Plan.             Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted the On Assignment, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of the Company's acquisition of HPO in April 2002, the Company assumed the HPO 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan established on September 1, 1997. Eligible employees may elect to have a portion of their salary deferred and contributed to the plans. The amount of salary deferred is not subject to Federal and State income tax at the time of deferral. The plans cover all eligible employees and provide for matching or discretionary contributions at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company made matching or discretionary contributions to the plans of $0, $189,000, and $276,000 during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively.            Effective January 1, 1998, the Company implemented the On Assignment, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan. The plan permits a select group of management or highly compensated employees or directors to annually elect to defer up to 100 percent of their base salary, annual bonus, stock option gain or fees on a pre-tax basis and earn tax-deferred interest on these amounts. Distributions from the plan are made at retirement, death or termination of employment, in a lump sum, or over five, ten or fifteen years. At December 31, 2002 and 2003, the liability under the plan was approximately $1,351,000 and $1,107,000, respectively. A life insurance policy is maintained on the participants relating to the plan, whereby the Company is the sole owner and beneficiary of such insurance. The cash surrender value of this life insurance policy, which is reflected in other assets, was approximately $1,319,000 and $1,637,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively.            During 1999, a participant in the Deferred Compensation Plan performed a stock-for-stock exercise resulting in a gain to the participant of approximately $294,000. A stock certificate for 19,764 shares was issued into a rabbi trust in the Company's name. The employer stock held by the rabbi trust has been classified in equity in the same manner as treasury stock, with a reduction in shares outstanding and a corresponding reduction to Paid-in Capital. The corresponding deferred compensation liability is also shown as a separate component in equity. There is no effect on the Consolidated Statements of Income as a result of this transaction.            During 2002, and 2003, the participant received a disbursement of 1,976 shares based on a 10 year distribution schedule. In addition, during 2003, the participant received an additional disbursement of 14,230 shares resulting from the participant's request for an early distribution. The participant was subject to a 10 percent (1,582 shares) penalty. The distribution resulted in an increase in shares outstanding and a corresponding increase to paid in capital. The corresponding deferred compensation    47          liability, shown as a component in equity, was reduced by $29,000 in 2002 and $265,000 in 2003. In addition, the Company recorded a gain in the amount of $24,000 resulting from the 10 percent early distribution penalty charged to the participant.            On February 12, 1998, the Company adopted the On Assignment, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan ("the Plan") to provide severance benefits for officers and other eligible employees who are terminated following an acquisition of the Company. Under the Plan, if an eligible employee is involuntarily terminated within 18 months of a change in control, as defined in the Plan, then the employee will be entitled to salary plus target bonus payable in a lump sum. The amounts payable would range from one month to 18 months of salary and target bonus, depending on the employee's length of service and position with the Company.     5.     Commitments and Contingencies.             The Company leases its facilities and certain office equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2011. Certain leases contain rent escalations and/or renewal options. The Company also subleases 1,450 square feet of office space through 2005. At December 31, 2002 and 2003, the balance of deferred rent liability was $153,000 and $375,000, respectively.            The following is a summary of future minimum lease payments, net of sublease income, by year:             Operating  Leases    2004     $  3,737,000    2005        2,887,000    2006        1,899,000    2007        1,148,000    2008        893,000    Thereafter        1,378,000             Total Minimum Lease Payments     $  11,942,000                        Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002, and 2003 was $3,895,000, $4,784,000, and $4,641,000, respectively.            The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. However, based on the facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Company.            The Company is partially self-insured for workers' compensation expense. In connection with this program, the Company pays a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and is insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported. The Company accounts for claims incurred but not yet reported based on actuarial reports prepared by an independent third party who reviews historical experience and current trends of industry data. Changes in estimates and differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made. The net self-insurance claim liability amounted to approximately $2,960,000 and $3,612,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively.    48          6.     Income Taxes.             Income (loss) before provision for income taxes consists of the following:             Years Ended December 31,             2001     2002     2003       United States     25,699,000     18,093,000     (84,076,000  )    Foreign     1,387,000     1,725,000     1,309,000                                 27,086,000     19,818,000     (82,767,000  )                                   The provision for income taxes consists of the following:             Years Ended December 31,             2001     2002     2003       Current:                                     Federal     $  8,726,000     $  3,375,000     $  633,000          State        1,160,000        896,000        (5,000  )       Foreign        575,000        346,000        392,000                                    10,461,000        4,617,000        1,020,000                           Deferred:                                     Federal        (337,000  )     2,425,000        (1,868,000  )       State        (32,000  )     242,000        (289,000  )       Foreign        (46,000  )     286,000        170,000                                    (415,000  )     2,953,000        (1,987,000  )                        Total     $  10,046,000     $  7,570,000     $  (967,000  )                                   At December 31, 2003, the Company has accumulated net foreign earnings of $2,221,000. The Company does not plan to repatriate these earnings, therefore, no U.S. income tax has been provided on the foreign earnings. If such earnings were distributed, U.S. income taxes would be partially reduced for taxes paid to the jurisdictions in which the income was earned. Additionally, the Company has not tax effected the cumulative translation adjustment as there is no intention of repatriating foreign earnings.            Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of certain assets and liabilities for tax purposes in periods different from those in which they are recognized in the financial statements. These differences relate primarily to purchased intangibles, workers' compensation, deferred compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses, reserve for bad debt, and state taxes.            Deferred assets and liabilities are classified as current and non-current according to the nature of the assets or liabilities from which they arose.    49                  The components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:             December 31, 2002     December 31, 2003             Federal     State     Federal     State       Deferred tax assets:                                              Current:                                                 Allowance for doubtful accounts     $  606,000     $  85,000     $  784,000     $  124,000             Employee related accruals        572,000        60,000        540,000        60,000             State taxes        354,000                109,000        12,000             Reserve for Branch office closures                        247,000        27,000             Workers' compensation loss reserve        956,000        99,000        1,239,000        137,000             Other                        24,000        3,000                               Total current deferred tax assets        2,488,000        244,000        2,943,000        363,000                               Deferred tax liabilities:                                              Non-current:                                                 Purchased intangibles, net        (2,856,000  )     (339,000  )     (1,639,000  )     (181,000   )          Depreciation and amortization expense        229,000        24,000        382,000        42,000             Other        341,000        29,000        214,000        23,000                               Total non-current deferred tax liabilities        (2,286,000  )     (286,000  )     (1,043,000  )     (116,000   )                            Total deferred tax assets (liabilities)     $  202,000     $  (42,000  )  $  1,900,000     $  247,000                                          The Company had gross deferred tax assets of $3,355,000 and $3,967,000 and gross deferred tax liabilities of $3,195,000 and $1,820,000 at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, respectively. Foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities were not material as of December 31, 2002 and 2003 and are included in the Federal balances in the table above.             The reconciliation between the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent in 2001 and 2002 and 34 percent in 2003 to income before income taxes and the actual income taxes is as follows:             Years Ended December 31,             2001     2002     2003       Income tax expenses at the statutory rate     $  9,480,000     $  6,936,000     $  (28,141,000  )    State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit        1,235,000        684,000        (179,000  )    Non-deductible Goodwill Impairment                        27,165,000       Tax-free interest and other        (669,000  )     (50,000  )     188,000                           Total     $  10,046,000     $  7,570,000     $  (967,000  )                                   The Company receives a tax deduction as the result of disqualifying dispositions made by directors, officers and employees. A disqualifying disposition occurs when stock acquired through the exercise of incentive stock options or the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is disposed of prior to the required holding period or upon exercise of a non-qualified stock option. At December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, net income taxes payable and additional paid-in capital include tax benefits amounting to $2,572,000, $713,000, and $19,000, respectively, resulting from disqualifying dispositions by directors, officers and employees.     7.     Stock Option Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan.             Under its Stock Option Plan, the Company may grant employees, contractors, and non-employee members of the Board of Directors incentive or non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of its    50          common stock. On June 13, 2000, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Stock Option Plan that increased the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Stock Option Plan from 8,000,000 shares to 10,000,000 shares. On June 18, 2002, the Board of Directors extended the term of the Stock Option Plan, which would have ended on June 21, 2002. The termination date of the Stock Option Plan is now June 17, 2012. Optionees, option prices, option amounts, grant dates and vesting are established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The option prices may not be less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is granted. The Company generally issues stock options at the fair market value. Stock options granted to date generally become exercisable over a period of four years and have a maximum term of ten years measured from the grant date.             On June 17, 2003 the Company's stockholders approved an Amendment and Restatement of the On Assignment, Inc. Restated 1987 Stock Option Plan. The total shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Restated 1987 Stock Option Plan was increased from 10,000,000 shares to 11,000,000 shares.            The following summarizes stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003:             Incentive  Stock  Options     Non-Qualified  Stock Options     Weighted  Average  Exercise Price  Per Share    Outstanding at January 1, 2001     1,382,654     987,439     $  16.19       Granted     623,783     404,467     $  19.21       Exercised     (343,977  )  (292,374  )  $  11.23       Canceled     (510,970  )  (175,588  )  $  20.20                     Outstanding at December 31, 2001     1,151,490     923,944     $  18.07       Granted     303,234     1,116,066     $  16.50       Exercised     (97,065  )  (228,689  )  $  14.75       Canceled     (443,568  )  (323,999  )  $  20.38                     Outstanding at December 31, 2002     914,091     1,487,322     $  16.93       Granted     750,398     797,052     $  5.20       Exercised     (520  )  (2,208  )  $  3.65       Canceled     (392,813  )  (546,020  )  $  13.95                     Outstanding at December 31, 2003     1,271,156     1,736,146     $  11.83                       51       NAME="page_fo1147_1_52">               The following summarizes pricing and term information for options outstanding as of December 31, 2003:                         Options Outstanding     Options Exercisable    Range of  Exercise Prices      Number  Outstanding at  December 31,  2003     Weighted  Average  Remaining  Contractual  Life     Weighted  Average  Exercise Price     Exercisable at  December 31,  2003     Weighted  Average  Exercise Price    $  3.36     to     $  5.22     416,082     9.7 years     $  4.87     55,821     $  4.37       5.23     to        5.25     797,932     9.6 years        5.25     80,114        5.25       5.28     to        15.6875     602,552     7.0 years        9.96     377,681        11.61       15.80     to        18.75     605,134     7.5 years        17.59     359,772        17.48       18.92     to        33.00     585,602     7.8 years        21.73     367,155        22.25                                      $  3.36     to     $  33.00     3,007,302     8.3 years     $  11.83     1,240,543     $  15.73                                                 The Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase common stock of the Company, through payroll deductions, at 85 percent of the lower of the market price on the first day or the last day of the semi-annual purchase period. Eligible employees may contribute intervals of 1 percent of their base earnings toward the purchase of the stock (subject to certain IRS limitations). During 2001, 2002 and 2003 shares issued under the plan were 13,297, 19,487, and 80,694, respectively. On June 18, 2002, the Board of Directors extended the term of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which would have ended on August 31, 2002, until August 31, 2022.             The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its Stock Option Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan and accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock option and purchase plans. The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of FAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The estimated fair value of options granted during 2001, 2002 and 2003 pursuant to FAS No. 123 was approximately $10,019,000, $11,916,000, and $4,082,000, respectively, and the estimated fair value of stock purchased under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan was approximately $112,000, $86,000, and $104,000, respectively. Pro forma compensation cost of shares purchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is measured based on the discount from market value.            The fair value of each option included is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:             Years Ended December 31,          2001     2002     2003    Dividend yield                   Risk-free interest rate     4.5%     3.8%     3.1%    Expected volatility     55%     58%     59%    Expected lives     5 years     5 years     5 years       8.     Business Segments.             Indicated below is the information required to comply with FAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."            The Company has two reportable operating segments: Lab Support and Healthcare Staffing. The Lab Support segment provides temporary and permanent placement services of laboratory and scientific professionals to the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, chemical industries. The Healthcare Staffing segment includes the combined results of Healthcare Financial Staffing, Clinical Lab Staff, Diagnostic Imaging Staff, Respiratory Therapists, Nurse Travel and Allied Travel. The Healthcare Staffing segment provides temporary and permanent placement services of medical billing    52          and collection professionals, laboratory and medical professionals and traveling nurses, laboratory, radiology, and respiratory personnel to the healthcare industry.            The Company's management evaluates performance of each segment primarily based on revenues, gross profit and operating income (before interest and income taxes). The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 1). The information in the following table is derived directly from the segments' internal financial reporting used for corporate management purposes.

This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of HPO in April 2002. Domestic Long-Lived Assets decreased $82,391,000 from $146,061,000 at December 31, 2002 to $63,670,000 at December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a non-cash charge related to impairment of goodwill.    9.     Unaudited Quarterly Results.             The following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003.

The Company's primary reason for making this acquisition was to enter the travel nurse and allied healthcare industries, supplement its locally-based allied temporary professionals and become a more comprehensive staffing partner.            The total purchase price, not including a $5,000,000 earn-out provision, was $143,196,000, consisting of the sum of $64,043,000 in cash paid to the shareholders, debt assumed of $5,729,000, the issuance of 3,768,978 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $70,834,000 and $2,590,000 of transaction-related costs. The terms of the acquisition included an earn-out provision that provided for the return of up to $5,000,000 in merger consideration if certain operations conducted by HPO met or exceeded targeted amounts. These targeted amounts were not met at December 31, 2002, the determination date. As a result, in March 2003, $2,500,000 of cash and $2,500,000 in shares of On Assignment's common stock, (equivalent to 281,057 shares of our common stock based on an average price determined during the last 10 days of 2002 under the terms of the merger agreement) were returned to the Company. The 281,057 shares consisted of 133,022 shares held in escrow, equal to $2,500,000 at the time of the HPO acquisition in April 2002, and an additional 148,035 shares required to yield a valuation of $2,500,000 at December 31, 2002.            The transaction has been accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 141 and, accordingly, the results of operations of HPO have been included with those of the Company since the date of acquisition. The operations of HPO are reported in the Company's Healthcare Staffing segment. The purchase price of $143,196,000 has been allocated as follows:       Current assets     $  16,138,000    Fixed assets        1,819,000    Identifiable intangible assets        16,700,000    Goodwill        121,893,000                Total assets     $  156,550,000             Current liabilities     $  7,008,000    Deferred income taxes related to identifiable intangible assets        6,346,000                Total liabilities     $  13,354,000             Net purchase price     $  143,196,000                        This purchase price allocated to goodwill is not tax deductible. Subsequent to the initial purchase price allocation, significant adjustments were made in 2002 to reduce the identifiable intangible assets by $7,800,000, increase income tax receivable by $2,800,000, reduce the deferred income taxes related to identifiable intangible assets by $2,964,000 and increase goodwill by $1,575,000. An adjustment was also made in 2003 to reduce goodwill for $400,000 as a result of an adjustment to the income taxes receivable related to the period prior to the acquisition. These adjustments have been included in the allocated balances listed above.    55        NAME="page_fq1147_1_56">        NAME="fq1147_item_9._changes_in_and_disagre__ite03576">      Item 9.
