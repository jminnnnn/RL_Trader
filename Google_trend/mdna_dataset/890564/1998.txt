ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           The discussion in this Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the integration of acquired operations, management of growth and other risks discussed in "Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results" in Item 1 of this Annual Report, beginning on page 4, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Report and from time to time in the Company's other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the risks discussed in the "Risk Factors" section included in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1 as declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 21, 1992 (Reg. No. 33-50646).  SEASONALITY           The Company's results have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations. Demand for the Company's temporary employees typically declines from the year-end holiday season through February, resulting in a corresponding decrease in revenues, operating income and net income. Demand for the Company's temporary employees also often declines in June, July and August due to decreases in clients' activity during vacation periods and the availability of students to perform temporary work. As a result, the Company has experienced slower growth or declines in revenues, operating income and net income during the first quarter and from the second quarter to third quarter of prior years.  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 AND 1997           REVENUES. Revenues increased by 22.3% from $88,188,000 in the year ended December 31, 1996, to $107,849,000 in the year ended December 31, 1997, as a result of the increased revenues of the Lab Support and the Healthcare Financial Staffing divisions, partially offset by a decrease in the revenues of the EnviroStaff division.           The growth of the Lab Support division's revenues were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment and to a lesser extent to an increase in average hourly billing rates during 1997. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment in the Lab Support division was primarily attributable to the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Lab Support division has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new offices opened in the past year. Lab Support's revenue growth was tempered by an unusually high number of conversions of temporary employees to permanent status in the fourth quarter of 1997, primarily as a result of the tight domestic labor market.           The growth of the Healthcare Financial Staffing division's revenues were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment and to a lesser extent to an increase in average hourly billing rates during 1997, which were principally attributable to a concentration on new business with a higher price structure. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment in the Healthcare Financial Staffing division was primarily attributable to the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Healthcare Financial Staffing division has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new offices opened in the past year. Healthcare Financial Staffing's revenue growth was tempered by an unusually high number of conversions of temporary employees to permanent status in the fourth quarter of 1997, primarily as a result of the tight domestic labor market.           The decrease in the EnviroStaff division's revenues were primarily attributable to the continuing transition of the division's business away from remediation and the resulting planned decline in remediation assignments, partially offset by increases in revenue from the division's higher margin core business and an increase in average hourly billing rates. In addition, severe winter weather in several key markets contributed to the decrease in revenues in 1997.           COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services consists solely of compensation for temporary employees and payroll taxes and benefits paid by the Company in connection with such compensation. Cost of services increased 22.1% from $61,231,000 in 1996 to $74,748,000 in 1997. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased from 69.4% in 1996 to 69.3% in 1997. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in conversion fee revenue of the Lab Support and Healthcare Financial Staffing divisions in 1997. In addition, an increase in average gross margins of the EnviroStaff division was offset by an increase in employer paid benefits and workers' compensation expense reserves.                                          10    11          OPERATING EXPENSES. Operating expenses include the costs associated with the Company's network of Account Managers and branch offices, including Account Manager compensation, rent, other office expenses and advertising for temporary employees, and corporate office expenses such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, management compensation, Account Manager recruiting and training expenses, corporate advertising and promotion, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses increased 17.0% from $17,699,000 in 1996 to $20,714,000 in 1997. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 20.1% in 1996 to 19.2% in 1997. This result was primarily attributable to the increased productivity of the Account Managers.           ACQUISITION COSTS. Acquisition costs consisted principally of legal, accounting, financial advisory services and other expenses related to the initial combination of EnviroStaff, Inc. and the Company in 1996. The combined companies incurred approximately $401,000 in acquisition costs during the first quarter of 1996.           INTEREST INCOME, NET. Interest income, net increased 51.7% from $549,000 in 1996 to $833,000 in 1997, primarily as a result of interest earned on higher interest-bearing cash, cash equivalent and marketable security account balances in 1997, and the effect of interest expense charged on EnviroStaff, Inc.'s line of credit borrowings in 1996.           PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Provision for income taxes increased 30.4% from $3,800,000 in 1996 to $4,954,000 in 1997. The Company's effective tax rate decreased from 40.4% in 1996 to 37.5% in 1997. This decrease was primarily attributable to the consolidation of divisional field operations into Assignment Ready, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which resulted in a lower overall effective state tax rate.                                          11    12 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1996           REVENUES. Revenues increased by 21.4% from $72,617,000 in the year ended December 31, 1995, to $88,188,000 in the year ended December 31, 1996, primarily as a result of the increase in the revenues of the Lab Support division and to a lesser extent from the increase in revenues generated by EnviroStaff and the Healthcare Financial Staffing division.           The growth of the Lab Support division's revenues were primarily attributable to the number of temporary employees on assignment. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment in the Lab Support division was primarily the result of the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Lab Support division has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new Lab Support offices opened in the past year. However, Lab Support's revenue growth was tempered by a higher number of conversions of temporary employees to permanent status in 1996 as compared to 1995, and the impact of severe winter weather in several key markets during the first quarter of 1996. Average hourly billing rates of the Lab Support division did not vary significantly between the two periods.           The growth of the Healthcare Financial Staffing division's revenues were primarily attributable to higher average hourly billing rates, which were principally attributable to a concentration on new business with a higher price structure, and to a lesser extent from the contribution of new offices opened in 1996.           The growth of EnviroStaff's revenues were primarily attributable to the contribution of new EnviroStaff offices opened in 1996, as well as the growth of most existing offices. Average hourly billing rates of EnviroStaff did not vary significantly between the two periods.           COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services increased 20.5% from $50,812,000 in 1995 to $61,231,000 in 1996. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased from 70.0% in 1995 to 69.4% in 1996. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in conversion fee revenue of the Lab Support division in the 1996 period. In addition, an increase in average gross margins of the Healthcare Financial Staffing division in the 1996 period and an increase in average gross margins of EnviroStaff as a result of a decrease in average pay rates in the 1996 period, was partially offset by an increase in employer payroll taxes and employer paid benefits.           OPERATING EXPENSES. Operating expenses increased 18.4% from $14,950,000 in 1995 to $17,699,000 in 1996. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 20.6% in 1995 to 20.1% in 1996. This result was primarily attributable to the increased productivity of the Account Managers.           ACQUISITION COSTS. The Company incurred approximately $401,000 in acquisition costs during the first quarter of 1996, related to the initial combination of EnviroStaff, Inc. and the Company.           INTEREST INCOME, NET. Interest income, net increased 33.9% from $410,000 in 1995 to $549,000 in 1996, primarily as a result of interest earned on higher interest-bearing cash, cash equivalent and marketable security account balances in 1996, partially offset by interest expense charged on EnviroStaff's line of credit borrowings in 1996.           PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Provision for income taxes increased 30.0% from $2,924,000 in 1995 to $3,800,000 in 1996. The Company's effective tax rate remained consistent at approximately 40% in 1995 and 1996.                                          12    13 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           The Company's primary sources of cash in 1996 and 1997 were funds provided by operating activities. In 1996, operating activities provided $5,678,000 of cash compared to $8,281,000 in 1997. This increase was primarily attributable to higher net income and a larger increase in income taxes payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses in 1997 compared to 1996, partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable in 1997 compared to 1996, which was principally due to the increase in revenues.           Cash provided by investing activities totaled $1,404,000 in 1996 compared to cash used for investing activities of $3,537,000 in 1997. This was primarily attributable to cash used to purchase marketable securities exceeding cash proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities in 1997.           Cash provided by financing activities was $693,000 in 1996 compared to $2,497,000 in 1997. The increase was primarily attributable to greater proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the Company's Stock Option Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 1997, and repayments of EnviroStaff's line of credit borrowings exceeding the related borrowings during 1996.           Effective November 25, 1997, the Company renewed its unsecured bank line of credit. The maximum borrowings allowable under this agreement are $7,000,000 and bear interest at the bank's reference rate (8.50% at December 31, 1997). The agreement expires on July 1, 1999. No borrowings were outstanding under this credit line at December 31, 1997.           In addition, the Company's EnviroStaff subsidiary had a $1,000,000 line of credit with a bank at the time of its acquisition by the Company. Borrowings accrued interest at prime plus 1.25%. Advances were secured by all of the assets of EnviroStaff and the agreement included requirements for minimum operating ratios and tangible net worth and restricted the payment of dividends. On April 19, 1996, the Company paid the outstanding balance in full and the line of credit agreement was terminated.           The Company believes that its cash balances, together with the funds from operations and its borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through at least the next twelve months.                                          13    14 ITEM 8.
