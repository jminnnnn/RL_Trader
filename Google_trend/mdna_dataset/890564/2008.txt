Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                 This discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "intends" and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our anticipated financial and operating performance for future periods. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or prove our forward-looking statements, by hindsight, to be overly optimistic or unachievable include, but are not limited to, the following:       actual demand for our services;  our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified staffing consultants;  our ability to remain competitive in obtaining and retaining temporary staffing clients;  the availability of qualified temporary nurses and other qualified contract professionals;  our ability to manage our growth efficiently and effectively; and  continued performance of our information systems.      For a discussion of these and other factors that may impact our realization of our forward-looking statements, see "BusinessRisk Factors" within Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other factors may also contribute to the differences between our forward-looking statements and our actual results. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, our past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date we file this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or the reasons why our actual results may differ.    Overview             In 2007, our strategy was in large part focused on assisting the newly acquired Physician and IT and Engineering segments to continue to perform while integrating with and operating as a part of On Assignment. We also concentrated on diversifying our client mix in the Healthcare segment though the expansion of our client base. We continued to focus on growing revenues, improving gross profit and rationalizing and leveraging our selling, general and administrative expenses, which enabled us to grow our profits in 2007.            We made significant progress in further strengthening the sales force through the hiring of seasoned professionals with staffing industry experience and committing more resources to our newer services lines; local nursing, health information management, clinical research and our two new segments: Physician and IT and Engineering.             Consolidated revenues were up 97.2 percent from $287,566,000 in 2006 to $567,180,000 in 2007. Consolidated gross margin improved 460 basis points from 27.1 percent in 2006 to 31.7 percent in 2007. For the full year, gross profit increased 130.6 percent from $77,841,000 in 2006 to $179,537,000 in 2007.            In 2007, our results of operations were affected significantly by our acquisition of VISTA and Oxford.    29                  On January 3, 2007, we acquired VSS Holding, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which includes VISTA Staffing Solutions, Inc. (VISTA), a privately-owned leading provider of physician staffing, known as locum tenens, and permanent physician search services. VISTA is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah and works with more than 1,000 physicians covering approximately thirty medical specialties. On a daily basis, VISTA has over 200 physicians on assignment. VISTA provides its staffing solutions in all fifty states and international markets for organizations ranging from large urban hospitals to small practice groups in rural areas. VISTA's CEO and management team have remained with us after the acquisition. The primary reasons for the VISTA acquisition were to diversify our existing healthcare offerings, to compliment our existing Nurse Travel business line with cross-selling opportunities and to leverage our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including housing, travel and credentialing costs.            The total purchase price of $44,235,000 consisted of (i) an initial price of $41,141,000, paid in cash, (ii) $889,000 in direct acquisition costs and (iii) $2,205,000 for the estimated payment of the earn-out related to the 2007 operating performance of VISTA. Payment of the earn-out is tentatively scheduled for April 2008, pending the agreement of both parties to all terms and provisions. The estimated earn-out payments have been included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other accrued expenses. There is potential for additional consideration of $5,795,000 that is contingent upon the 2008 financial performance of the physician segment. This earn-out will be recorded as additional purchase price in the future at such time when the targets are met and the consideration is earned.            We recorded the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting, and thus the results of operations from VISTA are included in our consolidated financial statements (Physician segment) from the acquisition date. Pursuant to SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141), the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Adjustments to the purchase price, such as the earn-out for 2008, will be reflected in subsequent periods if and when conditions are met. The purchase price was allocated as follows: $1,751,000 to net tangible assets acquired, $3,140,000 to identified intangible assets with definite lives, $6,500,000 to identified intangible assets with indefinite lives and $32,844,000 to goodwill. The weighted average amortization period for the identifiable intangible assets with definite lives is estimated to be 1.1 years. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.            On January 31, 2007, we acquired Oxford Global Resources, Inc. (Oxford), a leading provider of high-end information technology and engineering staffing services. The primary reasons for the Oxford acquisition were to enter the markets for information technology and engineering staffing services and to leverage our existing SG&A infrastructure.             The total purchase price of $207,723,000 consisted of (i) an initial price of $200,072,000, comprised of $190,072,000 paid in cash and 795,292 shares of our common stock valued at $10,000,000, (ii) $1,331,000 in direct acquisition costs and (iii) $6,320,000 for the estimated payment of the earn-out related to the 2007 operating performance of Oxford. Payment of the earn-out is tentatively scheduled for April 2008, pending the agreement of both parties to all terms and provisions. These costs have been included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other accrued expenses. There is potential for additional consideration of $5,680,000 that is contingent upon the 2008 financial performance of Oxford. This earn-out will be recorded as additional purchase price in the future at such time when the targets are met and the consideration is earned.             We recorded the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting, and thus the results of operations from Oxford are included in our consolidated financial statements (IT and Engineering segment) from the acquisition date. Pursuant to SFAS 141, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition.    30          Adjustments to the purchase price, such as the earn-out for 2008, will be reflected in subsequent periods if and when conditions are met. The purchase price was allocated as follows: $17,089,000 to net tangible assets acquired, $30,300,000 to identified intangible assets with definite lives, $15,700,000 to identified intangible assets with indefinite lives and $144,634,000 to goodwill. The weighted average amortization period for the identifiable intangible assets with definite lives is estimated to be 2.1 years. The Company expects to reduce its federal and state income tax liability by approximately $5,000,000 per year over fifteen years as a result of an election to classify the Oxford acquisition as an asset sale for tax purposes under section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.             We utilized our existing cash and proceeds from a new $165,000,000 senior secured credit facility to finance the acquisitions. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of the credit facility.    Seasonality             Demand for our staffing services historically has been lower during the first and fourth quarters due to fewer business days resulting from client shutdowns and a decline in the number of contract professionals willing to work during the holidays. This may have particular impact in 2008 because of the number of holidays that occur during the normal work week. As is common in the staffing industry, we run special incentive programs to keep our contract professionals, particularly nurses, working through the holidays. Demand for our staffing services usually increases in the second and third quarters of the year. In addition, our cost of services typically increases in the first quarter primarily due to the reset of payroll taxes.    Critical Accounting Policies             Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.            Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Billing Adjustments.     We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts as well as an allowance for billing adjustments related to trade receivables based on our analysis of historical collection and adjustment experience. We apply actual collection and adjustment percentages to the outstanding accounts receivable balances at the end of the period. If we experience a significant change in collections or billing adjustment experience, our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change by a material amount.            Workers' Compensation and Medical Malpractice Loss Reserves.     We are partially self-insured for our workers' compensation liability related to the Life Sciences, Healthcare and IT and Engineering segments as well as our medical malpractice liability in relation to the Physician segment. In connection with these programs, we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred, not to exceed certain stop-loss limits. We are insured for losses above these limits, both per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported. We account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data.    31           Changes in estimates and differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or the payments were made.            In conjunction with the $165,000,000 senior secured credit facility entered into on January 31, 2007, the restricted cash and cash equivalents of $4,678,000 previously collateralized in association with three letters of credit related to our workers' compensation program were released. The net self-insurance claim liability was approximately $3,551,000 and $8,921,000 at December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively.            Contingencies.     We account for contingencies in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." SFAS 5 requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies, such as legal settlements, workers' compensation matters and medical malpractice insurance matters, requires us to use our judgment. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss, results of operations may be over or understated.            Income taxes.     As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse. If necessary, a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred income tax assets in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. The estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate.            During the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004, we established a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. The valuation allowance was calculated pursuant to SFAS 109, which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Such evidence includes a company's past and projected future performance, the market environment in which the company operates, the utilization of past tax credits and the length of carryback and carryforward periods of net operating losses. In determining that a valuation allowance was required, we placed added weight on the operating results of the past two years and projected operating losses for 2005. At the end of 2006, we evaluated the need for the valuation allowance in accordance with our valuation allowance reversal methodology and in conjunction with SFAS 109. We concluded that as a result of sustained profitability, which was evidenced by consecutive quarters of net income along with projections of pre-tax income in future years, that the criteria had been met for the full reversal of the valuation allowance.            Effective January 1, 2007, we began to measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48). The expanded disclosure requirements of FIN 48 are presented in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.            FIN 48 prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of this Interpretation. FIN 48 also provides guidance on accounting for    32           derecognition, interest and penalties, and classification and disclosure of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes. As in the past, changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from pre-acquisition years for acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill. Adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined.            Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets.     As discussed in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142) requires that we review and test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis, rather than amortize them. We may be required to review and test for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, SFAS 142 requires us to: (1) allocate goodwill to our various business units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of those businesses to which goodwill relates; and (3) determine the carrying value of the businesses. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular business unit, then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business unit. This requires the identification of any previously unrecognized intangible assets. When this process is completed, the amount of goodwill impairment is determined. We determine the fair value based upon discounted cash flows prepared for each reporting unit. Cash flows were developed for each reporting unit based on assumptions including revenue growth expectations, gross margins, operating expense projection, working capital and capital expense requirements and tax rates. Rather than computing probabilistic cash flow outcomes to account for risk in the cash flow forecasts, the impact of risk was used in developing the discount factor.            In addition, SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS 144) requires us to test the recoverability of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In testing for potential impairment under SFAS 144, if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows, we must then determine the amount by which the fair value of those assets exceeds the carrying value and determine the amount of impairment, if any.            SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141) requires us to record acquisition transactions in accordance with the purchase method of accounting, and therefore requires us to use judgment and estimates related to the allocation of the purchase price to the intangibles assets of the acquisition and the remaining amount, net of assets and liabilities assumed, to goodwill.            Stock-Based Compensation.     As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, effective January 1, 2006, we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS 123R) using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized includes: (a) compensation expense for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS 123), recognized over the remaining vesting period and (b) compensation expense for all share-based awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R recognized over the vesting period. In accordance with the modified-prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated.            Prior to January 1, 2006, we applied APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25) and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation    33           plans. Since stock options were issued with an exercise price equal to the fair market price on the grant date, no compensation expense was recorded related to stock options.            Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS 123, which recognizes expense based on the fair value on the date of grant.     Results of Operations             The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of revenues:             Year Ended December 31,             2005     2006     2007       Revenues     100.0  %  100.0  %  100.0  %       Cost of services     73.4     72.9     68.3                           Gross profit     26.6     27.1     31.7          Selling, general and administrative expenses     27.0     23.6     26.8                           Operating (loss) income     (0.4  )  3.5     4.9          Interest expense     0.0     0.0     (1.9  )       Interest income     0.3     0.5     0.2          Change in fair value of interest rate swap     0.0     0.0     (0.2  )                        Income (loss) before income taxes     (0.1  )  4.0     3.0          Provision (benefit) for income taxes     (0.1  )  0.2     1.4                           Net (loss) income     (0.0  )%  3.8  %  1.6  %                           Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2007        Revenues.              Year Ended December 31,     Change             2007     2006     $     %          Revenues by segment:                                        Life Sciences     $  134,622,000     $  117,462,000     $  17,160,000     14.6  %    Healthcare        175,079,000        170,104,000        4,975,000     2.9  %    Physician (from January 3, 2007)        74,599,000                74,599,000     N/A       IT and Engineering (from January 31, 2007)        182,880,000                182,880,000     N/A                                  Total Revenues     $  567,180,000     $  287,566,000     $  279,614,000     97.2  %                              34        NAME="page_dg10801_1_35">                            Consolidated year-over-year revenue growth is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of VISTA and Oxford, completed on January 3, 2007 and January 31, 2007, respectively, and includes revenues from their respective date of acquisition. We also experienced organic growth in our Life Sciences and Healthcare segments. These organic results were due to both demand in our end markets as well as an expanded and more experienced sales and fulfillment team. Our Healthcare segment revenues began to slow in the latter half of the year, driven by slower than expected progress in replacing a large account that closed its acute care facility following its failure to gain government certification, our reduction in placements at another large customer due to pricing, as well as a generally lackluster Nurse Travel end market. We have made management changes and realigned certain geographic markets to facilitate generating a better growth rate in the segment on a go-forward basis. We will continue to focus on the growth of our established product lines as well as our newer product lines, including Health Information Management, Clinical Research, Engineering, Local Nursing, Physician, IT and Engineering, and further development of our direct hire business. We believe the growth of these service offerings will help support further organic growth and diversify our client base.            Revenues increased $279,614,000, or 97.2 percent, from $287,566,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $567,180,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was due in great part because of the acquisitions of VISTA and Oxford, which accounted for $257,479,000 of the increase. In addition, conversion and direct hire fee revenues increased $4,943,000, or 75.2 percent, from $6,571,000, or 2.3 percent of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $11,514,000, or 2.0 percent of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2007. This was a result of more contract professionals being converted into or hired directly as permanent employees in our legacy businesses, accounting for $1,967,000 of the increase, as well as from conversion and direct hire fee revenues generated in the newly acquired Physician and IT and Engineering segments, which accounted for $2,976,000 of the increase. Continued development of the direct hire business had a favorable impact on our operating results and will remain a focus of management.            Life Sciences segment revenues increased $17,160,000, or 14.6 percent, from $117,462,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $134,622,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a 7.6 percent increase in average bill rates, or approximately $8,968,000, as well as a 5.0 percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment, or approximately $5,897,000. In addition, conversion and direct hire fee revenues increased $1,219,000, or 22.3 percent, from $5,465,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $6,684,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our newer service line offerings, Clinical Research and Engineering, continued to grow by generating a larger number of higher-level, higher-revenue placements during 2007 than 2006, with a 17.7 percent increase in contract professionals placed in 2007 than in 2006.            The overall increase in Healthcare segment revenues, which include our Nurse Travel and Allied Healthcare lines of business, resulted from an increase in revenues generated by the Allied Healthcare line of business while the Nurse Travel line remained relatively flat for the period. Healthcare segment revenues increased $4,975,000, or 2.9 percent, from $170,104,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $175,079,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Allied Healthcare revenues increased $4,743,000, or 9.4 percent, from $50,491,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $55,234,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a 13.0 percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment, or approximately $6,537,000, as well as a 67.6 percent increase in conversion and direct hire fee revenues from $1,106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $1,854,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was offset by a 6.6 percent decrease in hours worked per contract professional, or approximately $5,037,000. Nurse Travel revenues increased $232,000, or 0.2 percent, from $119,613,000 for the year ended December 31,    35          2006 to $119,845,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The slight increase in Nurse Travel revenues was due to a 1.0 percent increase in the average bill rate, offset by a 2.6 percent decrease in average hours worked per nurse and a 0.4 percent decrease in average contract professionals on assignment.             Physician segment revenues, which consist of the recently acquired VISTA, were $74,599,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Physician segment revenue was 13.2 percent of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. The Physician segment had fourth quarter 2007 revenues of $19,362,000, an increase of 14.6 percent over the pro-forma fourth quarter revenue of 2006.            IT and Engineering segment revenues, which consist of the recently acquired Oxford, were $182,880,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. IT and Engineering segment revenue was 32.2 percent of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. The IT and Engineering segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $53,290,000, an increase of 16.1 percent over the pro-forma fourth quarter of 2006.

Gross margins increased 460 basis points from 27.1 percent to 31.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. On a consolidated basis, gross profit and gross margins increased significantly due the acquisitions of VISTA and Oxford completed on January 3, 2007 and January 31, 2007, respectively, and includes gross profit from their respective date of acquisition. The 460 basis point increase in consolidated gross margin year over year is largely attributable to the 37.4 percent gross margin earned in the IT and Engineering segment, which consists entirely of the Oxford acquisition. Additionally, we experienced margin improvement in both of our historical segments, Life Sciences and Healthcare.            Life Sciences segment gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006 due to an increase in revenues and improved gross margin. Gross margins for the segment increased 90 basis points from 32.5 percent to 33.4 percent for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The Life Sciences segment gross margin increase was primarily related to lower workers' compensation expense, an increased bill/pay spread and increased direct hire and conversion fee revenues. Direct hire and conversion fee revenues increased $1,219,000, or 22.3 percent, from $5,465,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $6,684,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Increases in direct hire and conversion fee revenues have a positive impact on gross margin as there are no associated costs of services. Gross margins in the first quarter of a year tend to be lower than the fourth quarter of the preceding year due to the reset of certain payroll taxes.    36                  Healthcare segment gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006 due to an increase in revenues and improved gross margin. This segment includes gross profit from the Nurse Travel and Allied Healthcare lines of business. Gross margin for the segment increased 200 basis points from 23.3 percent to 25.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The increase was primarily related to an increase in the bill/pay spread, reduced housing and travel costs, lower workers' compensation expense and increased direct hire and conversion fee revenues, partially offset by an increase in temporary employee per diem expense. Direct hire and conversion fee revenues in the Allied Healthcare line of business increased $748,000, or 67.6 percent, from $1,106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $1,854,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross margins in the first quarter of a year tend to be lower than the fourth quarter of the preceding year due to the reset of certain payroll taxes.             Gross margins in our Physician and IT and Engineering segments were 29.2 percent and 37.4 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007, and as with our other divisions to the extent we employ contract professionals we may see lower gross margins in the first quarter due to the reset of certain payroll taxes.            Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.     Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses include field operating expenses, such as costs associated with our network of staffing consultants and branch offices for our Life Sciences and Allied Healthcare lines of business, including staffing consultant compensation, rent and other office expenses, as well as marketing and recruiting for our contract professionals. Nurse Travel SG&A expenses include compensation for regional sales directors, account managers and recruiters, as well as rent and other office expenses and marketing for traveling nurses. SG&A expenses from our Physician and IT and Engineering segments include compensation for sales personnel associated with VISTA and Oxford, as well as rent and other office expenses and marketing for these segments. SG&A expenses also include our corporate and branch office support expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, recruiting and training expenses for field staff, marketing staff expenses, rent, expenses related to being a publicly-traded company and other general and administrative expenses.             SG&A expenses increased $84,042,000, or 123.8 percent, from $67,900,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $151,942,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The primary reason for the increase was the acquisitions of VISTA and Oxford in the first quarter of 2007. SG&A expenses for VISTA and Oxford were $19,411,000 and $57,527,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to expenses related to increased sales headcount and corporate support personnel associated with the acquisitions, the amortization of intangible assets acquired caused an increase in amortization expense from $957,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $15,342,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Amortization expense for 2008 is expected to decrease to approximately $9,509,000. Additionally, stock-based compensation expense was $2,953,000 for year ended December 31, 2006 versus $6,359,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. We do not expect a significant increase in stock-based compensation expense for 2008. Our integration strategy, which is designed to minimize the disruption to the operations of VISTA and Oxford, is going as planned. Going forward, we will continue to maximize our SG&A synergies in areas such as infrastructure, field office support and marketing.            Total SG&A as a percentage of revenues increased from 23.6 percent in the 2006 period to 26.8 percent in the 2007 period, primarily due to increased amortization expense related to the acquisition of VISTA and Oxford. We do not expect a significant increase to SG&A on a go-forward basis.    37                  Interest expense, interest income and other expense.     Interest expense was $54,000 and $10,968,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The increase in interest expense was due to the new $165,000,000 senior secured credit facility we entered into on January 31, 2007. For further discussion regarding the new credit facility, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report.            Interest income was $1,698,000 and $1,394,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Interest income in the current period was lower due to a lower average cash balance in 2007 versus 2006. Average interest rates were marginally higher in the 2007 period versus the 2006 period.             On May 2, 2007, we entered into a transaction with a financial institution that fixes the underlying rate on $73,000,000 of our outstanding bank loan for a period of two years beginning June 30, 2007. This transaction, commonly known as a swap, essentially fixes our base borrowing rate at 4.9425 percent as opposed to a floating rate, which resets at selected periods. The current base rate on the loan balance in excess of $73,000,000, which will be reset on March 31, 2008, is 4.83 percent. The new base rate for this portion of the debt will depend on the conditions we choose at the time. The borrowing rate consists of the base rate plus an incremental rate, currently 2.25 percent, which is dependent on several factors, including the amount we borrowed and the amount of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) we are generating. On December 31, 2007, the value of the swap was marked-to-market, and we recorded a loss of $1,206,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The loss is shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8 of this report as the change in fair value of interest rate swap, and the related liability of $1,206,000 is shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Part II, Item 8 of this report in other long-term liabilities.            Benefit/Provision for Income Taxes.     The provision for income taxes increased from $541,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $7,493,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a tax provision based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 44.6 percent while our effective rate was 4.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2006. The difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the corresponding period in 2007 was primarily due to the reversal in 2006 of the valuation allowance of $4,928,000 that was recorded against our net deferred income tax assets in 2004 and 2005. Of the $4,928,000 valuation allowance reversal, $4,345,000 resulted in an income tax benefit and $583,000 was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital resulting from stock option deductions realized in the 2006 period.    Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2006        Revenues.              Year Ended December 31,     Change             2006     2005     $     %          Revenues by segment:                                        Life Sciences     $  117,462,000     $  98,730,000     $  18,732,000     19.0  %    Healthcare        170,104,000        139,126,000        30,978,000     22.3  %                                 Total Revenues     $  287,566,000     $  237,856,000     $  49,710,000     20.9  %                                         Revenues increased $49,710,000, or 20.9 percent, from $237,856,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $287,566,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The most significant revenue driver is the number of contract professionals on assignment. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a 15.8 percent increase in the average number of contract    38           professionals on assignment and an overall 5.0 percent increase in average bill rates. In addition, conversion and direct hire fee revenues increased $2,127,000, or 47.9 percent, from $4,444,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $6,571,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of more contract professionals being converted into or hired directly as permanent employees.            Our year-over-year revenue growth is a result of both improved demand in our end markets as well as an expanded and more experienced sales and fulfillment team. Specifically, demand in our Nurse Travel line of business strengthened significantly.            Life Sciences segment revenues increased $18,732,000, or 19.0 percent, from $98,730,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $117,462,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an 11.8 percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment, as well as a 5.4 percent increase in average bill rates. In addition, conversion and direct hire fee revenues increased $1,704,000, or 45.3 percent, from $3,761,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $5,465,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our conversion and direct hire fee revenues were higher as more contract professionals were converted into or hired directly as permanent employees.            Healthcare segment revenues increased $30,978,000, or 22.3 percent, from $139,126,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $170,104,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Nurse Travel revenues increased $20,522,000, or 20.7 percent, from $99,091,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $119,613,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in Nurse Travel revenues was due, in part, to a 23.6 percent increase in the average number of nurses on assignment and an increase in bill rates of 2.2 percent, offset by a 2.7 percent decrease in average hours worked per nurse. The Nurse Travel results include a decrease in revenues derived from hospitals that experienced labor disruptions for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $1,915,000 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Allied Healthcare revenues increased $10,456,000, or 26.1 percent, from $40,035,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $50,491,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a 18.9 percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and an increase in bill rates of 4.3 percent, as well as a 61.9 percent increase in conversion and direct hire fee revenues from $683,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $1,106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006.       Gross Profit and Gross Margins.              Year Ended December 31,             2006     2005             Gross Profit     Gross Margin     Gross Profit     Gross Margin          Gross Profit by segment:                                     Life Sciences     $  38,143,000     32.5  %  $  31,736,000     32.1  %    Healthcare        39,698,000     23.3  %     31,493,000     22.6  %                                   Total Gross Profit     $  77,841,000     27.1  %  $  63,229,000     26.6  %                                           Gross profit increased $14,612,000 from $63,229,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $77,841,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to an increase in both revenues and gross margins. Gross margins increased 50 basis points from 26.6 percent to 27.1 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Consolidated gross margins were positively impacted by our decision to focus the sales and fulfillment team on the development of our direct    39           hire business. Direct hire revenues have no associated cost of services. Therefore, growth in our direct hire revenues, as well as conversion fee revenues, had a favorable impact on gross margins.            Life Sciences segment gross profit increased $6,407,000 from $31,736,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $38,143,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to an increase in both revenues and gross margins. Gross margins for the segment increased 40 basis points from 32.1 percent to 32.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Life Sciences gross margins were positively impacted by our decision to focus the sales and fulfillment team on the development of the direct hire business. Conversion and direct hire fee revenues have no associated cost of services. Therefore, growth in our direct hire revenues, as well as conversion fee revenues, had a favorable impact on gross margins. The increases in gross margins were partially offset by increased payroll taxes and a slight increase to workers' compensation expense and holiday pay.            Healthcare segment gross profit increased $8,205,000 from $31,493,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $39,698,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Gross margins for the segment increased 70 basis points from 22.6 percent to 23.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. This segment includes gross profit from the Nurse Travel and Allied Healthcare lines of business. Gross margins for the segment increased due in part to a change in the segment's service mix towards the higher gross margin lines of business. Allied Healthcare revenues increased as a percentage of segment revenues from 28.8 percent to 29.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005 to 2006, respectively. Nurse Travel gross margins increased from 20.1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005 and to 20.5 percent for the year ended December 31, 2006. This slight increase in Nurse Travel gross margin was primarily attributable to the higher bill/pay spreads, offset by increased travel expenses for nurses on assignment. Allied Healthcare gross margins increased from 29.0 percent to 30.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Allied Healthcare gross margins increased due to a 9.6 percent increase in bill/pay spreads and additional conversion and direct hire fee revenues, offset by an increase in payroll taxes as well as travel and housing expenses.             Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.     Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses include field operating expenses, for Life Sciences and Allied Healthcare, including staffing consultants' compensation, rent, other office expenses and marketing for contract professionals. Nurse Travel SG&A expenses include compensation for regional sales directors, account managers and recruiters, as well as rent, other office expenses and marketing for traveling nurses. SG&A expenses also include our corporate and branch support expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, recruiting and training expenses for field staff, marketing staff expenses, rent, expenses related to being a publicly-traded company and other general and administrative expenses.             SG&A expenses increased $3,765,000, or 5.9 percent, from $64,135,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $67,900,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was due to an increase of $2,729,000 in field operating expenses, and an increase of $1,036,000 in corporate expenses. The increase in field operating expenses was primarily the result of increased staffing consultant salaries, commissions and bonuses in the 2006 period versus the 2005 period due to higher field headcount and increased revenues offset partially by a decrease to marketing and advertising expenses. The increase in corporate expenses is primarily due to an increase of $2,718,000 in stock-based compensation expense. This increase was partly offset by decreases in depreciation and amortization expense, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expense and loss on the disposal of property and equipment.    40                  Total SG&A as a percentage of revenues decreased from 27.0 percent in the 2005 period to 23.6 percent in the 2006 period, primarily due to a larger percentage increase in revenues than SG&A expenses.            Interest Income.     Interest income, net, increased from $681,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $1,644,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates resulting from a change in investment strategy from lower yielding tax-exempt investments to other higher return short-term investments, as well as a higher average cash balance carried in 2006. The net proceeds from the November equity offering of $71,678,000 were included in the increased cash balance.            Benefit/Provision for Income Taxes.     We went from a net loss position in 2005 to a net income position in 2006. Income taxes increased from a benefit of $129,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, to a provision of $541,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our effective rate was 4.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 57.3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005. The difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the corresponding period in 2005, was primarily due to the reversal in 2006 of the valuation allowance of $4,928,000 that was recorded against our net deferred income tax assets in 2004 and 2005. Of the $4,928,000 valuation allowance reversal, $4,345,000 resulted in an income tax benefit and $583,000 was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital resulting from stock option deductions realized in the current year.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             Our working capital at December 31, 2007 was $79,009,000, including $37,764,000 in cash and cash equivalents. On January 3, 2007, we acquired VISTA Staffing Solutions, Inc. (VISTA), a privately-owned, leading provider of physician staffing and permanent physician search services. On January 31, 2007, we acquired Oxford Global Resources, Inc. (Oxford), a leading provider of high-end information technology and engineering staffing services. The Oxford acquisition was completed by utilizing our existing cash and the proceeds from a new $165,000,000 senior secured credit facility. The new facility includes a 5-year $20,000,000 revolving credit facility, which was un-drawn at closing and as of December 31, 2007, and a 7-year $145,000,000 funded term loan facility. The term loan facility is repayable at the minimum rate of $347,000 per quarter. In addition, we are required to reduce the term loan by up to 50 percent of our excess cash flow, as defined by the agreement for each year end over the next seven years. During 2007, we used $9,087,000 to pay down our bank loan to $135,913,000, including an $8,000,000 payment on December 31, 2007 against the principal balance of the term loan. This payment was sufficient to cover the excess cash flow payment required by the bank as well as all minimum quarterly payments for 2008. As such, no portion of the loan is payable during 2008. Under the credit facility, we are required to maintain certain financial covenants, including a minimum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Additionally, the agreement, which is secured by our assets, provides for certain limitations on capital expenditures.             While capital raised through our stock offering in 2006 and our debt financing in 2007 has enabled us to execute strategic growth objectives, our operating cash flows have been our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs. Our working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivable, payroll expenses and the required periodic payments of principal and interest on the $135,913,000 term loan as of December 31, 2007. We do not currently pay cash dividends on our outstanding common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.    41                  Cash provided by operations increased $19,356,000 from $14,302,000 in 2006 to $33,658,000 in 2007. Accounts receivable increased in 2007 primarily due to the acquisition of VISTA and Oxford. We made net tax payments during the year of $9,586,000 to reduce income taxes payable for the legacy businesses and Oxford, which was offset by the provision for the current year.             Cash used for investing activities was $234,024,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $229,391,000 over the 2006 period. Included in the cash used for investing activities was $232,273,000 net cash paid for the acquisition of VISTA and Oxford in the current year. Also, there was $5,899,000 in capital expenditures related to information technology projects, leasehold improvements and various property and equipment purchases in 2007 compared to $4,111,000 in 2006. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $9,000,000 for 2008. This use of cash was offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $4,678,000 in conjunction with the credit facility we entered into, as the restricted cash previously collateralized in association with three letters of credit related to our workers' compensation program was released.            Cash provided by financing activities was $132,139,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, which consisted primarily of the proceeds from our debt financing agreement of $145,000,000 as well as the gross proceeds from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of common stock options of $2,598,000, partially offset by $9,725,000 principal payments of long-term debt, $4,153,000 of debt issuance costs and $1,997,000 for the repurchase of common stock.            Barring unexpected changes in U.S. labor markets and demand for our services, we believe that our working capital as of December 31, 2007, the financing arrangement entered into on January 31, 2007 and positive cash flow from future operating activities will be sufficient to fund future debt obligations, accounts payable and related payroll expenses as well as capital expenditure initiatives for the next twelve months.            We have accrued $2,205,000 and $6,320,000 for the estimated payment of the earn-outs related to the 2007 operating performance of VISTA and Oxford, respectively. Payment of the earn-outs is tentatively scheduled for April 2008, pending the agreement of applicable parties to all terms and provisions related to such payments. There is potential for additional consideration of $5,795,000 contingent upon the 2008 financial performance of VISTA and $5,680,000 contingent upon the 2008 financial performance of Oxford.             We continue to make progress on enhancements to our front-office and back-office information systems. These enhancements include the consolidation of back-office systems across all corporate functions, as well as enhancements to and broader application of our front-office software across all lines of business. We currently do not expect to undertake the full integration of information systems used by VISTA and Oxford. However, such integration will remain a consideration of management.            On June 15, 2001, our board of directors authorized the repurchase, from time to time, of up to 2,940,939 shares of On Assignment Inc.'s common stock. As of December 31, 2003, we had repurchased 2,662,500 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $22,970,000. We did not repurchase any shares pursuant to this authorization for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 or 2006. In December 2007, we repurchased 278,439 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $1,997,000. As of December 31, 2007, we have no remaining authorization to repurchase shares.            During 2007, certain stock-based awards issued under our approved stock option plan vested. Under the provisions of this plan, a portion of the vested shares were withheld by us in order to satisfy minimum payroll tax obligations of the employee. The vested shares withheld have been recorded as treasury stock, a reduction to stockholder's equity, at the fair market value on the date that the tax obligation was determined, which was also the vesting date of the awards. As of    42           December 31, 2007, there were 97,999 shares withheld related to stock-based awards and included in treasury stock at a fair-market value of $1,033,000.    Commitments and Contingencies             We lease space for our corporate and branch offices. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007 was $4,575,000, $5,109,000 and $8,822,000, respectively.            The following table sets forth, on an aggregate basis, at December 31, 2007, the amounts of specified contractual cash obligations required to be paid in the periods shown (in thousands):       Contractual Obligations       2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     Thereafter     Total    Long-term debt     $       $  1,387     $  1,387     $  1,387     $  1,387     $  130,365     $  135,913    Operating lease obligations     $  6,641     $  6,003     $  4,019     $  2,088     $  860     $  2,213     $  21,824    Accrued earn-out payments     $  8,525     $       $       $       $       $       $  8,525                                        Total     $  15,166     $  7,390     $  5,406     $  3,475     $  2,247     $  132,578     $  166,262               For additional information about these contractual cash obligations, see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Interest payments related to our bank debt are not set forth in the table above. We expect interest expense related to the loan to decrease slightly going forward as the principal balance is paid off.            We have accrued $2,205,000 and $6,320,000 for the estimated payment of the earn-outs related to the 2007 operating performance of VISTA and Oxford, respectively. Payment of the earn-outs is tentatively scheduled for April 2008, pending the agreement of all applicable parties to all terms and provisions related to such payments. These costs have been included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Part II, Item 8 of this report in other accrued expenses. There is potential for additional consideration of $5,795,000 that is contingent upon the 2008 financial performance of VISTA. There is also potential for additional consideration of $5,680,000 that is contingent upon the 2008 financial performance of Oxford. These additional potential earn-outs have been excluded from the table above and will be recorded as additional purchase price in the future at such time when the targets are met and the consideration is earned.            We are partially self-insured for our workers' compensation liability related to the Life Sciences and Healthcare segments as well as its medical malpractice liability in relation to the Physician segment. In connection with this program, we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate. The self-insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported. We account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data. Changes in estimates and differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made. The net self-insurance claim liability was approximately $3,551,000 and $8,921,000 at December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively.             As of December 31, 2007, we have an income tax reserve in other long-term liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions of $337,000.            In September 2005, Oxford commenced suit in Massachusetts Superior Court against two former Oxford employees, their new employer, Black Diamond Networks Inc., ("Black Diamond") and its President. Oxford later amended the complaint at various times to add seven other former employees of Oxford (all collectively "Former Employees") and three other additional defendants. The claims involve breach of the Former Employees' confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition agreements, misappropriation of proprietary information, as well as tortious interference with such contracts and advantageous relations and unfair competition. Certain of the defendants have filed counterclaims, which the Company believes to be without legal merit. The    43           court has granted Oxford's six requests for preliminary injunction orders, which have been issued against eight of the Former Employee defendants and Black Diamond. Discovery is ongoing and is extensive. Factual discovery will conclude by March 31, 2008 and trial is scheduled to commence on October 14, 2008. Oxford expects the matter to be tried. Accordingly, legal and expert fees may be significant.            We are involved in various other legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. However, based on the facts currently available, we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material adverse effect on our financial position.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements             As of December 31, 2007, the Company had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for consistently measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective beginning January 1, 2008, and the provisions of SFAS 157 will be applied prospectively as of that date. We are currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations when it becomes effective in 2008, but we do not expect it will have a significant impact on the financials at this time.             In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 159 "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" (SFAS 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 was effective beginning January 1, 2008, and the provisions of SFAS 159 will be applied prospectively as of that date. We are currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations when it becomes effective in 2008, but we do not expect it will have a significant impact on the financials at this time.             The disclosure requirements and cumulative effect of adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" are presented in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.            In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R expands the definition of a business, thus increasing the number of transactions that will qualify as business combinations. SFAS 141R requires the acquirer to recognize 100 percent of an acquired business' assets and liabilities, including goodwill and certain contingent assets and liabilities, at their fair values at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration will be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until settled. Likewise, changes in acquired tax contingencies, including those existing at the date of adoption, will be recognized in earnings if outside the maximum allocation period (generally one year). Transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will be expensed as incurred, and any adjustments to finalize the purchase accounting allocations, even within the allocation period, will be shown as revised in the future financial statements to reflect the adjustments as if they had been recorded on the acquisition date. Finally, a gain could result in the event of a bargain purchase (acquisition of a business below the fair market value of the assets and liabilities), or a gain or loss in the case of a change in the control of an existing investment. SFAS 141R will be applied    44           prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after January 1, 2009. Adoption is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations directly when it becomes effective in 2009, as the only impact that the standard will have on recorded amounts at that time is that related to disposition of uncertain tax positions related to prior acquisitions. Following the date of adoption of the standard, the resolution of such items at values that differ from recorded amounts will be adjusted through earnings, rather than through goodwill. Adoption of this statement is, however, expected to have a significant effect on how acquisitions completed on or after January 1, 2009 are reflected in the financial statements.            Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk                 We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business, principally risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates. We are exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Based on the relative size and nature of our foreign operations, we do not believe that a ten percent change in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would have a material impact on our financial statements. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt instruments. On May 2, 2007, we entered into a transaction with a financial institution to fix the underlying rate on $73,000,000 of our outstanding bank loan for a period of two years beginning June 30, 2007. This transaction essentially fixes our base borrowing rate at 4.9425 percent as opposed to a floating rate, which resets at selected periods. Excluding the effect of our interest rate swap agreement, a 1 percent change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately $1,344,000 during year ended December 31, 2007. Had our interest rate swap agreement, effective June 30, 2007, been in effect for the entire period, a 1 percent change in interest rates on variable debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately $664,000 during the year ended December 31, 2007.    45        NAME="page_di10801_1_46">                           Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
