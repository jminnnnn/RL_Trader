ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS          The discussion in this Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, management of growth, particularly in international markets, risks inherent in expansion into new international markets and new professions, the integration of acquired operations, the Company's ability to attract, train and retain qualified Account Managers and temporary employees in the laboratory, science, financial and environmental fields, and other risks discussed in "Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results" in Item 1 of this Annual Report, beginning on page 4, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Report and from time to time in the Company's other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  SEASONALITY          The Company's results have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations. Demand for the Company's temporary employees typically declines from the year-end holiday season through February, resulting in a corresponding decrease in revenues, operating income and net income. Demand for the Company's temporary employees also often declines in June, July and August due to decreases in clients' activity during vacation periods and the availability of students to perform temporary work. As a result, the Company has experienced slower growth or declines in revenues, operating income and net income during the first quarter and from the second quarter to third quarter of prior years.  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1999           REVENUES. Revenues increased by 20.1% from $132,741,000 in the year ended December 31, 1998, to $159,473,000 in the year ended December 31, 1999, as a result of the increased revenues of the Lab Support and the Healthcare Financial Staffing segments.          The growth of the Lab Support segment's revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment and to a lesser extent to an increase in average hourly billing rates during 1999. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment was primarily attributable to the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Lab Support segment has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new offices opened in the past year. The increase in the Lab Support segment's revenues was partially offset by a decrease in the EnviroStaff division's revenues, which was primarily attributable to the continuing transition of the division's business away from serving clients in the remediation business and the resulting planned decline in remediation assignments, partially offset by increases in average hourly billing rates and average weekly hours worked during 1999.          The growth of the Healthcare Financial Staffing segment's revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment and to a lesser extent to an increase in average hourly billing rates during 1999. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment was primarily attributable to the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Healthcare Financial Staffing segment has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new offices opened in the past year.          COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services consists solely of compensation for temporary employees and payroll taxes and benefits paid by the Company in connection with such compensation. Cost of services increased 18.7% from $90,705,000 in 1998 to $107,652,000 in 1999. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased from 68.3% in 1998 to 67.5% in 1999. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in workers' compensation and state unemployment insurance expense in both segments in 1999, partially offset by an increase in employer paid benefits in both segments.          OPERATING EXPENSES. Operating expenses include the costs associated with the Company's network of Account Managers and branch offices, including Account Manager compensation, rent, other office expenses and advertising for temporary employees, and corporate office expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, management compensation, Account Manager recruiting and training expenses, corporate advertising and promotion, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses increased 20.2% from $25,308,000 in 1998 to $30,428,000 in 1999. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues remained consistent at 19.1% in the 1998 and 1999 periods. This result was primarily attributable to leveraging a centralized support system over a larger revenue base, offset by investments in Account Manager training and recruiting, expenses for international expansion into Canada and the UK, and an increase in the hiring of new Account Managers for the opening of new offices and the expansion of existing offices.                                          11      12         INTEREST INCOME. Interest income increased 22.4% from $1,336,000 in 1998 to $1,635,000 in 1999, primarily as a result of interest earned on higher interest-bearing cash, cash equivalent and marketable security account balances in 1999.          PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Provision for income taxes increased 26.9% from $6,748,000 in 1998 to $8,566,000 in 1999. The Company's effective tax rate remained relatively unchanged from 37.4% in 1998 compared to 37.2% in 1999.  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1998          REVENUES. Revenues increased by 23.1% from $107,849,000 in the year ended December 31, 1997, to $132,741,000 in the year ended December 31, 1998, as a result of the increased revenues of the Lab Support and the Healthcare Financial Staffing segments.          The growth of the Lab Support segment's revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment and to a lesser extent to an increase in average hourly billing rates during 1998. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment was primarily attributable to the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Lab Support segment has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new offices opened in the past year. The increase in the Lab Support segment's revenues was partially offset by a decrease in the EnviroStaff division's revenues, which was primarily attributable to the continuing transition of the division's business away from serving clients in the remediation business and the resulting planned decline in remediation assignments, partially offset by increases in revenue from the division's higher margin regulatory compliance business and an increase in average hourly billing rates during 1998.          The growth of the Healthcare Financial Staffing segment's revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment and to a lesser extent to an increase in average hourly billing rates during 1998. The increase in the number of temporary employees on assignment was primarily attributable to the strong performance in most of the markets in which the Healthcare Financial Staffing segment has older, better established branches and to a lesser extent the contribution of new offices opened in the past year.          COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services consists solely of compensation for temporary employees and payroll taxes and benefits paid by the Company in connection with such compensation. Cost of services increased 21.3% from $74,748,000 in 1997 to $90,705,000 in 1998. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased from 69.3% in 1997 to 68.3% in 1998. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in workers' compensation expense and employer payroll taxes in both segments, and an increase in conversion fee revenue (which has no associated cost of services) of both segments in 1998, partially offset by an increase in employer paid benefits. In addition, lower training and medical monitoring expenses in the Lab Support segment's EnviroStaff division, primarily as a result of the transition of the division's business away from remediation assignments, contributed to the decrease in 1998.          OPERATING EXPENSES. Operating expenses include the costs associated with the Company's network of Account Managers and branch offices, including Account Manager compensation, rent, other office expenses and advertising for temporary employees, and corporate office expenses, such as the salaries of corporate operations and support personnel, management compensation, Account Manager recruiting and training expenses, corporate advertising and promotion, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses increased 22.2% from $20,714,000 in 1997 to $25,308,000 in 1998. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 19.2% in 1997 to 19.1% in 1998. This result was primarily attributable to leveraging a centralized support system over a larger revenue base, partially offset by an increase in the hiring of new Account Managers for the opening of new offices and the expansion of existing offices.          INTEREST INCOME. Interest income increased 60.4% from $833,000 in 1997 to $1,336,000 in 1998, primarily as a result of interest earned on higher interest-bearing cash, cash equivalent and marketable security account balances in 1998.          PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Provision for income taxes increased 36.2% from $4,954,000 in 1997 to $6,748,000 in 1998. The Company's effective tax rate remained relatively unchanged from 37.5% in 1997 compared to 37.4% in 1998.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           The Company's primary sources of cash in 1998 and 1999 were funds provided by operating activities. In 1998, operating activities provided $11,622,000 of cash compared to $10,110,000 in 1999. This decrease was primarily attributable to a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a larger increase in accounts receivable, a decrease in income taxes receivable, a larger increase in deferred income taxes, and a decrease in workers' compensation deposits. This                                          12      13 decrease was partially offset by a higher net income and larger increases in depreciation and amortization in 1999 compared to 1998.          Cash used for investing activities totaled $4,716,000 in 1998 compared to $7,934,000 in 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to lower proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities, higher purchases of marketable securities, higher purchases of furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements and a disbursement for officer loan receivable in 1999. This increase was partially offset by cash payments of $808,000 for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of LabStaffers, Inc. in 1998 compared to an installment payment of $360,000 in 1999.          Cash provided by financing activities was $2,472,000 in 1998 compared to cash used for financing activities of $5,770,000 in 1999. The decrease was primarily attributable to repurchases of common stock.          On August 28, 1998, the Company renewed its unsecured bank line of credit. The maximum borrowings allowable under this agreement were $7,000,000 and accrued interest at the bank's reference rate. The Company terminated the line of credit on July 1, 1999. No amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 1998.          The Company believes that its cash balances, together with the funds from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through at least the next twelve months.  YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE          The Company developed and implemented a Year 2000 Readiness Plan to address the Year 2000 issues, particularly with respect to its critical systems. Critical systems are those whose failure poses a risk of disruption to the Company's ability to provide employment for its temporary employees and temporary staffing services to its clients. The Company believes that all critical internal business systems have been upgraded to meet "Year 2000" requirements. The Company has not experienced significant Year 2000 issues subsequent to 1999's fiscal year end and is not aware of any significant Year 2000 issues for which it is not adequately prepared. However, there can be no assurance that the Company's business, operating results or financial condition will not be adversely affected by issues surrounding the Year 2000 conversion. To date, the costs incurred by the Company with respect to Year 2000 compliance have not been material.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company is exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business, principally risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its held to maturity investments. The interest rate risk is immaterial due to the short maturity of those investments. The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Based on the relative size and nature of its foreign operations, the Company does not believe that a ten percent change in foreign currencies would have a material impact on its financial statements.                                          13      14 ITEM 8.
