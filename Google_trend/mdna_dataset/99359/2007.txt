ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS     Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Acts). Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact are deemed to be forward-looking statements.   The forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on current beliefs, estimates, and assumptions concerning the operations, future results, and prospects of the Company. As actual operations and results may materially differ from those assumed in forward-looking statements, there is no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate. Forward-looking statements are subject to the safe harbors created in the Acts.   Any number of factors could affect future operations and results, including, without limitation, competition from other companies; changes in applicable laws, rules, and regulations affecting the Company in the locations in which it conducts its business; the availability of equity and/or debt financing in the amounts and on the terms necessary to support the Companys future business; interest rate trends; determination by the Company to dispose of or acquire additional assets; general industry and economic conditions; events impacting the U.S. and world financial markets and economies; and those specific risks that are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.   - 9 -         GENERAL     We design, develop, and manufacture sophisticated lifting equipment for specialty aerospace and defense applications. With over 50% of the global market, we have long been recognized as the worlds leading designer and supplier of performance-critical rescue hoists and cargo-hook systems. We also manufacture weapons-handling systems, cargo winches, and tie-down equipment. Our products are designed to be efficient and reliable in extreme operating conditions and are used to complete rescue operations and military insertion/extraction operations, move and transport cargo, and load weapons onto aircraft and ground-based launching systems. We have three operating segments which we aggregate into one reportable segment. The operating segments are Hoist and Winch, Cargo Hooks, and Weapons Handling. The nature of the production process (assemble, inspect, and test) is similar for each operating segment, as are the customers and the methods of distribution for the products.   All references to years in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated year unless otherwise specified.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES     The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.   Inventory .  We purchase parts and materials to assemble and manufacture components for use in our products and for use by our engineering and repair and overhaul departments. Our decision to purchase a set quantity of a particular material is influenced by several factors including current and projected cost, future estimated availability, lead time for production of our products, existing and projected contracts to produce certain items, and the estimated needs for our repair and overhaul business.   We value our inventories using the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. We reduce the carrying amount of these inventories to net realizable value based on our assessment of inventory that is considered excess or obsolete based on our full backlog of sales orders and historical usage. Since all of our products are produced to meet specific customer requirements, our focus for reserves is on purchased and manufactured parts.   Environmental Reserves .  We provide for environmental reserves when, after consultation with our internal and external counsel and other environmental consultants, we determine that a liability is both probable and estimable. In many cases, we do not fix or cap the liability for a particular site when we first record it. Factors that affect the recorded amount of the liability in future years include our participation percentage due to a settlement by, or bankruptcy of, other potentially responsible parties, a change in the environmental laws resulting in more stringent requirements, a change in the estimate of future costs that will be incurred to remediate the site, changes in technology related to environmental remediation, and appropriate discount factors to reflect the net present value of expected expenditures.   We discuss current estimated exposures related to environmental claims under the caption Environmental Matters below.   Deferred Tax Asset .  This asset, against which a valuation allowance for a portion of the noncurrent state taxes has been established, represents income tax benefits expected to be realized in the future, primarily as a result of the use of net operating loss carryforwards. Because we expect to generate adequate amounts of taxable income prior to the expiration of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in 2022 through 2025 and 2008 through 2012 respectively, no additional valuation allowance was considered necessary. If we do not generate adequate taxable earnings, some or all of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. Additionally, changes to the federal and state income tax laws also could impact our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards. In such cases, we may need to increase the valuation allowance established related to deferred tax assets for state purposes.   - 10 -         Stock-Based Compensation.  The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123R,  Share-Based Payment , on April 1, 2006, using the modified prospective transition method. FASB Statement No. 123R which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2007, reflect the impact of FASB Statement No. 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Companys consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of FASB Statement No. 123R. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under FASB Statement No. 123R for the year ended March 31, 2007, was $0.4 million, net of tax.   The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Companys consolidated statement of earnings. Prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method related to stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 as allowed under FASB Statement No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation .   Prior to 2006, the Company applied APB Opinion No. 25 and did not recognize compensation expense for stock options granted as the exercise price of the options on the date of grant was equal to their fair market value as of that date. However, for grants of restricted stock, the Company recognized compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the period that the restrictions expired. The fair value of the options granted during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was estimated as $6.83 per common share, $4.12 per common share and $4.26 per common share, respectively. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to stock-based compensation.

Our net sales increased to $73.3 million for fiscal 2007, a 14% increase from net sales of $64.4 million in fiscal 2006. This increase in sales was driven by new equipment and spare parts sales. Increases in sales of approximately $3.3 million in the cargo hook operating segment and approximately $1.4 million in the hoist and winch operating segments accounted for the new equipment sales increase of $4.7 million. Sales growth in the hoist and winch operating segment accounted for approximately all of the 27% increase in spare parts sales. Shipments in the cargo hook operating segment of overhaul and repair increased by approximately $1.4 million, but were offset by approximately $1.7 million of decreased shipments in the hoist and winch operating segment of overhaul and repair.   - 11 -         Cost of Sales .  The three operating segments of hoist and winch, cargo hooks, and weapons handling equipment have generated sales in three components: new equipment, overhaul and repair, and spare parts, each of which has progressively better margins. Accordingly, cost of sales as a percent of sales will be affected by the weighting of these components to the total sales volume. In fiscal 2007, the $40.9 million cost of sales as a percent of sales was approximately 56%. In fiscal 2006, the $36.5 million cost of sales as a percentage of sales was approximately 57%. The 1% decrease was mainly due to the mix of new equipment and spares parts activity in the hoist and winch and cargo hook operating segments.   Gross Profit . As discussed in the Cost of Sales section above, the three components of sales in each of the operating segments have margins reflective of the market. During the last four fiscal years, the gross profit margin on new equipment has been generally in the range of 31% to 35%, with overhaul and repair ranging from 27% to 37% and spare parts ranging from 64% to 68%. The balance or mix of this activity, in turn, will have an impact on overall gross profit and overall gross profit margins. While we saw a significant increase in new equipment sales in the hoist and winch and cargo hook operating segments during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, the overall gross margin was higher by approximately 1% because we also had sales increases in the hoist and winch operating segment for spare parts which carry higher gross margins.   General, Administrative, and Selling Expenses . General, administrative, and selling expenses increased 26% to $19.9 million for fiscal 2007, as compared to $15.8 million for fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to higher planned engineering costs of $2.4 million related to the Companys contracts for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft. The remainder of the increase mainly involves increased spending for marketing efforts and costs related to the implementation of the Section 404 internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These three items accounted for approximately 85% of the $4.1 million increase in general, administrative, and selling expenses.   Loss on Extinguishment of Debt .  In May 2006, we refinanced and paid in full the Former Senior Credit Facility with a new five year, $50.0 million Senior Credit Facility consisting of a $10.0 million revolving credit facility, and two term loans of $20.0 million. As a result of this refinancing, in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a pretax charge of $1.3 million consisting of $0.9 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and $0.4 million for the payment of prepayment premiums. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed the private placement of 2.5 million shares of common stock which allowed us to pay down approximately $17.2 million of our Former Senior Credit Facility (as defined below). The loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal 2006 of $0.4 million represents the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs related to the debt retired.   Interest Expense . The decrease in interest expense of $5.1 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, was the result of the Companys pay down of debt using the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the lower weighted average interest rate resulting from the refinancing. (See discussion of loss on extinguishment of debt above).   Net Income . We reported net income of $4.0 million in fiscal 2007 versus net income of $1.3 million in fiscal 2006. This increase in net income resulted from the reasons discussed above.   New Orders . New orders received during fiscal 2007 totaled $101.5 million, a decrease of $19.3 million, as compared with $120.8 million of new orders received during fiscal 2006. Overall, orders for new equipment decreased approximately $11.4 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, due to decreased orders in the hoist and winch operating segment. Orders were higher in this operating segment during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2007 mainly due to the award of a contract worth approximately $45.0 million from Airbus Deutschland GmbH to develop and manufacture cargo winches and cargo cranes for its new A400M military transport aircraft. In fiscal 2007, new orders related to A400M military transport aircraft totaled $20.5 million representing an order from AAR Cargo Systems to develop and manufacture a retrieval winch system. The decrease in orders for new equipment in the hoist and winch operating segment was partially offset by increases in orders for new equipment of $6.9 million in the cargo hook operating segment and $2.1 million in the weapons handling operating segment. New orders received in overhaul and repair decreased approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, the majority of which was related to the cargo hook operating segment.   Backlog .  Backlog at March 31, 2007 was $119.2 million, an increase of $28.0 million from the $91.2 million at March 31, 2006. The product backlog varies substantially from time to time due to the size and timing of orders. The increase in the backlog is mainly attributable to a $20.5 million order from AAR Cargo Systems to develop and manufacture a retrieval winch system for the Airbus A400M military transport aircraft. This order, plus approximately $45.0 million in orders received in fiscal 2006 directly from Airbus Deutschland GmbH for cargo winches and cargo cranes for the same aircraft will be shipped starting in calendar 2009 and continuing through 2020. We measure backlog by the amount of products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase   - 12 -           from us as of a given date. Approximately $34.2 million of backlog at March 31, 2007 is scheduled for shipment during the next 12 months. The book-to-bill ratio is computed by dividing the new orders received during the period by the sales for the period. A book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.0 is potentially indicative of continued overall growth in our sales. Our book-to-bill ratio for fiscal 2007 was 1.4 as compared to 1.9 for fiscal 2006. The decrease in the book-to-bill ratio was directly related to the higher order intake related to the Airbus A400M Military transport aircraft during fiscal 2006. Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions of product quantities in existing contracts, although seldom occurring, could substantially and materially reduce our backlog. Therefore, our backlog may not represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.   Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005                                                                                                           Fiscal Year Ended         Increase                March 31,         March 31,         (decrease)      (In thousands)         2006         2005         $         %         New Equipment         $    28,644              $    31,527              $    (2,883    )              (9.1    )      Spare Parts              18,834                   19,810                   (   976    )              (4.9    )      Overhaul and Repair              15,736                   11,002                   4,734                   43.0           Engineering Services              1,204                   593                   611                   103.0                                                                          Net Sales              64,418                   62,932                   1,486                   2.4           Cost of Sales              36,457                   36,177                   280                   0.8                                                                          Gross Profit              27,961                   26,755                   1,206                   4.5           General, administrative, and selling expenses              15,789                   17,320                   (1,531    )              (8.8    )      Interest expense              9,320                   10,469                   (1,149    )              (11.0    )      Settlement with U.S. Government                                 1,197                   (1,197    )              (100.0    )      Loss on extinguishment of debt              396                   2,185                   (1,789    )              ( 81.9    )      Net income         $    1,292              $    (2,776    )         $    4,068                   146.5             Net Sales .  Our net sales increased to $64.4 million for fiscal 2006, a 2% increase from sales of $62.9 million for fiscal 2005. Sales in the hoist and winch operating segment accounted for almost all of the $4.7 million increase in overhaul and repair sales. This was a direct result of increased helicopter and fixed wing aircraft usage in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom continuing in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the search and rescue efforts conducted during the natural disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Sales of new equipment decreased $2.9 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due to lower shipments of $1.4 million of new equipment in our weapons handling operating segment. This was primarily due to the completion of the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MRLS) program which was completed in fiscal 2006 and HLU-196 Bomb Hoist program which was completed in fiscal 2005, only partially offset by the commencement of shipments on the HIMARS program. Sales of new production in the cargo hook operating segment decreased 20% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 primarily due to the timing of orders received from customers.   Cost of Sales .  The three operating segments of hoist and winch, cargo hooks, and weapons handling equipment have sales of new equipment, overhaul and repair, and spare parts, each of which has progressively better margins. Accordingly, the cost of sales as a percentage of sales will be affected by the weighting of these components to the total sales volume. In fiscal 2006, compared to fiscal 2005, the cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 1% due to the higher level of overhaul and repair activity in the hoist and winch and cargo hooks operating segments. In addition, operating improvements in this area helped to lower the cost of sales.   Gross Profit .  As discussed in the cost of sales section above, the three components of sales in the operating segments have margins reflective of the market. During the last four fiscal years, the gross profit margin on new equipment was generally in the range of 29% to 33%, overhaul and repair 27% to 40%, and spare parts 64% to 67%. The balance or mix of this activity will, in turn, have an impact on gross profit and gross profit margins. In fiscal 2006, compared to fiscal 2005, the improvement of the gross profit margin of approximately 1% was due to a higher level of sales of the overhaul and repair component in the hoist and winch and cargo hook operating segments.   - 13 -         General, Administrative, and Selling Expenses . General, administrative, and selling expenses decreased 9% to $15.8 million for fiscal 2006 from $17.3 million for fiscal 2005. As a result of the settlement of the United States Attorneys investigation into our overhaul and repair operation, we incurred approximately $1.4 million less in presettlement legal and investigative costs in fiscal 2006 than in fiscal 2005. Our insurance premiums were approximately $0.4 million lower during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due to a change in insurance carriers and market conditions. Legal costs related to the New York Stock Exchanges delisting and appeal were approximately $0.2 million lower in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year. Expenses related to previously divested divisions were approximately $0.9 million lower in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, due to tax matters and a settlement of a claim involving an insurance broker. As a result of order intake timing, selling and engineering costs were approximately $0.2 million lower in fiscal 2006 as compared to the same period last year. The reductions in the items mentioned above were partially offset by higher depreciation and consulting costs, primarily on our new enterprise resource planning system of approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Due to higher sales and operating income, incentive compensation was approximately $0.8 million higher in fiscal 2006 than fiscal 2005.   Interest Expense . Interest expense decreased $1.2 million to $9.3 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to $10.5 million in fiscal 2005 resulting primarily from the decreased aggregate interest rate from our refinancing in November 2004. The effect on interest expense from the repayment of debt in February 2006 using the proceeds from our private placement of common stock also contributed slightly to the reduction in interest expense.   Loss on Extinguishment of Debt .  In February 2006, we completed the private placement of 2.5 million shares of common stock which allowed us to pay down approximately $17.2 million of our existing debt. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.4 million represents the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs related to the debt retired.   Net Income . We generated net income of $1.3 million in fiscal 2006 versus a net loss of $2.8 million in fiscal 2005 which primarily resulted from the reasons discussed above.   New Orders . New orders received in fiscal 2006 totaled $120.8 million, an increase in excess of 100% over fiscal 2005 new orders of $57.1 million. Orders for new equipment in the hoist and winch and cargo hook operating segments were approximately $49.6 million higher during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 mainly due to the award of approximately $45.0 million for a contract from Airbus Deutschland GmbH to develop and manufacture cargo winches and cargo cranes for its new A400M military transport aircraft. We also experienced an increase of approximately 37% in our new production weapons handling equipment from new orders placed on the HIMARS program. New orders placed for overhaul and repair and spares in the hoist and winch and cargo hook operating segments increased approximately $16.4 million mainly due to the reasons stated in the Sales discussion above. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of new orders for spares in the weapons handling operating segment of $2.5 million.   Backlog .  Backlog at March 31, 2006 was $91.2 million, up $56.1 million from $35.1 million at March 31, 2005. The increase in the backlog is mainly attributable to the Airbus order mentioned above and increased new production orders in our hoist and winch operating segment and spares and overhaul and repair orders for the weapons handling operating segment. We measure backlog by the amount of products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us as of a given date. The book-to-bill ratio is computed by dividing the new orders received during the period by the sales for the period. A book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.0 is potentially indicative of continued overall growth in our sales. Our book-to-bill ratio for fiscal 2006 was 1.9 compared to 0.91 for fiscal 2005. The increase in the book-to-bill ratio was directly related to the higher order intake during fiscal 2006. Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions of product quantities in existing contracts, although seldom occurring, could substantially and materially reduce our backlog. Therefore, our backlog may not represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.   Liquidity and Capital Resources     The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and our Senior Credit Facility. Our liquidity requirements depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the timing of production under our contracts with the U.S. Government. Our working capital needs fluctuate between periods as a result of changes in program status and the timing of payments by program. Our capital spending program is budgeted at less than $2.0 million for fiscal 2008. Additionally, as our sales are generally made on the basis of individual purchase orders, our liquidity requirements vary based on the timing and volume of orders.   See discussion below for the terms related to our Senior Credit Facility.   Our common stock is listed on the AMEX under the trading symbol BZC.   - 14 -         Working Capital     Our working capital at March 31, 2007 was $23.1 million compared to $17.1 million at the beginning of fiscal 2007. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.1 to 1.0 at March 31, 2007, compared to 1.8 to 1.0 at the beginning of fiscal 2007.   Working capital changes during fiscal 2007 resulted from an increase in cash of $2.0 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.3 million, an increase in inventory of $2.5 million, an increase in deferred income tax assets of $4.8 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $2.7 million and a decrease in accrued interest of $0.4 million. In addition, the current portion of our total debt increased $3.8 million.   The most significant impact on the $2.0 million cash increase was the timing of shipments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 whereby more shipments were made earlier in quarter than in the prior period. The decrease in accounts receivable reflects the collection of amounts due from customers based on the above mentioned shipping pattern, as well as the collections made on the high volume of shipments that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The increase in inventory is due to parts being purchased in advance for shipments scheduled to be made in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, and a focus on having certain common sub-assemblies on hand that are included in the sales forecast. The increase in deferred tax assets reflects the reclassification from noncurrent to current resulting from expected utilization of NOLs during fiscal 2008. The decrease in accounts payable reflects the payments to vendors for the high volume of purchases made in late fiscal 2006 in order to meet shipping demands in March 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The decrease in accrued interest resulted from the pay down of debt using the proceeds from the issuance of 2.5 million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and the lower weighted average interest rate resulting from the refinancing of the Former Senior Credit Facility on more favorable terms in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The increase in the revolving credit facility and the current portion of long-term debt reflects the working capital demands of the Company and the classification of the monthly mandatory principal payments and prepayment provisions under the term portion of our Senior Credit Facility.   The number of days that sales were outstanding in accounts receivable decreased to 52.2 days at March 31, 2007, from 68.8 days at March 31, 2006. The decrease in days was attributable to the 11% higher shipments made in March of fiscal 2006 as compared to March of fiscal 2007. Inventory turnover decreased slightly to 1.99 turns from 2.02 turns at March 31, 2006. In anticipation of the continuation of the strong sales pattern in fiscal 2007, we are increasing inventory to meet the shipping schedule of the first quarter of fiscal 2008.   Capital Expenditures     Cash paid for additions to property, plant and equipment was $1.1 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The Company initiated the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system late in fiscal 2004 and completed the project during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The total cost of the new system was approximately $3.6 million and will be amortized primarily over a period of five years.   Senior Credit Facility     On May 1, 2006, we refinanced and paid in full the Former Senior Credit Facility with a new five year $50.0 million senior credit facility (the Senior Credit Facility) consisting of a $10.0 million revolving credit facility, and two term loans of $20.0 million each, which had a blended interest rate of 8.6% at March 31, 2007. As a result of this refinancing, in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a pretax charge of $1.3 million consisting of $0.9 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and $0.4 million for the payment of prepayment premiums. The term loans require monthly principal payments of $0.2 million, an additional quarterly principal payment of $50,000, and a mandatory prepayment for fiscal 2007 of approximately $2.0 million, as discussed below. The remaining payments under the term loans are due at maturity. Accordingly, the balance sheet reflects $5.1 million of current maturities due under term loans of the Senior Credit Facility as of March 31, 2007.   The Senior Credit Facility contains certain mandatory prepayment provisions in the event of extraordinary income, the issuance of equity in the Company, or items which are linked to cash flow. The cash flow provision requires prepayment of the Senior Credit Facility in an amount equal to 50% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) less principal payments, interest payments, tax payments, capital expenditures and, with respect to our fiscal year 2007, certain environmental remediation payments and the final payment to the U.S. Government pursuant to a settlement with the government concluded   - 15 -           September 8, 2005. Each such prepayment is applied first to the outstanding principal of one of the term loans up to a certain recapture amount, then ratably to the outstanding principal of all of the term loans until paid in full, and then to the outstanding  principal of the revolving credit facility. It is expected that a mandatory prepayment for fiscal 2007 of approximately $2.0 million will be required under this provision in June 2007, and we expect to have sufficient cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to make this payment. Achievement of the targeted adjusted EBITDA goal for fiscal 2008 of $15.9 million should result in a further pay down of debt of $7.0 million during fiscal 2008.   The Senior Credit Facility prohibits the payment of dividends. The Senior Credit Facility is secured by all our assets. At March 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the provisions of the Senior Credit Facility. At March 31, 2007, there was $3.3 million in outstanding borrowings and $6.7 million in availability, under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility.   Amortization of loan origination fees on the Senior Credit Facility and the Former Senior Credit Facility, and another credit facility refinanced during fiscal 2005, amounted to $0.1 million, $0.6 million, and $0.8 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.   We have long-term debt maturities of $3.1 million, $3.0 million, $3.0 million, and $23.6 million in fiscal 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. These maturities reflect the payment terms of the Senior Credit Facility.   Former Senior Credit Facility     At March 31, 2006, we had a senior credit facility consisting of a $10.0 million asset-based Revolving Credit Facility and two tranches of Term Loans totaling $41.6 million and had a blended interest rate of 16.0% (Former Senior Credit Facility). The terms of this facility required monthly principal payments of $0.3 million over the term of the loan with the balance due at the end of the term on May 31, 2008. On February 17, 2006, we completed a private placement of 2.5 million shares of our common stock which yielded net cash proceeds of $17.2 million which was used to pay down part of this facility. The Former Senior Credit Facility was secured by all of our assets. At March 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the provisions of this facility.   TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES     At March 31, 2007, we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $50.8 million and $89.7 million, respectively, which are due to expire in fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2012, respectively. The state NOL due to expire in fiscal 2008 is approximately $3.0 million. These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through their respective expiration dates and thereby reduce or eliminate our federal and state income taxes otherwise payable. A corresponding valuation allowance of $5.9 million has been established relating to the state NOL, as it is our belief that it is more likely than not that a portion of the state NOLs are not realizable. Failure to achieve sufficient taxable income to utilize the NOLs would require the recording of an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets.   The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), imposes significant limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the event of an ownership change as defined under section 382 of the Code (the Section 382 Limitation). The Section 382 Limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre-ownership NOLs that a corporation may use to offset its post-ownership change income. The Section 382 Limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporations stock immediately before an ownership change by the long-term tax-exempt rate (as published by the Internal Revenue Service). Generally, an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership by value of that corporation by one or more 5% shareholders (including specified groups of shareholders who, in the aggregate, own at least 5% of that corporations stock) exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year testing period. We believe that we have not gone through an ownership change that would cause our NOLs to be subject to the Section 382 Limitation.   If we do not generate adequate taxable earnings, some or all of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. Additionally, changes to the federal and state income tax laws also could impact our ability to use the NOLs. In such cases, we may need to revise the valuation allowance established related to deferred tax assets for state purposes.   - 16 -         SUMMARY DISCLOSURE ABOUT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS     The following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations for the next several fiscal years (in thousands):                                                                                                                              Payments Due By Period                                    Less Than                                                 More Than                Total         1 Year         1-3 Years         3-5 Years         5 Years         Debt principal repayments (a)         $    37,807              $    5,057              $    6,114              $    26,636              $               Estimated interest payments on long-term debt (b)              10,503                   3,006                   5,153                   2,344                              Operating leases              298                   103                   130                   65                                                                                                             Total         $    48,608              $    8,166              $    11,397              $    29,045              $                                                                                                                      (a)         Obligations for long-term debt reflect the requirements of the Term Loans under the Senior Credit Facility. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which is included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.           (b)         Estimated interest payments on long-term debt reflect the scheduled interest payments of the Term Loans under the Senior Credit Facility and assume an effective weighted average interest rate of 8.6%, the Companys blended interest rate at March 31, 2007.        INFLATION     While neither inflation nor deflation has had, and we do not expect it to have, a material impact upon operating results, we cannot assure you that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future.   CONTINGENCIES     Environmental Matters    We evaluate the exposure to environmental liabilities using a financial risk assessment methodology, including a system of internal environmental audits and tests and outside consultants. This risk assessment includes the identification of risk events/issues, including potential environmental contamination at Company and off-site facilities; characterizes risk issues in terms of likelihood, consequences and costs, including the year(s) when these costs could be incurred; analyzes risks using statistical techniques; and, constructs risk cost profiles for each site. Remediation cost estimates are prepared from this analysis and are taken into consideration in developing project budgets from third party contractors. Although we take great care in the development of these risk assessments and future cost estimates, the actual amount of the remediation costs may be different from those estimated as a result of a number of factors including: changes to government regulations or laws; changes in local construction costs and the availability of personnel and materials; unforeseen remediation requirements that are not apparent until the work actually commences; and other similar uncertainties. We do not include any unasserted claims that the Company might have against others in determining the liability for such costs, and, except as noted with regard to specific cost sharing arrangements, has no such arrangements, nor have we taken into consideration any future claims against insurance carriers that the Company might have in determining our environmental liabilities. In those situations where we are considered a de minimis participant in a remediation claim, the failure of the larger participants to meet their obligations could result in an increase in our liability with regard to such a site.   We continue to participate in environmental assessments and remediation work at 11 locations, including certain former facilities. Due to the nature of environmental remediation and monitoring work, such activities can extend for up to 30 years, depending upon the nature of the work, the substances involved, and the regulatory requirements associated with each site. In calculating the net present value (where appropriate) of those costs expected to be incurred in the future, we used a discount rate of 4.9%, which is the 20 year Treasury Bill rate at the end of fiscal 2007 and represents the risk free rate for the 20 years those costs are expected to be paid. We believe that the application of this rate produces a result which approximates the amount that would hypothetically satisfy our liability in an arms-length transaction. Based on the above, we estimate the current range of undiscounted cost for remediation and monitoring to be between $5.4 million and $9.4 million with an undiscounted amount of $6.2 million to be most probable. Current estimates for expenditures, net of recoveries pursuant to cost sharing agreements, for each of the five succeeding fiscal years are $1.6 million, $0.6 million, $0.8 million, $0.8 million, and $0.8 million respectively, with $1.6 million payable thereafter. Of the total undiscounted costs, we estimate that approximately 50% will relate to remediation activities and that 50% will be associated with monitoring activities.   - 17 -         We estimate that the potential cost for implementing corrective action at nine of these sites will not exceed $0.5 million in the aggregate, payable over the next several years, and have provided for the estimated costs, without discounting for present value, in our accrual for environmental liabilities. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we entered into a consent order for a former facility in New York, which is currently subject to a contract for sale, pursuant to which we have developed a remediation plan for review and approval by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. Based upon the characterization work performed to date, we have accrued estimated costs of approximately $1.7 million without discounting for present value. The sale of the property is expected to be concluded upon completion of municipal approvals and soil remediation pursuant to the remediation plan approved by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.   The environmental cleanup plan we presented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 for a portion of a site in Pennsylvania which continues to be owned by us, although the related business has been sold, was approved during the third quarter of fiscal 2004. This plan was submitted pursuant to the Consent Order and Agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PaDEP) concluded in fiscal 1999. Pursuant to the Consent Order, upon its execution, we paid $0.2 million for past costs, future oversight expenses and in full settlement of claims made by PaDEP related to the environmental remediation of the site with an additional $0.2 million paid in fiscal 2001. A second Consent Order was concluded with PaDEP in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 for another portion of the site, and a third Consent Order for the remainder of the site was concluded in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 (the 2003 Consent Order). An environmental cleanup plan for the portion of the site covered by the 2003 Consent Order was presented during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. We are also administering an agreed settlement with the Federal government, concluded in the first quarter of fiscal 2000, under which the government pays 50% of the direct and indirect environmental response costs associated with a portion of the site. We also concluded an agreement in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, under which the Federal government paid an amount equal to 45% of the estimated environmental response costs associated with another portion of the site. No future payments are due under this second agreement. At March 31, 2007, the cleanup reserve was $2.1 million based on the net present value of future expected cleanup and monitoring costs and is net of expected reimbursement by the Federal Government of $0.7 million. The aggregate undiscounted amount associated with the estimated environmental response costs for the site in Pennsylvania is $3.4 million. We expect that remediation at this site, which is subject to the oversight of the Pennsylvania authorities, will not be completed for several years, and that monitoring costs, although expected to be incurred over 20 years, could extend for up to 30 years.   At March 31, 2007, the aggregate amount of undiscounted costs associated with environmental assessments and remediation was $6.2 million. The total environmental liability as disclosed in Schedule II is $5.4 million which includes a discount of $0.8 million at 4.9%.   In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party in four environmental proceedings pending in several states in which it is alleged that we are a generator of waste that was sent to landfills and other treatment facilities. Such properties generally relate to businesses which have been sold or discontinued. We estimate that expected future costs, and the estimated proportional share of remedial work to be performed associated with these proceedings will not exceed $0.1 million without discounting for present value and have provided for these estimated costs in our accrual for environmental liabilities.   Litigation   We are also engaged in various other legal proceedings incidental to our business. It is the opinion of management that, after taking into consideration information furnished by our counsel, these matters will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of our operations, or cash flows in future periods.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS     In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 159 (SFAS 159) The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The Standards objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. Generally accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings. SFAS 159 helps to mitigate this type of accounting-induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value, which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The Standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the Companys choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the Company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS 159 is effective for us on April 1, 2008. The adoption of the provision of SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flow.   - 18 -              In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 106, and 132(R). SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize a net asset for a defined benefit postretirement pension or healthcare plans over funded status or a net liability for a plans under funded status in its balance sheet. SFAS 158 also requires companies to recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in accumulated other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. SFAS 158 was adopted on March 31, 2007. See Footnote 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which is included elsewhere in this Form 10-K related to the adoption of SFAS 158. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end balance sheet, which is consistent with our current practice. This requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. FASB Statement No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FASB Statement No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 157 on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 1.N (SAB 108), Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.  SAB 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify and evaluate the materiality of financial statement misstatements. This SAB establishes a dual approach methodology that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on both the statement of operations and statement of financial position. The SEC has stated that SAB 108 should be applied no later than the annual financial statements for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006, with earlier application encouraged. SAB 108 permits a company to elect either retrospective or prospective application. Prospective application requires recording a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption, as well as detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose. Our application of SAB No. 108 did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.   In June 2006, FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB SFAS Statement No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes , which will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We have evaluated the effect that the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Based on preliminary evaluations, we expect to record a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of April 1, 2007, in the range of $0 to $0.3 million.   In November 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 151,  Inventory Costs . This statement amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43,  Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins, Chapter 4 Inventory Pricing (ARB No. 43) , to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). FASB Statement No. 151 requires that these items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the definition of so abnormal in ARB No. 43. In addition, FASB Statement No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities. FASB Statement No. 151 was effective for the Companys fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.      ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     We are exposed to various market risks, primarily changes in interest rates associated with the Senior Credit Facility which became effective on May 1, 2006. At March 31, 2007, $41.0 million of the Senior Credit Facility was tied to LIBOR and as such, a 1% increase or decrease will have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.4 million based on the amount outstanding under the facility at March 31, 2007.   - 19 -            ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
