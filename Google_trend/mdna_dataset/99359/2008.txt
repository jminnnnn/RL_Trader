ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Acts). Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact are deemed to be forward-looking statements.   This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the information we are incorporating herein by reference contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including information regarding our fiscal 2009 financial outlook, future plans, objectives, business prospects and anticipated financial performance. These forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts and represent only our current expectations regarding such matters. These statements inherently involve a wide range of known and unknown uncertainties. Our actual actions and results could differ materially from what is expressed or implied by these statements. Specific factors that could cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those set forth below and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Given these factors, as well as other variables that may affect our operating results, you should not rely on forward-looking statements, assume that past financial performance will be a reliable indicator of future performance, nor use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. We expressly disclaim any obligation or intention to provide updates to the forward-looking statements and the estimates and assumptions associated with them. Forward-looking statements are subject to the safe harbors created in the Acts.   Any number of factors could affect future operations and results, including, without limitation, competition from other companies; changes in applicable laws, rules, and regulations affecting the Company in the locations in which it conducts its business; the availability of equity and/or debt financing in the amounts and on the terms necessary to support the Companys future business;    10            interest rate trends; a decrease in the United States Government defense spending, changes in spending allocation or the termination, postponement, or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the United States Government; determination by the Company to dispose of or acquire additional assets; general industry and economic conditions; events impacting the U.S. and world financial markets and economies; and those specific risks that are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.    GENERAL    We design, develop, manufacture, sell and service sophisticated lifting equipment for specialty aerospace and defense applications. With over 50% of the global market, we have long been recognized as the worlds leading designer, manufacturer, service provider and supplier of performance-critical rescue hoists and cargo hook systems. We also manufacture weapons-handling systems, cargo winches, and tie-down equipment. Our products are designed to be efficient and reliable in extreme operating conditions and are used to complete rescue operations and military insertion/extraction operations, move and transport cargo, and load weapons onto aircraft and ground-based launching systems. We have three operating segments which we aggregate into one reportable segment. The operating segments are Hoist and Winch, Cargo Hooks, and Weapons Handling. The nature of the production process (assemble, inspect, and test) is similar for each operating segment, as are the customers and the methods of distribution for the products.   All references to years in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated year unless otherwise specified.    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES    The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.   Inventory .  We purchase parts and materials to assemble and manufacture components for use in our products and for use by our engineering and repair and overhaul departments. Our decision to purchase a set quantity of a particular material is influenced by several factors including current and projected cost, future estimated availability, lead time for production of our products, existing and projected contracts to produce certain items, and the estimated needs for our repair and overhaul business.   We value our inventories using the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. We reduce the carrying amount of these inventories to net realizable value based on our assessment of inventory that is considered excess or obsolete based on our full backlog of sales orders and historical usage. Since all of our products are produced to meet specific customer requirements, our focus for reserves is on purchased and manufactured parts.   Environmental Reserves .  We provide for environmental reserves when, after consultation with our internal and external counsel and other environmental consultants, we determine that a liability is both probable and estimable. In many cases, we do not fix or cap the liability for a particular site when we first record it. Factors that affect the recorded amount of the liability in future years include our participation percentage due to a settlement by, or bankruptcy of, other potentially responsible parties, a change in the environmental laws resulting in more stringent requirements, a change in the estimate of future costs that will be incurred to remediate the site, changes in technology related to environmental remediation, and the application of appropriate discount factors to reflect the net present value of expected expenditures.   We discuss current estimated exposures related to environmental claims under the caption Environmental Matters below.     11            Deferred Tax Asset .  This asset, against which a valuation allowance for a portion of the noncurrent state taxes has been established, represents income tax benefits expected to be realized in the future, primarily as a result of the use of net operating loss carry forwards. In fiscal 2008, the valuation allowance was decreased by approximately $0.3 million to reflect the utilization of a portion of the state net operating loss carry forwards from the sale of our headquarters facility and plant in February, 2008. Because we expect to generate adequate amounts of taxable income prior to the expiration of the federal and state net operating loss carry forwards in 2022 through 2025 and 2009 through 2012 respectively, no additional valuation allowance was considered necessary. If we do not generate adequate taxable earnings, some or all of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. Additionally, changes to the federal and state income tax laws also could impact our ability to use the net operating loss carry forwards. In such cases, we may need to increase the valuation allowance established related to deferred tax assets for state tax purposes.   Stock-Based Compensation.  The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, on April 1, 2006, using the modified prospective transition method. FASB Statement No. 123R requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The Companys consolidated financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007, reflect the impact of FASB Statement No. 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Companys consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of FASB Statement No. 123R. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under FASB Statement No. 123R for the years ended March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007, was $0.4 million, net of tax.   The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Companys consolidated statement of earnings. Prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method related to stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 as allowed under FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.   Prior to 2006, the Company applied APB Opinion No. 25 and did not recognize compensation expense for stock options granted as the exercise price of the options on the date of grant was equal to their fair market value as of that date. However, for grants of restricted stock, the Company recognized compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the period that the restrictions expired. The fair value of the options granted during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was estimated as $6.80 per common share, $6.83 per common share, and $4.12 per common share, respectively. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to stock-based compensation.

Our net sales increased to $76.0 million for fiscal 2008, an increase of $2.6 million from net sales of $73.3 million in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008 we experienced a shift in product mix whereby sales of new equipment accounted for 59% of total net sales as compared to 46% for fiscal 2007. The $11.4 million increase in net sales of new equipment in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, was driven by $7.9 million higher shipments in the hoist and winch operating segment and approximately $3.0 million and $0.5 million higher shipments in the weapons handling and cargo hook operating segments, respectively. Overhaul and repair net sales, mainly in the cargo hook operating segment, had an overall decrease of approximately $0.4 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to the same period last year. During fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, spare parts sales decreased approximately $8.9 million with shipments in the hoist and winch operating segment accounting for approximately $7.1 million of the decrease and lower shipments of spare parts in the weapons handling and cargo hook operating segments accounting for $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The demand for spare parts remained weak due primarily, we believe, to the delay in passage of the 2008 U.S. Government defense budget, which was authorized by legislation that became effective in late January 2008. The decline in hoist and winch-related spare part sales had the biggest impact on the shift in our product sales mix during fiscal 2008. In recent years, our sales in the second half of the fiscal year have generally exceeded sales in the first half. The timing of U.S. Government awards, the availability of U.S. Government funding and product delivery schedules are among the factors affecting the periods in which sales are recorded.   Cost of Sales .  The three operating segments of hoist and winch, cargo hooks, and weapons handling equipment have generated sales in three components: new equipment, overhaul and repair, and spare parts, each of which has progressively better margins. Accordingly, cost of sales as a percentage of sales will be affected by the weighting of these components to the total sales volume. In fiscal 2008, the $43.5 million cost of sales as a percent of sales was approximately 57%. In fiscal 2007, the $40.9 million cost of sales as a percentage of sales was approximately 56%. The 1% increase was mainly due to the higher level of new equipment activity in the hoist and winch and weapons handling operating segments.   Gross Profit . As discussed in the Cost of Sales section above, the three components of sales in each of the operating segments have margins reflective of the market. During the last four fiscal years, the gross profit margin on new equipment has been generally in the range of 31% to 35%, with overhaul and repair ranging from 27% to 43% and spare parts ranging from 64% to 71%. The balance or mix of this activity, in turn, will have an impact on overall gross profit and overall gross profit margins. The gross margin of 43% for fiscal 2008 as compared to 44% for fiscal 2007 reflects the shift in sales more heavily weighted toward new equipment. While we had better performance, both in cost and pricing in the production of new equipment, spare parts and overhaul and repair sales, for fiscal 2008, the extended delay in certain appropriations associated with the 2008 U.S. Government defense budget, which was authorized by legislation that became effective in late January 2008, presented an obstacle to achieving overall better operating performance, especially in regard to gross margins due to spare part sales having significantly higher gross profit margins than sales of new equipment.   General, Administrative, and Selling Expenses.  General, administrative, and selling expenses were approximately $19.6 million in fiscal 2008 compared to approximately $19.9 million in fiscal 2007, a decrease of approximately $0.3 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower costs related to the implementation of the Section 404 internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and also decreased expenses for marketing and recruiting efforts. These decreases in general, administrative and selling expenses for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 were partially offset by increased expenses relating to the initial phase of the development of a new generation of hoists and expenses associated with a threatened proxy contest which was settled during second quarter of fiscal 2008.   Interest Expense . Required principal payments and strong cash flow allowed us to reduce our Senior Credit Facility during fiscal 2008 by approximately $15.0 million, including the $9.8 million of net proceeds received from the sale of our headquarters facility and plant, as discussed in the Gain on Sale of Facility section below. The overall rate of interest we paid on our outstanding Senior    13           Credit Facility declined approximately 2% during fiscal 2008. The reduction of debt coupled with the decline in interest rate is reflected in the $0.9 million decrease in interest expense during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. We are also in the process of negotiating a new senior credit facility. Through this facility, and assuming stable interest rates, we expect to lower the annualized interest expense on our debt in fiscal 2009 by an amount in excess of $1.0 million.   Gain on Sale of Facility.  In February 2008, we completed the transaction for the sale of our headquarters facility and plant in Union, New Jersey, for $10.5 million, before selling expenses. The net cash proceeds received at closing of approximately $9.8 million were used to pay down the term portion of our Senior Credit Facility (as defined below). The transaction resulted in a realized pre-tax gain, net of sale expenses, of approximately $6.8 million, and a deferred gain of approximately $1.7 million. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the sale of the facility. As part of the sale agreement we have entered into a lease back of the facility for up to two years after closing. We are currently in the process of selecting a new site which will be better suited to our current and expected needs. We believe we will be able to enter into a lease for an alternative location at market terms.   Loss on Extinguishment of Debt .  In May 2006, we refinanced and paid in full the former senior credit facility with a new five year, $50.0 million Senior Credit Facility consisting of a $10.0 million revolving credit facility, and two term loans of $20.0 million. As a result of this refinancing, in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a pretax charge of $1.3 million consisting of $0.9 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and $0.4 million for the payment of prepayment premiums.   Net Income . We reported net income of $9.4 million in fiscal 2008, which included a pretax gain of $6.8 million from the sale of our headquarters facility and plant versus net income of $4.0 million in fiscal 2007, which included a pretax charge of $1.3 million related to the refinancing of the Companys debt. This increase in net income resulted from the reasons discussed above. In response to the order patterns mentioned below, in the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated certain cost cutting measures in an effort to improve operating results for fiscal 2008. These measures involved a net reduction in our headcount of 14 people or about 7% of our work force. The personnel reductions were carefully considered and we believe that the headcount reductions did not inhibit our ability to meet the sales volume in fiscal 2008.   New Orders . New orders received during fiscal 2008 totaled $81.1 million as compared to $101.5 million of new orders received during fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2007, new orders related to the A400M military transport aircraft totaled $21.5 million representing an order from AAR Cargo Systems to develop and manufacture a retrieval winch system. Excluding the new order related to the A400M military transport aircraft, orders of new equipment in the hoist and winch operating segment increased approximately $7.3 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. This increase was offset by a decline in orders for new equipment in the cargo hook operating segment of approximately $2.9 million, notwithstanding the award of a $3.2 million firm-fixed price contract for one hundred and forty (140) C-160 Cargo Hooks for the CH-47 Aircraft. Orders of new equipment in the weapons handling operating segment had a slight increase of approximately $0.1 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and was attributable to the award of a $5.2 million contract for the manufacture and support of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) rocket pod loading hoists for the U.S. Army.   New orders for overhaul and repair decreased approximately $5.4 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 with $4.5 million due to decreased orders in the hoist and winch operating segment and $0.9 million of decreased orders in the cargo hook operating segment.   New orders for engineering in the weapons handling operating segment were approximately $6.3 million in fiscal 2008, as compared to $0.1 million in fiscal 2007. This increase was the direct result of a $3.7 million contract for the system design and development of a recovery winch for the Field Recovery and Maintenance Recovery Vehicle (FRMV) being developed for the U.S. Army under the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program.   During fiscal 2008, as compared to the prior fiscal year, orders for spare parts in the hoist and winch operating segment declined approximately $4.5 million and orders for spare parts in the cargo hook operating segment declined by approximately $1.0 million. The demand for spare parts was weak during fiscal 2008, we believe, due to a delay associated with the approval of the 2008 U.S. Government Defense budget, which was authorized by legislation that became effective in late January 2008. This is reflected in the booking of new orders for spare parts totaling approximately $16.3 million, which was $5.1 million less than the amount booked in fiscal 2007.  14            Backlog .  Backlog at March 31, 2008 was $124.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million from the $119.2 million at March 31, 2007. The increase in the backlog is mainly attributable to a $3.7 million contract for the system design and development of a recovery winch for the Field Recovery and Maintenance Recovery Vehicle (FRMV) being developed for the U.S. Army under the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. Also included in the backlog at March 31, 2008 are three orders totaling approximately $65.0 million related to the Airbus A400M aircraft. These three orders are scheduled to be shipped starting in late calendar 2009 and continuing through 2020. The product backlog varies substantially from time to time due to the size and timing of orders. We measure backlog by the amount of products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us as of a given date. Approximately $37.1 million of backlog at March 31, 2008 is scheduled for shipment during the next 12 months. The book-to-bill ratio is computed by dividing the new orders received during the period by the sales for the period. A book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.0 is potentially indicative of continued overall growth in our sales. Our book-to-bill ratio for fiscal 2008 was 1.1 as compared to 1.4 for fiscal 2007. The decrease in the book-to-bill ratio was directly related to the higher order intake related to the A400M military transport aircraft totaling $21.5 million in fiscal 2007. Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions of product quantities in existing contracts, although seldom occurring, could substantially and materially reduce our backlog. Therefore, our backlog may not represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.

Our net sales increased to $73.3 million for fiscal 2007, a 14% increase from net sales of $64.4 million in fiscal 2006. This increase in sales was driven by new equipment and spare parts sales. Increases in sales of approximately $3.3 million in the cargo hook operating segment and approximately $1.4 million in the hoist and winch operating segments accounted for the new equipment sales increase of $4.7 million. Sales growth in the hoist and winch operating segment accounted for virtually all of the 27% increase in spare parts sales. Shipments in the cargo hook operating segment of overhaul and repair increased by approximately $1.4 million, but were offset by approximately $1.7 million of decreased shipments in the hoist and winch operating segment of overhaul and repair.   Cost of Sales .  The three operating segments of hoist and winch, cargo hooks, and weapons handling equipment have generated sales in three components: new equipment, overhaul and repair, and spare parts, each of which has progressively better margins. Accordingly, cost of sales as a percent of sales will be affected by the weighting of these components to the total sales volume. In fiscal 2007, the $40.9 million cost of sales as a percent of sales was approximately 56%. In fiscal 2006, the $36.5 million cost of sales    15            as a percentage of sales was approximately 57%. The 1% decrease was mainly due to the mix of new equipment and spare parts activity in the hoist and winch and cargo hook operating segments.   Gross Profit . As discussed in the Cost of Sales section above, the three components of sales in each of the operating segments have margins reflective of the market. During the last four fiscal years, the gross profit margin on new equipment has been generally in the range of 31% to 35%, with overhaul and repair ranging from 27% to 37% and spare parts ranging from 64% to 68%. The balance or mix of this activity, in turn, will have an impact on overall gross profit and overall gross profit margins. While we saw a significant increase in new equipment sales in the hoist and winch and cargo hook operating segments during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, the overall gross margin was higher by approximately 1% because we also had sales increases in the hoist and winch operating segment for spare parts which carry higher gross margins.   General, Administrative, and Selling Expenses . General, administrative, and selling expenses increased 26% to $19.9 million for fiscal 2007, as compared to $15.8 million for fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to higher planned engineering costs of $2.4 million related to the Companys contracts for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft. The remainder of the increase mainly involves increased spending for marketing efforts and costs related to the implementation of the Section 404 internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These three items accounted for approximately 85% of the $4.1 million increase in general, administrative, and selling expenses.   Loss on Extinguishment of Debt .  In May 2006, we refinanced and paid in full our former senior credit facility with a new five year, $50.0 million Senior Credit Facility consisting of a $10.0 million revolving credit facility, and two term loans of $20.0 million. As a result of this refinancing, in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a pretax charge of $1.3 million consisting of $0.9 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and $0.4 million for the payment of prepayment premiums. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed the private placement of 2.5 million shares of common stock which allowed us to pay down approximately $17.2 million of our former senior credit facility. The loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal 2006 of $0.4 million represents the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs related to the debt retired.   Interest Expense . The decrease in interest expense of $5.1 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was the result of the Companys pay down of debt using the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the lower weighted average interest rate resulting from the refinancing of our former senior credit facility. (See discussion at Loss on Extinguishment of Debt above.)   Net Income . We reported net income of $4.0 million in fiscal 2007 versus net income of $1.3 million in fiscal 2006. This increase in net income resulted from the reasons discussed above.   New Orders . New orders received during fiscal 2007 totaled $101.5 million, a decrease of $19.3 million, as compared with $120.8 million of new orders received during fiscal 2006. Overall, orders for new equipment decreased approximately $11.4 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, due to decreased orders in the hoist and winch operating segment. Orders were higher in this operating segment during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2007 mainly due to the award of a contract worth approximately $45.0 million from Airbus Deutschland GmbH to develop and manufacture cargo winches and cargo cranes for its new A400M military transport aircraft. In fiscal 2007, new orders related to A400M military transport aircraft totaled $21.5 million representing an order from AAR Cargo Systems to develop and manufacture a retrieval winch system. The decrease in orders for new equipment in the hoist and winch operating segment was partially offset by increases in orders for new equipment of $6.9 million in the cargo hook operating segment and $2.1 million in the weapons handling operating segment. New orders received in overhaul and repair decreased approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, the majority of which was related to the cargo hook operating segment.   Backlog .  Backlog at March 31, 2007 was $119.2 million, an increase of $28.0 million from the $91.2 million at March 31, 2006. The product backlog varies substantially from time to time due to the size and timing of orders. The increase in the backlog is mainly attributable to a $21.5 million order from AAR Cargo Systems to develop and manufacture a retrieval winch system for the Airbus A400M military transport aircraft. This order, plus approximately $45.0 million in orders received in fiscal 2006 directly from Airbus Deutschland GmbH for cargo winches and cargo cranes for the same aircraft will be shipped starting in calendar 2009 and continuing through 2020. We measure backlog by the amount of products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us as of a given date. Approximately $34.2 million of backlog at March 31, 2007 is scheduled for shipment during the next    16           12 months. The book-to-bill ratio is computed by dividing the new orders received during the period by the sales for the period. A book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.0 is potentially indicative of continued overall growth in our sales. Our book-to-bill ratio for fiscal 2007 was 1.4 as compared to 1.9 for fiscal 2006. The decrease in the book-to-bill ratio was directly related to the higher order intake related to the Airbus A400M Military transport aircraft during fiscal 2006. Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions of product quantities in existing contracts, although seldom occurring, could substantially and materially reduce our backlog. Therefore, our backlog may not represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and our Senior Credit Facility, as defined below. Our liquidity requirements depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the timing of production under our contracts with the U.S. Government. Our working capital needs fluctuate between periods as a result of changes in program status and the timing of payments by program. Additionally, as our sales are generally made on the basis of individual purchase orders, our liquidity requirements vary based on the timing and volume of orders. Based on cash on hand, future cash expected to be generated from operations and the Senior Credit Facility, we expect to have sufficient cash to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months.   Borrowings and availability under the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facility at March 31, 2008 were $2.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively, which included a $1.5 million outstanding letter of credit. See discussion below for the terms related to our Senior Credit Facility. We are also in the process of negotiating a new senior credit facility. Through this facility, and assuming stable interest rates, we expect to lower the annualized interest expense on our debt in fiscal 2009 by an amount in excess of $1.0 million.   In February, 2008, we completed the sale of our headquarters facility and plant in Union, New Jersey. The sales price for the facility was $10.5 million and net proceeds at closing from the sale of the facility of $9.8 million were applied to reduce our Senior Credit Facility. The agreement of sale permits us to lease the facility for up to two years after closing, pending our relocation to a new site, yet to be selected, that will be better suited to our current and expected needs. Accordingly, we are currently leasing the facility. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which is included elsewhere in this Report.   Our common stock is listed on the AMEX under the trading symbol BZC.    Working Capital    Our working capital at March 31, 2008 was $28.5 million compared to $23.1 million at the beginning of fiscal 2008. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.5 to 1.0 at March 31, 2008, compared to 2.1 to 1.0 at the beginning of fiscal 2008.   The major working capital changes during fiscal 2008 resulted from an increase in accounts receivable of $5.0 million, a decrease in inventory of $2.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $1.1 million, a decrease in accrued compensation of $0.5 million, and an increase in other current liabilities of $1.6 million. In addition, the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facility decreased $0.4 million, and the current portion of the term loans under the Senior Credit Facility decreased $2.0 million.   The increase in accounts receivable reflects the high volume of shipments that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, which were 19% higher than shipments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The decreases in inventory and accounts payable are reflective of our current shipment pattern, as we work down the inventory levels that were previously built up to accommodate a product sales mix more heavily weighted toward new equipment sales which requires a longer lead time. The decrease in accrued compensation was primarily due to incentive payments made in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The decrease in the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility reflects the working capital demands of the Company. The decrease in the current portion of our Senior Credit Facility is due to the mandatory prepayment for fiscal 2007 of approximately $2.0 million, as discussed below, which was paid in July 2007. The increase in other current liabilities is predominantly due to the current portion of the deferred gain on the sale of the headquarters facility and plant in Union, New Jersey, and the adoption of the provisions of FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.    17            The number of days that sales were outstanding in accounts receivable increased to 67.3 days at   March 31, 2008, from 52.2 days at March 31, 2007. The increase in days was attributable to the 48% higher shipments made in March of fiscal 2008 as compared to March of fiscal 2007. Inventory turnover increased to 2.24 turns from 2.12 turns at March 31, 2007. The increase in the inventory turns is reflective of the lower inventory levels as discussed above.    Capital Expenditures    Cash paid for additions to property, plant and equipment was $1.0 million and $1.1 million for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively.    Senior Credit Facility    On May 1, 2006, we refinanced and paid in full our former senior credit facility with a new five year $50.0 million senior credit facility (the Senior Credit Facility) consisting of a $10.0 million revolving credit facility, and two term loans of $20.0 million each, which had a blended interest rate of 6.82% at March 31, 2008. As a result of this refinancing, in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a pretax charge of $1.3 million, consisting of $0.9 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and $0.4 million for the payment of prepayment premiums. The term loans require monthly principal payments of $0.2 million, an additional quarterly principal payment of $50,000, and a mandatory prepayment for fiscal 2007 of approximately $2.0 million, as discussed below, which was paid in July 2007. We will not have a mandatory prepayment for fiscal 2008 due to the pay down of principal made from the net proceeds received from the sale of our headquarters facility and plant in Union, NJ, which was completed in February 2008. The remaining payments under the term loans are due at maturity. Accordingly, the balance sheet reflects $3.1 million of current maturities due under term loans of the Senior Credit Facility as of   March 31, 2008.   The Senior Credit Facility contains certain mandatory prepayment provisions in the event of extraordinary income, the issuance of equity in the Company, or items which are linked to cash flow. The cash flow provision requires prepayment of the Senior Credit Facility in an amount equal to 50% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) less principal payments, interest payments, tax payments, capital expenditures and, with respect to our fiscal year 2007, certain environmental remediation payments and the final payment to the U.S. Government pursuant to a settlement with the government concluded September 8, 2005. Each such prepayment is applied first to the outstanding principal of one of the term loans up to a certain recapture amount, then ratably to the outstanding principal of all of the term loans until paid in full, and then to the outstanding principal of the revolving credit facility. A mandatory prepayment for fiscal 2007 of approximately $2.0 million was required under this provision and was paid in July, 2007. We will not have a mandatory prepayment for fiscal 2008 due to the pay down of principal made from the net proceeds received from the sale of our headquarters facility and plant in Union, NJ, which was completed in February 2008.   The Senior Credit Facility prohibits the payment of dividends and is secured by all our assets. The Senior Credit Facility allows us to issue letters of credit against the total borrowing capacity of the facility. At March 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the provisions of the Senior Credit Facility. At March 31, 2008, there was $2.9 million in outstanding borrowings, a $1.5 million outstanding letter of credit and $5.6 million in availability, under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility.   Amortization of loan origination fees on the Senior Credit Facility and the former senior credit facility amounted to $0.1 million, $0.1 million, and $0.6 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.   We have long-term debt maturities of $2.5 million, $0.2 million and $17.1 million in fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. These maturities reflect the payment terms of the Senior Credit Facility.    TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES    At March 31, 2008, we have federal and state net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs, of approximately $30.7 million and $69.0 million, respectively, which are due to expire in fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2012, respectively.    18           The benefit of the state NOL due to expire in fiscal 2009 is approximately $4.5 million. These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through their respective expiration dates and thereby reduce or eliminate our federal and state income taxes otherwise payable. A corresponding valuation allowance of $5.6 million has been established relating to the state NOL, as it is our belief that it is more likely than not that a portion of the state NOLs are not realizable. Failure to achieve sufficient taxable income to utilize the NOLs would require the recording of an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets.   The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), imposes significant limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the event of an ownership change as defined under section 382 of the Code (the Section 382 Limitation). The Section 382 Limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre-ownership NOLs that a corporation may use to offset its post-ownership change income. The Section 382 Limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporations stock immediately before an ownership change by the long-term   tax-exempt rate (as published by the Internal Revenue Service). Generally, an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership by value of that corporation by one or more 5% shareholders (including specified groups of shareholders who, in the aggregate, own at least 5% of that corporations stock) exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year testing period. We believe that we have not gone through an ownership change that would cause our NOLs to be subject to the Section 382 Limitation. However, given our current ownership structure, anyone contemplating an investment in our common stock which would create a new 5% shareholder should consult with their tax adviser when evaluating such an investment.   If we do not generate adequate taxable earnings, some or all of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. Additionally, changes to the federal and state income tax laws also could impact our ability to use the NOLs. In such cases, we may need to revise the valuation allowance established related to deferred tax assets for state tax purposes.    SUMMARY DISCLOSURE ABOUT CONTRACTUAL  OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS    The following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations for the next several fiscal years (in thousands):    Payments Due By Period                                                                                                                                                  Less Than                                                 More Than                Total         1 Year         1-3 Years         3-5 Years         5 Years         Debt principal repayments (a)         $    22,906              $    3,057              $    2,702              $    17,147              $               Estimated interest payments on long-term debt (b)              4,019                   1,469                   2,453                   97                              Operating leases              1,206                   964                   218                   24                              Interpretation 48 obligation, including interest and penalties (c)              350                   350                                                                    Total         $    28,481              $    5,840              $    5,373              $    17,268              $                                        (a)         Obligations for long-term debt reflect the requirements of the Term Loans under the Senior Credit Facility.

See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which is included elsewhere in this Report.        INFLATION     19           While neither inflation nor deflation has had, and we do not expect it to have, a material impact upon operating results, we cannot assure you that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future.    CONTINGENCIES    Environmental Matters    We evaluate the exposure to environmental liabilities using a financial risk assessment methodology, including a system of internal environmental audits and tests, and outside consultants. This risk assessment includes the identification of risk events/issues, including potential environmental contamination at Company and off-site facilities; characterizes risk issues in terms of likelihood, consequences and costs, including the year(s) when these costs could be incurred; analyzes risks using statistical techniques; and, constructs risk cost profiles for each site. Remediation cost estimates are prepared from this analysis and are taken into consideration in developing project budgets from third party contractors. Although we take great care in the development of these risk assessments and future cost estimates, the actual amount of the remediation costs may be different from those estimated as a result of a number of factors including: changes to government regulations or laws; changes in local construction costs and the availability of personnel and materials; unforeseen remediation requirements that are not apparent until the work actually commences; and other similar uncertainties. We do not include any unasserted claims that we might have against others in determining the liability for such costs, and, except as noted with regard to specific cost sharing arrangements, have no such arrangements, nor have we taken into consideration any future claims against insurance carriers that we might have in determining our environmental liabilities. In those situations where we are considered a de minimis participant in a remediation claim, the failure of the larger participants to meet their obligations could result in an increase in our liability with regard to such a site.   We continue to participate in environmental assessments and remediation work at eleven locations, including certain former facilities. Due to the nature of environmental remediation and monitoring work, such activities can extend for up to thirty years, depending upon the nature of the work, the substances involved, and the regulatory requirements associated with each site. In calculating the net present value (where appropriate) of those costs expected to be incurred in the future, we used a discount rate of 4.32%, which is the 20 year Treasury Bill rate at the end of the fiscal 2008 and represents the risk free rate for the 20 years those costs are expected to be paid. We believe that the application of this rate produces a result which approximates the amount that would hypothetically satisfy our liability in an arms-length transaction. Based on the above, we estimate the current range of undiscounted cost for remediation and monitoring to be between $5.4 million and $9.4 million with an undiscounted amount of $6.6 million to be most probable. Current estimates for expenditures, net of recoveries pursuant to cost sharing agreements, for each of the five succeeding fiscal years are $1.6 million, $0.6 million, $1.4 million, $0.8 million, and $0.6 million respectively, with $1.6 million payable thereafter. Of the total undiscounted costs, we estimate that approximately 50% will relate to remediation activities and that 50% will be associated with monitoring activities.   We estimate that the potential cost for implementing corrective action at nine of these sites will not exceed $0.5 million in the aggregate, payable over the next several years, and have provided for the estimated costs, without discounting for present value, in our accrual for environmental liabilities. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we entered into a consent order for a former facility in New York, which is currently subject to a contract for sale, pursuant to which we have developed a remediation plan for review and approval by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. Based upon the characterization work performed to date, we have accrued estimated costs of approximately $1.7 million without discounting for present value. The amounts and timing of such payments are subject to the approved remediation plan.   The environmental cleanup plan we presented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 for a portion of a site in Pennsylvania which continues to be owned, although the related business has been sold, was approved during the third quarter of fiscal 2004. This plan was submitted pursuant to the Consent Order and Agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PaDEP) concluded in fiscal 1999. Pursuant to the Consent Order, upon its execution we paid $0.2 million for past costs, future oversight expenses and in full settlement of claims made by PaDEP related to the environmental remediation of the site with an additional $0.2 million paid in fiscal 2001. A second Consent Order was concluded with PaDEP in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 for another portion of the site, and a third Consent Order for the remainder of the site was concluded in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 (the 2003 Consent Order). An environmental cleanup plan for the portion of the site covered by the 2003 Consent Order was    20            presented during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. We are also administering an agreed settlement with the Federal government, concluded in the first quarter of fiscal 2000, under which the government pays 50% of the direct and indirect environmental response costs associated with a portion of the site. We also concluded an agreement in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, under which the Federal government paid an amount equal to 45% of the estimated environmental response costs associated with another portion of the site. No future payments are due under this second agreement. At March 31, 2008, the cleanup reserve was $2.9 million based on the net present value of future expected cleanup and monitoring costs and is net of expected reimbursement by the Federal Government of $0.5 million. The aggregate undiscounted amount associated with the estimated environmental response costs for the site in Pennsylvania is $3.4 million. We expect that remediation at this site, which is subject to the oversight of the Pennsylvania authorities, will not be completed for several years, and that monitoring costs, although expected to be incurred over twenty years, could extend for up to thirty years.   At March 31, 2008, the aggregate amount of undiscounted costs associated with environmental assessments and remediation was $6.6 million. The total environmental liability as disclosed in Schedule II to this Report is $5.8 million which includes a discount of $0.8 million at 4.32%.   In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party in four environmental proceedings pending in several states in which it is alleged that we are a generator of waste that was sent to landfills and other treatment facilities. Such properties generally relate to businesses which have been sold or discontinued. We estimate that expected future costs, and the estimated proportional share of remedial work to be performed associated with these proceedings, will not exceed $0.1 million without discounting for present value and we have provided for these estimated costs in our accrual for environmental liabilities.   Litigation   We are also engaged in various other legal proceedings incidental to our business. It is the opinion of management that, after taking into consideration information furnished by our counsel, these matters will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of our operations, or cash flows in future periods.    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS    In March 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, does not provide adequate information about how derivative and hedging activities affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Accordingly, SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 161 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R will significantly change the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration, contingencies, acquisition costs, research and development assets and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS 141R, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact income taxes. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 141R is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, An Amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS 160 amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also amends certain of ARB 51s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of SFAS 141R. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The statement shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is initially adopted. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.   In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, providing    21           companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The objective of SFAS 159 is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. Generally accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings. SFAS 159 helps to mitigate this type of accounting-induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value, which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the Companys choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the Company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The effective date of SFAS 159 for our Company is April 1, 2008. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 159 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 106, and 132(R). SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize a net asset for a defined benefit postretirement pension or healthcare plans over funded status or a net liability for a plans under funded status in its balance sheet. SFAS 158 also requires companies to recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in accumulated other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. SFAS 158 was adopted on March 31, 2007. See Footnote 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which is included elsewhere in this Report related to the adoption of SFAS 158. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end balance sheet, which is consistent with our current practice. This requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 158 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 157 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.   In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  An Interpretation of SFAS 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48 are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard. Only tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity) for that fiscal year. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We adopted FIN 48 effective April 1, 2007. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.       ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    We are exposed to various market risks, primarily changes in interest rates associated with the Senior Credit Facility. At March 31, 2008, $25.5 million of the Senior Credit Facility was tied to LIBOR and, as such, a 1% increase or decrease will have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.3 million based on the amount outstanding under the facility at March 31, 2008.    22               ITEM 8.
