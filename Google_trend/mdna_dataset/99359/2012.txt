Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations below.    All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or personsacting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. Except as required by law, we assume no duty to update or revise our forward-looking statements based on changes in internal estimates, expectations, or otherwise.        ITEM 1.  BUSINESS     Breeze-Eastern Corporation, a Delaware corporation, designs, develops, manufactures, sells and services sophisticated engineered mission equipment for specialty aerospace and defense applications. We wereoriginally organized in 1962 as a California corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1986. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the Company, the Registrant, Breeze-Eastern, we orus refer to Breeze-Eastern Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. All references to years in this report refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated year unless otherwise specified. This report reflects alladjustments of a normal recurring nature, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods reflected. Certain prior fiscal year amounts may have been reclassified to conform to thecurrent fiscal year presentation.    CORE BUSINESS    Our core business is aerospace and defense products. We believe we are a leading global designer, manufacturer, service provider, and supplier of mission-critical rescue hoists and cargo hook systems. Wealso manufacture weapons handling systems, cargo winches, and tie-down equipment. These products are sold primarily to military and civilian agencies and aerospace contractors. Our emphasis is on the engineering, assembly, testing, service, andsupport of our products.       3     PRODUCTS AND SERVICES    Our products and related services aggregate into one reportable segment. The nature of the production process (assemble, inspect, and test), customers, and product distribution are similar for allproducts. We sell our products through internal marketing representatives and independent sales representatives and distributors.    PRODUCTS   Products include new equipment and spare parts sales and represented approximately 76%, 74%, and 72% of our total revenuesin fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010, respectively.    As a pioneer of helicopter rescue hoist technology, we continue todevelop sophisticated helicopter hoist and winch systems, including systems for the current generation of Blackhawk, Seahawk, Osprey, Chinook, Ecureuil, Dolphin, Merlin/Cormorant, Super Stallion, Changhe Z-11, Agusta A109, Agusta A119 andAgustaWestland AW139 helicopters. We also design, market, sell and service a broad line of hydraulic and electric aircraft cargo winch systems with capacities from 900 pounds to over 7,000 pounds. Sales of hoist and winch products accounted forapproximately 56%, 57%, and 51% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010, respectively.    Our externalcargo hook systems are original equipment on leading military medium and heavy lift helicopters. These hook systems range from smaller 1,000-pound capacity models up to the largest 36,000-pound capacity hooks employed on the Super Stallionhelicopter. Our latest designs incorporate load sensing and display technology and automatic load release features. We also manufacture cargo and aircraft tie-downs which are included in this product line. Sales of cargo hook products accounted forapproximately 14%, 12%, and 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010, respectively.    We makestatic-line retrieval and cargo winches for military cargo aircraft including the Boeing C-17, Alenia C-27J, and CASA CN-235, and CASA C-295. In addition, we have a contract with Airbus to develop and produce three products for the new cargopositioning and restraint system for the A400M cargo aircraft and expect to be the sole supplier of these products with anticipated delivery beginning in the later part of fiscal 2013.   Once our products are qualified and approved for use with a particular aircraft model, sales of products and services generally continueover the life of the aircraft model, which is usually decades. It is expensive and difficult for a second suppliers product to become qualified and approved on the same aircraft.   Our weapons handling systems include weapons handling equipment for land-based rocket launchers and munitions hoists for loading missilesand other loads using electric power or exchangeable battery packs. We supply this equipment for the United States, Japanese, and European Multiple-Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) and the United States High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). Wealso provide actuators and specialty gearboxes for specialty weapons applications. Sales of weapons handling products accounted for approximately 6%, 5%, and 7% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010, respectively.   SERVICES   Services include overhaul and repair and engineering sales and represented 24%, 26%, and 28% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, fiscal2011, and fiscal 2010, respectively.    We perform overhaul, repair, and maintenance services for all of our products. Most ofthese services are performed at our Whippany, New Jersey facility. We have also licensed third-party vendors around the world to perform these services. Overhaul and repair represented 23%, 22%, and 24% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, fiscal2011, and fiscal 2010, respectively.    In addition to performing research and development to design new products, improveexisting products, and add new features to our product line, we also provide engineering services to adapt our products to customer specific needs and aircraft models on a fee-for-service basis.   We discuss segment information in Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in thisreport.       4     MAJOR CUSTOMERS    We have four major customers: the U.S. Government, United Technologies Corporation, Finmeccanica SpA, and Transaero Inc. which accounted for 29%, 22%, 12%, and 11%, respectively, of the total consolidatednet sales for fiscal 2012.    GOVERNMENT SALES    Our direct sales to the U.S. Government and sales for U.S. Government and foreign government end use represented 76%, 69%, and 67% of consolidated revenue during fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010,respectively. U.S. Government sales, both direct and indirect, are generally made under standard government contracts including fixed price and cost plus. As a U. S. Government contractor, we are subject to routine audits and investigations by U. S.Government agencies.    In accordance with normal practice, contracts and orders with the U.S. Government are subject to partialor complete termination at any time, at the option of the customer. In the event of a termination for convenience by the government, there generally are provisions for recovery of our allowable incurred costs and a proportionate share of the profitor fee on the work completed, consistent with regulations of the U.S. Government.    BACKLOG   We measure backlog by the amount of products or services that customers committed by contract to purchase as of a given date. Backlog atMarch 31, 2012 was $111,184 as compared with $131,151 at March 31, 2011 as new orders exceeded shipments in fiscal 2011. Approximately $77,977 of our backlog at March 31, 2012 is not scheduled for shipment during the next twelvemonths. For additional discussion on our backlog, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    COMPONENTS, RAW MATERIALS, AND SEASONALITY    The various component partsand, to some extent, assembly of components and subsystems by subcontractors used by us to produce our products are generally available from more than one source. In those instances where only a single source for any material or part is available,such items can generally be redesigned to accommodate materials or parts made by other suppliers, although this may lead to delays and higher costs in meeting customer requirements. In some cases, we stock an adequate supply of the single sourcematerials or parts for use until a new supplier can be approved.    In recent years, our revenues in the second half of ourfiscal year have generally exceeded revenues in the first half. The timing of U.S. Government awards, availability of U.S. Government funding, and product deliveries are among the factors affecting the periods in which revenues are recorded.Management expects this trend to continue in fiscal 2013.    EMPLOYEES   As of March 31, 2012, we had 182 salaried and hourly employees, and the United Auto Workers (UAW) represented 52 hourly employees atour facility. We reached a three-year collective bargaining agreement with the UAW in November 2010 and consider our relations, with both our union and non-union employees, to be generally satisfactory.   INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SALES    We currently have no operations based outside of the United States. We had export sales of $31,212, $28,598, and $27,912 in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010, respectively, representing 37%, 37%,and 40% of our consolidated net sales in each of those years. The risks and profitability of international sales are generally comparable with similar products sold by us in the United States. Net export sales by geographic area and customerdomicile are set forth in Note 14 of our financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.       5     COMPETITION    We compete in some markets with the hoist and winch business unit of the Goodrich Corporation, which as a whole is a larger corporation that has substantially greater financial and technical resourcesthan us. Generally, competitive factors include design capabilities, product performance, delivery, and price. Our ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on our ability to develop and apply technological innovations and to expandour customer base and product lines. Technological innovation, development, and application requires significant investment and capital expenditures. While we make each investment with the intent of getting a good financial return, in some cases wemay not fully recover the full investment through future sales of products or services.    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT   We conduct extensive research and development activities, primarily for developing new or improved products, under customer-sponsoredcontracts and with our own funding. Research and development costs, which are charged to Engineering expense when incurred, amounted to $1,057, $1,347, and $1,848 for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.Customer-sponsored research and development costs are charged to cost of sales when the associated revenue is recognized and were $2,096, $2,323, and $3,016 in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010, respectively.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   We have been one of the market leaders since the initial development of rescue hoists for use on helicopters and have continually designedand manufactured rescue hoists since the 1940s. Our intellectual property product knowledge enables us to continually evolve mission-critical products to meet our customers evolving needs. We generally retain the intellectual propertyrights to products we develop which typically lasts for the life of the product.    REGULATORY MATTERS   Aircraft Regulation     In the United States, our aircraft products are required to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals,repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of eachcountry and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).    EnvironmentalMatters     We maintain compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to materials used inproduction and to the discharge of wastes, and other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The costs of such compliance at our Whippany, New Jersey facility are not material to our operations.   We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for the remediation of contaminatedsites relating to predecessor entities and previously-owned subsidiaries. At various times, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980(CERCLA), and analogous state environmental laws, for the cleanup of contamination resulting from past disposals of hazardous wastes at certain former facilities and at sites to which we, among others, sent wastes in the past. CERCLA requirespotentially responsible persons to pay for the cleanup of sites from which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances. Courts have interpreted CERCLA to impose strict joint and several liability on all persons liable forcleanup costs. As a practical matter, however, at sites where there are multiple potentially responsible persons, the costs of cleanup typically are allocated among the parties according to a volumetric or other standard.       6     Where appropriate, we have sought contribution to remediation costs from other potentiallyresponsible parties and made claims under available insurance policies. We also periodically assess the amount of reserves held for environmental liabilities for these sites based upon current information. While there is an inherent uncertainty inassessing the potential total cost to investigate and remediate a given site, we make a determination as to the reasonable cost of investigation and remediation of each site based upon the information available to us at that time. Furthermore, theremediation efforts for a particular site may take place over a number of years and therefore a significant portion of the expenses represented by these reserves may not be incurred for some time. Factors that affect the actual liability for thesesites include changes in federal and state environmental laws resulting in more stringent remediation requirements and actual operating results from remediation efforts which vary from estimated results.   Information concerning our specific environmental liabilities and reserves is contained in Note 13 of our Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.    ADDITIONAL INFORMATION   We maintain a website at http://www.breeze-eastern.com. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports onForm 8-K, and amendments to those reports, which we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available on our web site, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to theSEC. Information that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference in this Report and, accordingly, readers should not consider such information to be part of this Report. The reports noted above may also be obtained at theSECs public reference room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The SEC also maintains a web site at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements, and information regarding SEC registrants, including Breeze-Eastern.        ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS    An investment in our common stock involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to otherinformation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently deem to be material and that we believe are specific to our company and our industry. Inaddition to these risks, our business may be subject to risks currently unknown to us. If any of these or other risks actually occurs, our business may be adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock may decline and you may lose all orpart of your investment.    Risks Associated with our Business and/or Industry   A substantial amount of our revenue is derived from the U.S. Government, Finmeccanica SpA, United Technologies Corporation andTransaero Inc.; a termination or reduction in the volume of business with any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profits.    Approximately 29%, 22%, 12% and 11% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2012 were to the U.S. Government (direct), United Technologies Corporation, Finmeccanica SpA, and Transaero Inc., respectively.These sales are made principally for the benefit of the military services of the U.S. Department of Defense and defense organizations of other countries and are affected by, among other things, budget authorization and appropriation processes. Inthe event that defense expenditures are reduced for products we manufacture or services we provide and are not offset by revenues from additional foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we mayexperience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that our significant customers will continue to buy our productsand services at current or increased levels.    We depend heavily on government contracts that may not be fully funded ormay be terminated, and the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales and increase our costs.    Sales to the U.S. Government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. In fiscal 2012, sales under U.S. Government contracts represented approximately63% of our total sales. Sales to foreign governments represented approximately 14% of our total sales. We expect that the       7     percentage of our revenues from government contracts will continue to be substantial in the future. Government programs can be structured into a series of individual contracts. The funding ofthese programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. In addition, Congress may reduce expenditures for defense programs or terminate such programs any time. A decline ingovernment expenditures or redirection of government funding may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incursubstantial costs redeploying those resources.    As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number ofprocurement rules and regulations and any non-compliance could subject us to fines, penalties or debarment.    We mustcomply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our customers and, in someinstances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, contract termination, or debarment from bidding on future contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed forfailing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue tobe, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of government contracts could harm our business reputation and could also result in progress payments being withheld.   Our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government.   As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. Government agencies, such as the DefenseContract Audit Agency (DCAA). These agencies review a contractors performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of a contractorscompliance with its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will notbe reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties as well as administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts,forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us.   The U.S. Government has the right to terminate or not renew any contract with us at any time and without notice. Any such actionwould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.    In some instances, laws and regulations imposeterms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any government contract and, in general, subcontracts, at itsconvenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs forwork-in-process, and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if contract completion would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost-reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement ofallowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include the cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the workaccomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.    A termination arising from default could expose us toliability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a primecontract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.    In addition, ourU.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the U.S. Government is not satisfied withour performance on the contract.       8     The aircraft manufacturing industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to complywith applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.    Governmental agencies throughout the world,including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, or the FAA, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, althoughcompliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include, with some of the products we sell to our aircraft manufacturing customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicableregulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by ourindividual OEM customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.    From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies inother countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achievecompliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   Cancellations, reductions, or delays in customer orders may adversely affect our results of operations.   Our overall operating results are affected by many factors, including the timing of orders from large customers and the timing ofexpenditures to manufacture parts and purchase inventory in anticipation of future sales of products and services. A large portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed. Cancellations, reductions, or delays in customer orders could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.    Engineering productdevelopment delays or customer engineering product development contract cancellations may adversely affect our results of operations.    Our new product development requires up-front engineering research & development expenditures that impact current income and qualification units that are capitalized as intangible assets on thebalance sheet. These engineering research & development expenditures may not result in future revenue-generating products or may not become technically viable as a result of pre-production qualification testing. These research &development expenditures are generally incurred as a part of awarded new product development for customers aerospace platforms. If the product being designed does not meet customer technical specifications or timely delivery needs, we may needto write-off capitalized qualification units and reimburse customers for their costs that result from our product delivery delay.    Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation at any time without notice, which could negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations.   Backlog represents products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us. Backlog as of March 31,2012 was $111,184. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts with us. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, ourcustomers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Our failure toreplace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.    We are subject tocompetition from entities which could have a substantial impact on our business.    We compete in some markets withentities that are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than us. Generally, competitive factors include design capabilities, product performance, delivery, and price. Our ability to compete successfully in suchmarkets will depend on our ability to develop and       9     apply technological innovations and to expand our customer base and product lines. In addition, the development and application of technological innovations may mandate an expenditure ofsignificant capital which may not be recovered through future sales of products or services. There can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully compete in any or all of the businesses discussed above. Our failure to compete successfullyor to invest in technology where there is no recovery through product sales could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.    Our potential tax benefits from net operating loss carry forwards are subject to a number of risks.    We have federal and state net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) of approximately $9,023 and $489, respectively. Our NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through their respectiveexpiration dates and thereby reduce or eliminate our federal income taxes otherwise payable. If we do not generate adequate taxable earnings, some or all of our net operating loss carry forwards may not be realized. Additionally, changes to thefederal income tax laws also could impact its ability to use the NOLs. The risks to realizing the tax benefit from NOLs are discussed in additional detail in Note 5 of our financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.   We are subject to liability under environmental laws.   Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture,storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and thosewho dispose of materials at waste sites whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsibleparty along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and have taken reserves in ourfinancial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable for these costs. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental investigation and remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantlyvary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our contingencies associated with environmental matters are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements which is included elsewhere in this report.    Our sales to foreign countries expose us to risks andadverse changes in local legal, tax, and regulatory schemes.    In fiscal 2012, 37% of our consolidated sales were tocustomers outside the United States. We expect international export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. The export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the UnitedStates. Such risks include, without limitation:                   The possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations; Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operatingresults;                   Potential negative consequences from changes to significant taxation policies, laws, or regulations; changes in market valuations of other similarlysituated companies;                   Changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements; and                  Political or economic instability, insurrection, civil disturbance, or war.   Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the United States and otherwise adversely affect ourbusiness.    In fiscal 2012, approximately 24% of our sales were subject to compliance with the United States ExportAdministration regulations. Our failure to obtain the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the UnitedStates. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to       10     additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products inEuropean Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing businessinternationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycottprovisions. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment fromgovernment contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.    While webelieve our control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.    We continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls, and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management, including our Chief ExecutiveOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, notabsolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of theinherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities thatjudgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override ofthe controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potentialfuture conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatementsdue to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.    The terms of our credit agreement may restrict our current andfuture operating and financial flexibility.    The credit agreement that is in effect with respect to our debt includescovenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:                   engage in mergers, consolidations and asset dispositions;                  redeem or repurchase stock;                   create, incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;                  create, incur, assume or permit any liens on any asset;                  make loans and investments;                   engage in transactions with affiliates;                   enter into sale and leaseback transactions;                   issue additional shares of our capital stock;                   change our organizational documents; and                   change the nature of our business.    Our credit agreement also contains covenants that require us to:                   maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA not to exceed 2.50:1.00; and                  maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00.       11     We may be unable to comply with the covenants under our credit agreement in the future. Afailure to comply with the covenants under our credit agreement could result in an event of default. In the event of a default our lender could elect to declare all borrowings, accrued and unpaid interest and other fees outstanding, due and payable,and require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.    We are subject to financing and interestrate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business and operating results.    Changes in the availability, termsand cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating could cause the cost of doing business to increase, limit the ability to fund the development of products, and place us at a competitive disadvantage. The currentcontraction in credit markets could impact our ability to finance our operations.    Our operations are conducted at asingle location.    The risk that substantial impairment of our facility as a consequence of a natural disaster or otherevent could have a material adverse effect on operations.    We depend on component availability, subcontractorperformance, and key suppliers to manufacture and deliver our products and services.    We are dependent upon thedelivery of component parts by suppliers and, to some extent, the assembly of components and subsystems used by us in manufacturing our products in a timely and satisfactory manner and to remain in full compliance with applicable terms andconditions. We are generally subject to specific procurement requirements, which may, in effect, limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. In some instances, we are dependent on sole-source suppliers. If any of these suppliers orsubcontractors fails to meet our needs, the development of alternatives could cause delays and increased costs in meeting customer requirements. While we may enter into long-term or volume purchase agreements with certain suppliers and take otheractions to ensure the availability of needed materials, components and subsystems, we cannot be sure that such items will be available in the quantities we require, if at all. If we experience a material supplier or subcontractor problem, theability to satisfactorily and timely meet customer obligations could be negatively impacted, which could result in reduced sales, termination of contracts, and damage to our reputation and customer relationships. We could also incur additional costsin addressing such a problem. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.    Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by the current worldwide economic conditions.    We currently generate operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets, provides discretionary funding capacity. However, current uncertainty in the global economic conditionsresulting from the recent disruption in credit markets poses a risk to the overall economy that could impact consumer and customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers,suppliers, and creditors. If the current economic situation deteriorates significantly, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, or supplier orcustomer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets.    Our future growth and continued success is dependent uponretaining key employees.    Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our abilityto attract and retain other highly qualified management personnel. We face competition for management from other companies and organizations, and therefore may not be able to retain our existing management personnel or fill new management positionsor vacancies created by expansion or turnover at existing compensation levels. We have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management and have made efforts to reduce the effect of the loss of senior managementpersonnel through management succession planning. The loss of senior managers could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and management believesthat our future growth and success will depend upon the ability to attract, train, and retain such personnel.       12     Our profitability could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactorylabor relations.    Approximately 29% of our workforce is employed under a collective bargaining agreement with theUnited Auto Workers (UAW), which from time to time is subject to renewal and negotiation. Although we have historically enjoyed satisfactory relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, if we are subject to labor actions, we mayexperience an adverse impact on our operating results.    Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual propertycould have an adverse effect on our business.    Intellectual property is important to our success. We rely uponconfidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our business and proprietary technology. Our general policy is to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants, and nondisclosure agreements with all otherparties to whom we disclose confidential information. We may apply for legal protection for certain of our other intellectual property in the future. These patents, trademarks and any additional legal protection we may obtain in the future may bechallenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. As a result, our means of protecting our proprietary technology and brands may be inadequate. Furthermore, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent thirdparties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.   As a defense contractor, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized accessto sensitive information; threats to the security of our facility and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there canbe no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure,personnel or capabilities, essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.    Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that couldlead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss ofbusiness or potential liability.    We use estimates when competing for contracts. Variances between actual and estimatescould affect our profitability and overall financial position.    The competitive bidding process requires judgmentrelative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion iscomplicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have tobe made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recordedwhen there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if differentassumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance.   Risks Related to our Common Stock      Our common stock is thinly traded and subject to volatility.   Although our common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT (formerly NYSE Amex), it may remain relatively illiquid, or thinly traded,which can increase volatility in the share price and make it difficult for investors to       13     buy or sell shares in the public market without materially affecting the quoted share price. Further, investors seeking to buy or sell a certain quantity of our shares in the public market may beunable to do so within one or more trading days. If limited trading in our stock continues, it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices.   The prevailing market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyondour control, including the following:                   Actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results;                  Changes in market valuations of other similarly situated companies;                  Announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, orcapital commitments;                   Additions or departures of key personnel;                   Future sales of common stock;                   Any deviations in net revenues or in losses from levels expected by the investment community;                  Trading volume fluctuations; and                   Business pressures on any of our large shareholders resulting from their holdings in other unrelated businesses.   Our share ownership is highly concentrated.    Our directors, officers, and principal stockholders, and certain of their affiliates, beneficially own approximately 63% of our common stock and will continue to have significant influence over theoutcome of all matters submitted to the stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors.    We haveadopted a shareholder rights plan which could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company.    Weadopted a shareholders rights plan which is intended to protect us from efforts to obtain control of the Company that are inconsistent with the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The rights will be exercisable ten days following theearlier of the public announcement that a stockholder has acquired 10% or more of our common stock without Board approval or the announcement of a tender offer which results in the ownership of 10% or more of our common stock. The rights also willbecome exercisable if a person or group that already owns 10% or more of the Companys common stock, without Board approval, acquires any additional shares (other than pursuant to the Companys employee benefit plans). If the rights becomeexercisable, all rights holders (other than the person triggering the rights) will be entitled to acquire Company securities at a substantial discount. Because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attemptingto take over the Company without the approval of the Board of Directors, the rights plan could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company or a significant percentage of the outstanding capital stock, without first negotiatingwith the Board of Directors.    We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.   Any payment of cash dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings (if any), financial condition and capital requirements. We donot have any plans at this time to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any potential investor who anticipates the need for current dividends from its investment should not purchase any of our securities.        ITEM 1B.      UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS     None.       14       ITEM 2.      PROPERTIES     The following table sets forth certain information concerning our sole operating facility as of March 31, 2012:                       Location        Use of Premises      Owned or Leased         Sq. Ft        Whippany, New Jersey      Executive offices and  manufacturing plant         Leased             115,335        In February, 2008, we sold our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in Union, New Jersey. Thesale agreement and amended lease agreement permitted us to lease the facility through May 1, 2010, pending our relocation to a new site. In May, 2009, we executed a 10-year lease, at market terms, for a facility in Whippany, New Jersey, whichis better suited to our current and expected future needs. We completed our relocation to the Whippany site in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and no longer maintain a facility in Union, New Jersey.   Our current business has only been conducted at our previous Union, New Jersey and current Whippany, New Jersey facilities. The propertiesin Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey were operated by one or more of our predecessor affiliates or parent company, TransTechnology Corporation. Our contingencies associated with environmental liabilities are discussed in Note 13 of Notesto Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.    We also own properties in Saltzburg,Pennsylvania and Irvington, New Jersey that are carried on the books at zero value and are not used in operations.    We also owna property in Glen Head, New York which is not used in our operations and is subject to a sale agreement at a price of $4,000. This property is carried on our books as an asset held for sale for $3,800, which includes estimated disposal costs.Closing on the property is subject to the buyer receiving development approvals and us completing environmental obligations and reviews. The buyer has indicated to us its intent to build residential housing on the property and has been engaged inthe lengthy process of securing the municipal approvals necessary to redevelop this industrial site for residential purposes.         ITEM 3.      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     We are engaged in various legal proceedings incidental to our business. Our management, after taking into consideration information provided by our outside legal counsel, believes that these matters willhave no material effect on our consolidated financial position or the results of operations or cash flows in future periods.   We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materialsand remediation of contaminated sites. As a result, we are a party to or have our former property subject to various lawsuits or proceedings involving environmental protection matters. Due in part to their complexity and pervasiveness, suchrequirements have resulted in us being involved with related legal proceedings, claims, and remediation obligations. The extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated at this time. For information regarding thesematters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or clean-up to the extent estimable, see Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.        ITEM 4.     MINE  SAFETY DISCLOSURES     None.       15     PART II        ITEM 5.     MARKET  FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER   PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES    Our common stock, par value $0.01, is listed for trading on the NYSE MKT (formerly NYSE Amex) under thetrading symbol BZC.

On May 7, 2012, the closing sales price of a share of common stock was $8.30 per share.   Dividends    We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since fiscal 2001. We currently intend to retain earnings, if any, to fund our operations and reduce debt. The payment of future cash dividends, ifany, will be reviewed periodically by our Board of Directors and will depend upon the results of operations, financial condition, contractual and legal restrictions and other factors the board of directors deem relevant.       16     Stock Performance Graph   The following Performance Graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that the Companyspecifically incorporates such information by reference into such filing.

All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and except as required bylaw, we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under thecaption Risk Factors beginning on page 6 of this report and elsewhere herein. The following should be read in conjunction with our annual financial statements, including the notes thereto, contained elsewhere in this report. Allreferences to years in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated year unless otherwise specified.   OVERVIEW     We design,develop, manufacture, sell, and service sophisticated engineered mission equipment for specialty aerospace and defense applications. We have long been recognized a leading global designer, manufacturer, service provider, and supplier ofmission-critical rescue hoists. We also manufacture weapons-handling systems, cargo winches, cargo hook systems and tie-down equipment. Our products are designed to be efficient and reliable in extreme operating conditions and are used to completerescue operations and military insertion/extraction operations, move and transport cargo, and load weapons onto aircraft and ground-based launching systems.       18     Our primary strategy is to continue to expand our position as a market leader in the design,development, and service of sophisticated mission equipment for specialty aerospace and defense applications. We intend to maintain our position by continuing to focus on our principal customers and on geographic areas where we have developed ourreputation as a premier provider of aircraft hoist and lift equipment, and by expanding both our customer base and product lines. We believe that continued spending on research and development to improve the quality of our product offerings andremaining on the leading edge of technological advances in our chosen markets is also crucial to our business. In this regard, we will continue to commit resources to product research and development.   Our business is affected by global economic and geo-political conditions. In particular, as the U.S. military activity in Iraq andAfghanistan is reduced, reductions and redirection of United States defense spending could have a material impact on revenues and earnings in future periods. Similarly, if European governments significantly reduce their military and other governmentspending, that could have a material impact on revenues and earnings in future periods. However, we believe that the primary missions that drive procurement and the use of our equipment (search and rescue, special operations, and cargo delivery)will continue to get a relatively high funding priority.    As our OEM customers development timetables have been extended,we have experienced corresponding product development schedule slippage and increased investment. We have not seen, nor do we currently anticipate, any program cancellations and still expect all of our current product development projects to lead toproduction and aftermarket services which support our current and expected investments. As an example, developing the Airbus A400M military transport aircraft has taken longer than was originally expected, but flight testing is now underway, and weexpect revenues related to this project starting in calendar 2013. Our engineering expense is reported net of reimbursements from Airbus, and we anticipate gross engineering costs to continue at a high level.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES    The preparation of our consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and requires us to make estimates, judgments, andassumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, andassumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are materialdifferences between these estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates, assumptions, and judgmentsused in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.    Inventory .    We purchaseparts and materials to assemble and manufacture components for use in our products and for use by our engineering and repair and overhaul departments. The decision to purchase a set quantity of a particular material is influenced by several factorsincluding current and projected cost, future estimated availability, production lead time, existing and projected contracts to produce certain items, and the estimated needs for our overhaul and repair business.   We value inventories using the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. We reduce the carrying amount of theseinventories to net realizable value based on our assessment of inventory that is considered excess or obsolete based on the backlog of sales orders and historical usage. Since all of our products are produced to meet specific customer requirements,the reserve focus is on purchased and manufactured parts.    We relocated our headquarters and manufacturing facility in thefourth quarter of fiscal 2010. As a part of this relocation and prior to our move to the new location, we determined that approximately $2,198 of inventory would not be moved to the new location because it would cost more to relocate and restockthis inventory than its current or projected future market value or utility. These items were physically scrapped before the end of the fiscal year.       19     Because the amount of the inventory scrapped was higher than expected, as evidenced by thedollar value of inventory scrapped being higher than the existing inventory reserves, we reassessed the methodology previously used for estimating inventory obsolescence and determined that a modification was warranted. The previous method forestimating inventory obsolescence was based on estimates of future potential usage based on current usage for each item in inventory.    We determined that a better method of estimating inventory obsolescence is to identify specific items based on the age of inventory and to establish a general reserve based on annual purchases. Analyzinginventory by age, based on the purchase date for raw materials or the completion date for manufactured items, showed little movement once items aged five years, and historical trends showed that 1.1% of purchases would eventually be scrapped.Accordingly, we established a 100% reserve for all inventory on hand at March 31, 2010 that was purchased or manufactured more than five years earlier and for 1.1% of purchases for each of the last five years. Therefore, each $1,000 ofinventory purchased will result in an increase of $11 in inventory reserves. Management periodically reviews this methodology to ensure it is reasonably accurate and will make future adjustments as necessary through current earnings.   In fiscal 2010, the change in methodology resulted in a non-cash adjustment to increase the inventory reserves by $3,311, including the$2,198 discussed above, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The total amount of the inventory reserve change for fiscal 2010 was $3,533 which included increases to inventory reserves in earlier quarters of fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011 weincreased the inventory reserve by $569, and in fiscal 2012 we increased the inventory reserve by $496.    Inventories arediscussed further in Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.   Qualification Units .    We capitalize as intangible assets engineering qualification units, which arepre-production product units that are tested as a part of becoming qualified on an aircraft. Aerospace government regulations stipulate that a product cannot be installed on aircraft until it becomes qualified. The qualification testingdestroys the units, making them unsalable, and as a result the units become intangible assets.   Engineering qualification unitsare ultimately expensed. There can be an extended timing difference between incurring the engineering qualification unit cost and realizing the resulting revenues. Thus, immediately expensing engineering qualification units would not best representthe project economics. Under the matching principle, we amortize the qualification unit costs to expense over future equipment unit shipments. If product testing results in engineering changes, then the technically obsolete qualification units areexpensed in the current period. During fiscal 2012, we expensed $3,165 of costs for impairment of qualification units that became technically obsolete.    Revenue Recognition .    Revenue related to equipment sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured, andpricing is fixed or determinable. Revenue related to repair and overhaul sales is recognized when the related repairs or overhaul are complete and the unit is shipped to the customer. Revenue related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costsincurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred.    EnvironmentalReserves .      We provide for a best estimate of environmental liability reserves when, after consultation with internal and external counsel and other environmental consultants, we determine that aliability is both probable and estimable. In many cases, we do not fix or cap the liability for a particular site when first recorded. Factors that affect the recorded amount of the liability in future years include our participation percentage dueto a settlement by, or bankruptcy of, other potentially responsible parties, a change in the environmental laws resulting in more stringent requirements, a change in the estimate of future costs that will be incurred to remediate the site, andchanges in technology related to environmental remediation. Current estimated exposures related to environmental claims are discussed further in Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in thisreport.

Fiscal 2012 product sales of $64,147 were $6,061, or 10.4%, above the prior year primarily due to increased new production sales of $5,703 primarily from sales of hoist & winch to the U.S.Government. Spare parts sales grew by $433 primarily from cargo hook parts sold to the U.S. Government.    Fiscal 2012 servicessales of $20,795 were $681, or 3.4%, above the prior year primarily due to overhaul and repair of cargo hooks for the U.S. Government, partly offset by lower engineering services.   The timing of U.S. Government awards, availability of U.S. Government funding, and product delivery schedules are among the factors thataffect the period of recording revenues. Fiscal 2012 was consistent with recent years with revenues in the second half of the fiscal year exceeding revenues in the first half of the fiscal year.   Cost of Sales.     Cost of sales for products of $36,488 was 9.1% above the prior year due to increasedsales volume. Cost of services provided of $13,240 was 4.2% lower than the prior year due to lower engineering costs, partly offset by higher costs from increased overhaul & repair volume in fiscal 2012.   We had over-absorbed manufacturing overhead of $403 from higher production volume, with 56% in services and 44% in products. Fiscal 2011had under-absorbed manufacturing overhead of $1,039 due to ramping up production in the fiscal first quarter following our relocation, with approximately 40% in products and 60% in services.   Gross profit.     Gross profit of $35,214 in fiscal 2012 was 13.8% above $30,952 in fiscal 2011. As apercent of sales, gross profit was 41.5% for fiscal 2012 compared with 39.6% for fiscal 2011. The dollar increase is due to higher sales volume as well as to favorable manufacturing overhead absorption compared with the prior year. The improvedgross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to improved engineering gross profit margins as well as to better new equipment and spare parts margins and to favorable manufacturing absorption versus last year.       21     In fiscal 2012, over-absorbed manufacturing overhead added 0.5% points to gross profit as apercent of sales. In fiscal 2011, under-absorbed manufacturing overhead reduced gross profit as a percent of sales by 1.3 % points. Gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal 2011 would have been 40.9% excluding under-absorbed manufacturingoverhead.    Operating Expenses.     Total operating expenses were $28,192, or 33.1% of sales,in fiscal 2012 compared with $21,495, or 27.5% of sales, in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher engineering expenses and also to increased selling expenses.    Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $15,661 in fiscal 2012 versus $14,361 in fiscal 2011. The increase is primarily due to higher selling expenses of commissions and customertraining, meeting, and show costs. General and administrative costs increased by 2.1%.    Engineering expenses, net of customerreimbursement, were $12,531 in fiscal 2012 compared with $6,923 in fiscal 2011. Airbus reimbursed expenses of $3,366 and $734, respectively, in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. Before reimbursement, engineering expenses were $15,897 in fiscal 2012 and$7,657 in fiscal 2011. The $8,240 increase is due to $3,090 of product development primarily for the Airbus A400M, Sikorsky CH53K, and Agusta Westland AW 159; $4,429 for engineering product development discontinuance and qualification unitobsolescence costs, and a $721 accrual for estimated product delivery delay costs.    Fiscal 2011 included $211 of expensesrelated to our relocation.    Interest Expense .    Interest expense was $396 in fiscal 2012,versus $694 in fiscal 2011. The decline in interest expense is primarily due to lower average debt during fiscal 2012 and to a lower effective interest rate due to the interest rate swap expiring in August 2011. The Senior Credit Facility isdiscussed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.   Income tax provision .    Income tax expense was $2,741 in fiscal 2012 versus $3,524 in fiscal 2011, adecrease of $783, due to lower pre-tax income. Income taxes for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were computed using the effective tax rate estimated to be applicable for the full fiscal year. Income taxes and income tax rates are discussed further inNote 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.    NetIncome .    Net income in fiscal 2012 was $3,776, or $0.39 per diluted share, a decrease of $1,250, or 24.9%, versus $5,026, or $0.53 per diluted share, in fiscal 2011. The net income decrease is primarily due to higheroperating expenses, primarily engineering.    New Orders .    New product and services ordersreceived during fiscal 2012 totaled $64,975, a decrease of $14,232 from $79,207 during fiscal 2011. Most of the decrease relates to new equipment as well as overhaul & repair, but spare parts and engineering were also lower. Orders for newequipment decreased by $7,902. Significant orders received in fiscal 2012 included $11,500 for Agusta Westland hoist and winch equipment and spare parts as well as cargo hook equipment, $8,400 for Sikorsky hoist and winch equipment and spare partsas well as cargo hooks, $6,900 for Transaero hoist and winch spare parts and equipment, $6,100 hoist and winch and cargo hook equipment and spare parts, and $2,800 cargo hooks for Boeings Chinook helicopter.   Backlog .     Backlog at March 31, 2012 was $111,184 compared with $131,151 at March 31,2011 as shipments exceeded new orders by $19,967. Significant new orders are discussed in New Orders above. The backlog at March 31, 2012 and 2011 includes approximately $71,343 for the Airbus A400M military transport aircraft thatwas once scheduled to commence shipping in late calendar 2009 and continue through 2020. Airbus now indicates shipments are likely to commence in calendar 2013.    We measure backlog by the amount of products or services that customers committed by contract to purchase as of a given date. Backlog may vary substantially over time due to the size and timing of orders.Backlog of approximately $33,207 at March 31, 2012 is scheduled for shipment during fiscal 2013.    The book-to-bill ratioequals new orders received during a period divided by sales for the same period. Although significant cancellations of purchase orders or substantial reductions of product quantities in existing contracts seldom occur, such cancellations orreductions could substantially and materially reduce backlog. Therefore, backlog information may not represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.       22     A book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.0 is potentially indicative of continued overall growthin sales. The book to bill ratio was 0.8 for fiscal 2012 and 1.0 for fiscal 2011.

Fiscal 2011 product sales of $58,086 were $8,467, or 17.1%, above the prior year primarily due to increased spare parts sales of $8,514 resulting primarily from higher demand by the U.S. military andfrom increased sales to a Canadian third-party overhaul and repair center. New equipment volume was approximately equal to the prior year.    Fiscal 2011 services sales of $20,114 were $706, or 3.6%, above the prior year primarily due to overhaul and repair services increasing by $959, partly offset by lower engineering services.   The timing of U.S. Government awards, availability of U.S. Government funding, and product delivery schedules are among the factors thataffect the period of recording revenues. Fiscal 2010 was consistent with recent years with revenues in the second half of the fiscal year exceeding revenues in the first half of the fiscal year.   Cost of Sales.     Cost of sales for products of $33,434 was 0.9% lower than the prior year primarily dueto the prior-year increase in estimated inventory obsolescence reserves of $3,311, partly offset by increased volume in fiscal 2011. Cost of services provided of $13,814 was 5.6% lower than the prior year because the prior-year amount included $784to accrue for estimated losses on engineering contracts, partly offset by increased volume in fiscal 2011.    Our factoryrelocation in March 2010 resulted in a manufacturing ramp-up period early in the fiscal 2011 first quarter. This resulted in under-absorbed manufacturing overhead, which for the full year was $1,039, with approximately 40% in products and 60% inservices.    Gross profit.     Gross profit of $30,952 in fiscal 2011 was 49.9% above $20,651 infiscal 2010. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 39.6% for fiscal 2011 compared with 29.9% for fiscal 2010. The dollar increase is due to higher sales volume as well as to $5,634 of cost adjustments incurred in the prior year. The increase as apercent of sales is due to a favorable mix of greater spare parts sales and to the prior-year cost adjustments.       23     The prior-year cost adjustments consisted of $3,311 (non-cash) for a change in estimate ofthe inventory obsolescence reserve, $1,539 of under-absorbed manufacturing overhead related to the relocation, and $784 (non-cash) to accrue for estimated losses on engineering contracts. Excluding these adjustments, gross profit as a percent ofsales would have been 38.1% in fiscal 2010.    In fiscal 2011, the under-absorbed manufacturing overhead of $1,039, relatedprimarily to carryover effects of the relocation, reduced gross profit as a percent of sales by 1.3 % points. Gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal 2011 would have been 40.9% excluding under-absorbed manufacturing overhead.   Operating Expenses.     Total operating expenses were $21,495, or 27.5% of sales, in fiscal 2011 comparedwith $27,374, or 39.7% of sales, in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to a non-cash charge for estimated environmental liability reserves of $8,135 in fiscal 2010, partly offset by increases in selling, general, and administrative(SG&A) expenses and engineering costs as well as lower relocation costs. Excluding the environmental charge in fiscal 2010, operating expenses in fiscal 2010 would have been $19,239, or 27.9% of sales.   SG&A expenses were $14,361 in fiscal 2011 versus $20,554 in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2010 SG&A would have been $12,418 excluding theenvironmental charge, and the comparable increase in fiscal 2011 is due to higher incentive compensation accruals based on the plan formula, outside consulting costs, and amortization related to the relocation.   Engineering expenses were $6,923 in fiscal 2011 compared with $6,003 in fiscal 2010. The increase is primarily due to product developmentfor the Airbus A400M and was reduced by $734 in expense reimbursement from Airbus.    We relocated our headquarters and factoryduring the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and incurred $211 of expenses related to the move in fiscal 2011, compared with $817 in fiscal 2010.    Interest Expense .    Interest expense was $694 in fiscal 2011, versus $891 in fiscal 2010. The decline in interest expense is due to $6,572 lower total debt.   Income tax provision (benefit) .    Income tax expense was $3,524 in fiscal 2011 versus an income taxbenefit of $(2,029) in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010 this tax benefit was reduced by state taxes (net of federal benefits) and by converting general business tax credits into net operating loss carryforwards. As described in Note 5 of the Notesto Consolidated Financial Statements, contained elsewhere in this report, several previously-recorded state NOLs expired at the end of fiscal 2010. These expired state NOLs were fully offset by corresponding state valuation allowances; thus,the state tax NOL expirations had no net effect on the Companys effective tax rate. The Companys U.S. Federal statutory tax rate is 35%.    Income taxes and income tax rates are discussed further in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.   Net Income (Loss) .    Net income in fiscal 2011 was $5,026, or $0.53 per diluted share, an increase of$11,069 versus a net loss of $6,043, or ($0.64) per diluted share, in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, excluding the adjustments in gross profit of $5,634 and in SG&A of $8,135 discussed above, net income would have been $2,324, or $0.25 per dilutedshare, and the increase in fiscal 2011 would have been $2,702, or $0.28 per diluted share.    The net income increase to $5,026in fiscal 2011, compared with the adjusted $2,324 in fiscal 2010 is due to the increased sales volume and favorable product mix which improved gross profit and lower interest expenses, partly offset by higher operating expenses.   New Orders .    New product and services orders received during fiscal 2011 totaled $79,207, an increaseof $11,024 over $68,183 during fiscal 2010. Most of this increase was due to spare parts with increases also coming from overhaul and repair and engineering. Orders for new equipment decreased by $560. Significant orders in fiscal 2011 included$9,500 for U.S. Military hoists and winches; $3,764 to upgrade the reactive overload clutch for the U.S. Coast Guard, $3,500 cargo hooks for Boeings Chinook helicopter, $2,280 for Lockheed Martins HIMARS or High Mobility Artillery RocketSystem and $1,940 for Alenias C-27J fixed wing cargo aircraft.       24     New orders for services in overhaul and repair grew by $2,261 due to orders received fromthe U.S. Military. New orders for engineering increased by $1,061 due to weapons handling.   Backlog .     Backlog at March 31, 2011 was $131,151 compared with $130,144 at March 31,2010 as new orders exceeded shipments by $1,007. Significant new orders are discussed in New Orders. The backlog at March 31, 2011 and 2010 includes approximately $71,343 and $69,463, respectively, for the Airbus A400M militarytransport aircraft that was once scheduled to commence shipping in late calendar 2009 and continue through 2020. Airbus now indicates shipments are likely to commence in calendar 2013.   We measure backlog by the amount of products or services that customers committed by contract to purchase as of a given date. Backlog mayvary substantially over time due to the size and timing of orders. Backlog of approximately $43,516 at March 31, 2011 is scheduled for shipment during fiscal 2012.    The book-to-bill ratio equals new orders received during a period divided by the sales for the same period. Although significant cancellations of purchase orders or substantial reductions of productquantities in existing contracts seldom occur, such cancellations or reductions could substantially and materially reduce backlog. Therefore, backlog information may not represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.   A book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.0 is potentially indicative of continued overall growth in sales. The book to bill ratiowas 1.0 for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010.    Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and our Senior Credit Facility. Our liquidityrequirements depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the timing of production under contracts with the U.S. Government. Our working capital needs fluctuate between periods as a result of changes in programstatus and the timing of payments by program. Additionally, because sales are generally made on the basis of individual purchase orders, liquidity requirements vary based on the timing and volume of orders. Based on cash on hand, future cashexpected to be generated from operations, and the Senior Credit Facility, we expect to have sufficient cash to meet liquidity requirements for the next twelve months. The Senior Credit Facility is discussed in Note 6 of the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.    During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, due toour strong cash position, we made one accelerated $821 term loan repayment by pre-paying the amount due in April 2012. Accordingly, the balance sheet reflects current maturities of $2,464 due under the term loan of the Senior Credit Facility as ofMarch 31, 2012.    We are involved in environmental proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil and groundwatercontamination and other environmental matters at several of our former facilities that were never required for our current operations. In fiscal 2013, we anticipate spending approximately $1,225 on environmental costs. These costs will be chargedagainst our environmental liability reserve and will not impact income.    Working Capital   Working capital at March 31, 2012 was $39,805 an increase of $7,429, from $32,376 at March 31, 2011. Excluding increased cash of$6,302, working capital increased by $1,127, or 4.3%, while sales increased by 8.6%. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.4:1.0 at March 31, 2012, compared with 3.1:1.0 at the beginning of fiscal 2012. The working capitalincrease resulted primarily from a $6,302 increase in cash, an $881 increase in accounts receivable, a $1,486 increase in current deferred income taxes and a $2,262 decrease in accounts payable. Partly offsetting these amounts was a $2,464 increasein current portion of long-term debt, and a $937 increase in other current liabilities. There was a $101 net decrease in other working capital items.    Accounts receivable days outstanding were nearly equivalent for both years at 54.6 days at March 31, 2012 and 54.4 days at March 31, 2011. Inventory turnover was also about the same for bothyears at 3.4 turns in fiscal 2012 and 3.3 turns in fiscal 2011. These accounts receivables and inventory velocity measures are based on fiscal fourth quarter averages.       25     Capital Expenditures   Fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 capital expenditures-operations were $727 and $787, respectively. Capitalized relocation expenditures infiscal 2011 were $161, before receiving a $233 build-out credit. The increase is primarily for test equipment for newly-developed products, information technology, and operations.   Fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 capitalized qualification units expenditures were $1,997 and $807, respectively. The increase is due tonewly-developed products nearing the end of development and the start of qualification testing.

See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements contained elsewhere in this report.         (b)  Estimated interest payments on long-term debt reflect the scheduled interest payments of the term loan under the Senior Credit Facility and assume an effective weightedaverage interest rate of 1.5%, our blended interest rate at March 31, 2012.    Our supplier purchase orderscontain provisions allowing vendors to recover certain costs in the event of cancellation for convenience by us. We believe that we do not have significant ongoing purchase obligations with respect to our suppliers that are material inamount or that would result, individually or collectively, in a material loss exposure to us if cancelled for convenience. Furthermore, purchase obligations for capital assets and services historically have not been material in amount.   INFLATION    Neitherinflation nor deflation has had, and we do not expect it to have, a material impact upon operating results. We cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future.       26     CONTINGENCIES    Environmental matters     Environmental matters are discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in thisreport.

The Senior Credit Facility required us to enter into an interest rate swap for atleast three years in an amount not less than 50% of the term loan for the first two years and 35% of the term loan for the third year. An interest rate swap, a type of derivative financial instrument, is used to minimize the effects of interest ratefluctuations on cash flows. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. In September 2008, we entered into a three-year interest rate swap to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments on the term loan as required byour Senior Credit Facility. The swaps net effect of the spread between the floating rate (30 day LIBOR) and the fixed rate (3.25%), was settled monthly, and was reflected as an adjustment to interest expense in the period incurred. Theadjustment to record the swap at its fair value was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. We reduced our existing unrealized loss on the interest rate swap during fiscal 2012. The interest rate swap expired in August 2011.   At March 31, 2012, $10,500 of our Senior Credit Facility was tied to LIBOR, and a 1% increase or decrease in interestrates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $107 based on the debt outstanding under the facility at March 31, 2012.       27     ITEM 8.     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
