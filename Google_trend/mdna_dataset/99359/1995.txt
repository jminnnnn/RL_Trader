ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           The Company's fiscal year ends on March 31.  Accordingly, all references to years in this Management's Discussion refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated year.  Also when referred to herein, operating profit means net sales less operating expenses, without deduction for general corporate expenses, interest and income taxes.  The Consolidated Statement of Operations has been restated with respect to discontinued operations to provide a consistent basis for comparing the performance of the Company's continuing operations for the years presented.           Revenue from continuing operations in 1995 was $102.7 million, an increase of $19.8 million or 24% from 1994, compared with a $18.2 million or 28% increase from 1993 to 1994.  Gross profit in 1995 increased $5.8 million or 23% from 1994, compared with an increase of $5.0 million or 25% from 1993 to 1994.  Operating profit from continuing operations for 1995 was $16.7 million, an increase of $2.9 million or 21% from 1994, compared with an increase of $2.3 million or 20% from 1993 to 1994. Changes in sales, operating profit and new orders from continuing operations are discussed below by segment, and additional information regarding industry segments is contained in Note 12 of the Notes to Financial Statements.           Net income, including discontinued operations, for 1995 was $2.5 million or $.50 per share, compared to $6.9 million or $1.34 per share in 1994. These changes in net income were affected both by operating profit, as discussed in the Business Segment sections below, and by discontinued operations, as discussed in the Discontinued Operations section below.  Net loss from discontinued operations, including disposal losses,  was $4.9 million or $.95 in 1995 and accounted for net income of $1.1 million or $.21 per share in 1994.           In the fourth quarter of 1995 the Company sold primarily all of the assets and business of its chaff products operation and recorded a pre-tax loss of $0.6 million as discussed below in the Discontinued Operations section.  In August, 1994 the Company acquired Industrial Retaining Ring Company as discussed below in the Acquisitions section and the Business Segment section.           In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a reduction of $0.8 million of Federal income tax provisions.  Also in the fourth quarter of 1994 the Company sold its tear gas division and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.7 million as discussed below in the discontinued operations section.  In August, 1993 the Company acquired the Palnut fastener division and the Electrical Specialties Company as discussed below in the Acquisitions section and the Business Segment sections.           In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $3.6 million to provide for estimated future site remediation  costs at two facilities located in Pennsylvania.  Also during 1993, the Company reflected pre-tax charges of $0.8 million for proxy solicitation and related legal expenses associated with the contested election of directors.  The Company accrued or reimbursed the expenses for both slates of directors in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the September 1992 annual meeting of stockholders.  These charges were offset in the fourth quarter of 1993 by the settlement of a contract termination claim for a pre-tax profit of $1.9 million and a fourth quarter reduction of $1.9 million of federal and state income tax provisions.                                             9    11          Fiscal 1993 results were impacted by a pre-tax charge of $0.5 million for the final costs of downsizing the corporate staff and relocating corporate headquarters from California to New Jersey.           Interest expense increased $1.7 million in 1995 primarily as a result of increased bank borrowings used for the acquisition of Industrial Retaining Ring Company, as discussed below in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, and higher interest rates on the Company's debt in fiscal 1995 due to increases in the prime interest rate throughout the year.  Interest expense increased $1.0 million from 1993 to 1994 primarily as a result of increased bank borrowings used for the acquisitions of Palnut and Electrical Specialties Company.           New orders received during 1995 by continuing operations totaled $104.5 million, an increase of $17.1 million or 20% from 1994.  New orders received during 1994 by continuing operations totaled $87.3 million, an increase of $27.6 million or 46% from 1993.  New orders are discussed below by industry segment.  At March 31, 1995, total backlog of unfilled orders was $34.4 million, compared to $30.9 million and $25.8 million at March 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.           During 1994 two new accounting standards were adopted effective April 1, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  106 and No. 109.  Statement No. 106, related to post-retirement benefits other than pensions, resulted in a pre-tax charge to income of $0.4 million in 1994, while Statement No. 109, related to income taxes, had no material effect on 1994 earnings.  The corporation's liquidity and cash flow were not affected by these accounting changes.           In March 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115, related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.  Adoption of this statement resulted in  a gross unrealized holding loss of $1.6 million, reported as a reduction to stockholders' equity in the March 31, 1994 balance sheet.   ACQUISITIONS           Effective August 31, 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Industrial Retaining Ring Company and its affiliated companies for a total purchase price of $14.8 million in cash and the assumption of liabilities.  Industrial Retaining Ring Company manufactures retaining rings and clips used primarily in the heavy equipment and industrial machinery industries.  Sales on an annual basis approximate $9 million.           On July 28, 1993, the Company acquired the assets and business of Electrical Specialties Company for a total purchase price of $1.7 million in cash.  Electrical Specialties Company manufactures electrical cables and wire harnesses for the heavy equipment industry.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 this product line, which is located at the TransTechnology Electronics division, was classified with discontinued operations.           On August 2, 1993, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of the Palnut fastener operation ("Palnut") of TRW Inc. for a total purchase price of $20.5 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities consisting primarily of trade payables and accrued expenses aggregating approximately                                             10    12 $1.4 million.  The Palnut operation manufactures single and multi-thread metal fasteners, for the automotive and industrial products industries.  Sales on an annual basis approximate $29 million.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS           In March 1995, the Company sold substantially all of the assets and business of its chaff products operation for $6.7 million in cash.  The sale of this operation resulted in an after-tax disposal loss of $0.4 million.  The Company retained the chaff avionics product line and negotiated its sale separately in May 1995.  Also, in March 1995, the Company discontinued and is negotiating the sale of its computer graphics service operations which operate under the name TransTechnology Systems & Services, and its Electronics division, which includes Electronic Connections and Assemblies, Inc.  The domestic portion of the computer graphics service operations was sold in June 1995.           In March 1994, the Company sold its Federal Laboratories division for $1.0 million in cash, $1.2 million in notes receivable and 465,000 shares of Mace Security International, Inc. Common stock.  The sale of this division resulted in a after-tax gain of $0.5 million.  Additional after-tax disposal costs of $0.5 million were recorded in 1995 in connection with the sale.           During 1992, the Company adopted a restructuring plan which provided for the sale of its Financial Systems,  Gessner , Lloyd and  Belfort divisions, and the discontinuance of its Computer Graphics manufacturing operation.  At March 31, 1992, the Company had completed the sale of its Financial Systems division, and had classified all of these businesses for financial reporting purposes as discontinued operations.  On May 29, 1992, and June 4, 1992, the Company completed the sales of its  Gessner  and Lloyd divisions, respectively.  The Company received cash of $4.3 million, long term notes of $2.0 million, and a receivable of $0.3 million.  In the fourth quarter of 1995 and 1993, the Company reported an after-tax loss and gain on disposal of these divisions of $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.  These additional costs and income represented adjustments to previous estimates related to litigation matters.  In January 1993, the Company sold its  Belfort division for $1.0 million in cash and a $1.7 million note receivable. After-tax income of $1.0 million and $0.4 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 1994 and 1993, respectively, from this transaction.  Additionally, as part of the sale, the Company consigned $1.3 million of inventory under a five-year contractual purchase agreement of which $0.7 million remained at March 31, 1995.  The Company retained one weather instrument product line and is negotiating its sale separately from the above transaction.  Additional after-tax costs of $0.1 and $0.9 million were recorded in 1994 and 1993, respectively, in connection with the Company's former Computer Graphics manufacturing operation, which was discontinued in August, 1991.  These additional costs were for actual and estimated future discontinuation costs.           Additional after-tax net costs of $0.7 million and $0.7 million were recorded in 1995 and 1993 in connection with the Company's former Space Ordinance Systems division, which was sold in May 1990, and an after-tax gain on disposal of $0.2 million was recorded in 1994.  These additional costs and income represent adjustments to previous estimates related to litigation and environmental matters.           Additional after-tax costs of $0.3 million were recorded in 1995 in connection with other previously discontinued and sold operations.  These additional costs represent adjustments to previous estimates related to environmental matters.                                             11    13 SPECIALTY FASTENER PRODUCTS SEGMENT           1995 COMPARED WITH 1994           Sales for the Specialty Fastener Products segment were $71.1 million in 1995, an increase of $18.8 million or 36% from 1994.  The increase in sales was primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of Palnut fastener operations in  1995 versus eight months in 1994, the inclusion of eight months of Industrial Retaining Ring Company operations in 1995, and increased industrial and truck fastener demand for gear-driven fasteners in fiscal 1995.           Operating profit for the Specialty Fastener Products segment was $16.5 million in 1995, an increase of $6.5 million or 65% from 1994.  The primary factors contributing to the segments increased operating profit in 1995 were the inclusion of eight months of Industrial Retaining Ring Company operations, the inclusion of twelve months of Palnut fastener operations in 1995 versus eight months in 1994 and increased shipments of gear-driven fasteners.           In 1995, new orders in the Specialty Fastener Products segment increased $14.4 million or 24% from 1994.  The primary reasons for the increase were the inclusion of twelve months of Palnut fastener operations in 1995 versus eight months in 1994, the inclusion of eight months of Industrial Retaining Ring Company operations and the increased demand for gear-driven fasteners.  Backlog of unfilled orders was $12.7 million at March 31, 1995, compared to $9.5 million at March 31, 1994.           1994 COMPARED WITH 1993           Sales for the Specialty Fastener Products segment were $52.3 million in 1994, an increase of $23.3 million or 80% from 1993.  The increase in sales was primarily due to the inclusion of eight months of Palnut fastener operations and increased sales of gear-driven fasteners.           Operating profit for the Specialty Fastener Products segment was $10.0 million in 1994, an increase of $4.5 million or 81% from 1993.  The primary factors contributing to the segment's increased operating profit in 1994 were the inclusion of eight months of the Palnut threaded fastener operations and increased shipments of gear-driven fasteners.           In 1994, new orders in the Specialty Fastener Products segment increased $29.7 million or 99% from 1993.  All  product lines experienced increased new orders in 1994 over 1993.  This increase was due primarily to the acquisition of the Palnut product line.  Backlog of unfilled orders was $9.5 million at March 31, 1994, compared to $2.5 million at March 31, 1993.   RESCUE HOIST AND CARGO HOOK PRODUCTS SEGMENT           1995 COMPARED WITH 1994           Sales for the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment were flat in 1995 at $30.0 million.  All three product lines in this segment, rescue hoists and related spare parts, cargo hooks, and tie-downs, experienced virtually identical sales as in 1994.                                             12    14          Operating profit for the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment was $0.2 million in 1995, a decrease of $3.6 million or 96% from 1994.  The decrease was primarily due to reduced margins for all product lines through the first three quarters from shipments on low profit contracts.           In 1995 new orders in the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment increased by $2.7 million or 10% from 1994.  New orders for rescue hoists and related spare parts were up $5.2 million or 27%, new orders for cargo hooks were down $2.8 million or 35%, and new orders for tie-downs were up $0.3 million or 55%, in 1995 over 1994. These changes were primarily due to customer timing of  order placement.  At March 31, 1995, the backlog of unfilled orders was $21.8 million, compared to $21.4 million at March 31, 1994.           Sales related to United States Government contracts, which consist primarily of defense contracts and represent approximately 18% of the Company's total 1995 sales from continuing operations, have been declining in recent years.  While management remains concerned with the continued trend toward reductions in defense spending,  many of the Company's defense related programs, as well as spare parts requirements for these programs, will continue for several years, though there can be no assurances in that regard.  Moreover, the Company is well on its way in implementing a strategy of developing its non-defense businesses through acquisitions and refocused foreign and commercial market attention.           1994 COMPARED WITH 1993           Sales for the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment were $29.6 million in 1994, a decrease of $5.4 million or 16% from 1993.  Fiscal 1994 sales of rescue hoists and related spare parts and tie-downs decreased $8.0 million or 27% from 1993 due primarily to delays in the timing of customers placing new orders in 1994, increased competition resulting in reduced tie-down orders and the settlement of a contract termination claim for a pre-tax profit of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 1993.  Sales of cargo hooks increased $2.6 million or 51% primarily due to timing of customer orders.           Operating profit for the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment was $3.8 million for 1994, a decrease of $2.2 million or 37% from 1993.  The decrease was primarily due to the reduced shipments of rescue hoists and related spare parts, offset by increased cargo hook shipments, as mentioned above.           New orders for the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment decreased in 1994 by $2.1 million or 7%.  Cargo hook new orders increased while rescue hoists and  related spare parts and tie-downs experienced decreased new orders in 1994, primarily due to the timing of customer orders.  At March 31, 1994, the backlog of unfilled orders was $21.4 million, compared to $23.3 million at March 31, 1993.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           The Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 38%, 34% and 17% as of March 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The current ratio at March 31, 1995, stood at 3.25 compared to 3.49 and 3.27 at March 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Working capital was $53.1 million at March 31, 1995, down $0.8 million from March 31, 1994 and up $9.6 million from March 31, 1993.           At March 31, 1995, the Company's debt consisted of $16.3 million of borrowings under a revolving bank credit line, an $8.1 million bank term loan, a $15.0 million bank term loan and $1.0 million of other borrowings.  The revolving bank credit line commitment is $35.0 million and is subject to a borrowing base                                             13    15 formula.  This commitment, which was available to the Company through September 30, 1995, was refinanced on June 30, 1995.  The agreement provides for borrowings and letters of credit based on collateralized accounts receivable and inventory.  All fixed assets other than real property with the exception of certain real property located in Mountainside, New Jersey, are also included as collateral.  Letters of credit, which are included in the borrowing base formula, are limited to $5.0 million. Letters of credit under the line at March 31, 1995 were $1.6 million.  Interest is accrued at the lending bank's prime rate or, at the Company's option, the London Interbank Offered Rate plus two percentage points, which the Company was utilizing for $16.3 million of outstanding borrowings at March 31, 1995.  The agreement contains customary operating and financial covenants typical to this form of financing and further provides that quarterly dividend payments cannot exceed 25% of the Company's cumulative net income in each year.  For the year ended March 31, 1995, the Company was not in compliance with the net income covenant, and paid dividends in excess of 25% of the Company's cumulative net income for the year.  The Company has received waivers of acceptance from the lenders for both these covenant non-compliance issues.  The $8.1 million term loan, which was used to acquire the Palnut fastener operation in August 1993, is with the same lenders as the revolving credit line, is secured by the same collateral, and is due and payable on August 31, 1998.  Principal payments of $360,000 are due and payable on the last day of each quarter through June 30, 1998, with a final balloon payment of $3,040,000 due and payable on August 31, 1998.  Interest accrues at the lending bank's prime rate and is payable monthly. In connection with the Industrial Retaining Ring Company acquisition, in September 1994, the Company obtained a $15.0 million term loan with the same lender as the revolving credit line and secured by the same collateral.  This term loan is due and payable in equal quarterly installments of $937,500 commencing on December 31, 1995.  Interest accrues at the lending bank's prime rate and is payable monthly.  The $8.1 and $15.0 million term loans were also refinanced on June 30, 1995.           On May 13, 1994, the Company obtained authorization from its lender to repurchase up to 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an aggregate price not to exceed $2.5 million.  At March 31, 1995, the Company had repurchased 172,500 shares at an aggregate cost of $2.1 million.           Management believes that the Company's anticipated cash flow from operations, combined with the bank credit described above, will be sufficient to support current and forecasted working capital requirements and dividend payments.  Capital expenditures in 1995 were $5.0 million as compared with $5.0 million in 1994.  The Company's two industry segments have similar cash flow requirements.           The Company is subject to various contingencies related to land and groundwater contamination at several facilities.  These matters are described in Note 10 of the Notes to Financial Statements.  Management believes that, after taking into consideration information provided by counsel, the resolution of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company's liquidity.           On June 30, 1995 the Company acquired the Seeger Group of companies from a unit of AB SKF of Gothenburg, Sweden for approximately $43,000,000 plus the assumption of trade debts and accrued expenses.  The Seeger Group, headquartered in Konigstein, Germany, is the global leader in manufacturing circlips, snap rings and retaining rings.  In 1994 the Group's consolidated revenues from its manufacturing operations in Germany, the UK, Brazil and U.S.A. were approximately $73.0 million with an operating income of $4.4 million.  The Seeger Group operates under the trade names of "Seeger", "Anderton", and "Waldes" with over 900 employees at its five manufacturing facilities.  Financing for the transaction was provided through a new $115,000,000 credit facility provided by a bank.            The credit facility, structured as a $25,000,000, 7 year term loan, a $50,000,000, 4-1/2 year term loan, a $34,000,000 revolving crecdit facility, and $6,000,000 of international lines of credit, is secured by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Interest rates are tied to either Prime or LIBOR with a margin depending upon the Company's achievement of certain operating and financial goals.  The facility limits the Company's ability to pay dividends to 25% of net income and restricts capital expenditures to $6,500,000 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1996, and $7,000,000 thereafter for the life of the loan, as well as containing other customary financial covenants.            Proceeds from the new credit facility were also used to retire the Company's existing bank debt.                                            14    16 ITEM 8.
