ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           The Company's fiscal year ends on March 31.  Accordingly, all references to years in this Management's Discussion refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated year.  Also when referred to herein, operating profit means net sales less operating expenses, without deduction for general corporate expenses, interest and income taxes.  The Consolidated Statement of Operations has been restated with respect to discontinued operations to provide a consistent basis for comparing the performance of the Company's continuing operations for the years presented.  As a result of the sale of the Financial Systems division and the discontinuance of the Computer Graphics manufacturing operation in 1992, the Advanced Technology Products segment has been eliminated as a reporting segment.                                             10    12          Revenue from continuing operations in 1994 was $121.5 million, an increase of $24.8 million or 26% from 1993, compared with a $5.9 million or 6% increase from 1992 to 1993.  Gross profit in 1994 increased $6.7 million or 23% from 1993, compared with an increase of $9.0 million or 44% from 1992 to 1993. Operating profit from continuing operations for 1994 was $17.3 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 9% from 1993, compared with an increase of $8.9 million or 127% from 1992 to 1993. Changes in sales, operating profit and new orders from continuing operations are discussed below by segment, and additional information regarding industry segments is contained in Note 11 of the Notes to Financial Statements.           Net income, including discontinued operations, for 1994 was $6.9 million or $1.34 per share, compared to $5.1 million or $1.01 per share in 1993.  These changes in net income were primarily affected by operating profit, as discussed in the Business Segment sections below.  Discontinued operations, including the gain on disposal which is discussed in more detail below, were essentially break-even in 1994 and accounted for net losses of $0.1 million or $.01 per share in 1993.           Revenue from continuing operations for the quarter ended March 31, 1994 was $34.8 million, an increase of $7.5 million or 27% from the comparable period in 1993.           In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a reduction of $0.8 million of Federal income tax provisions.  Also in the fourth quarter of 1994 the Company sold its tear gas division and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.7 million as discussed below in the discontinued operations section.  In August, 1993 the Company acquired the Palnut fastener division and the Electrical Specialties Company as discussed below in the Acquisitions section and the Business Segment sections.           In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $3.6 million to provide for estimated future site remediation costs at two facilities located in Pennsylvania.  Also during 1993, the Company reflected pre-tax charges of $0.8 million for proxy solicitation and related legal expenses associated with the contested election of directors.  The Company accrued or reimbursed the expenses for both slates of directors in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the September 1992 annual meeting of stockholders.  These charges were offset in the fourth quarter of 1993 by the settlement of a contract termination claim for a pre-tax profit of $1.9 million and a fourth quarter reduction of $1.9 million of federal and state income tax provisions.           Interest expense increased $0.9 million in 1994 primarily as a result of increased bank borrowings used for the acquisitions of Palnut and Electrical Specialties Company, as discussed below in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.  Interest expense decreased $1.5 million from 1992 to 1993 primarily as a result of the Company using the proceeds from the sale of its Financial Systems, Gessner, Lloyd and Belfort divisions to reduce long-term debt.           Fiscal 1993 and 1992 results were impacted by a pre-tax charge of $0.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for the costs of downsizing the corporate staff and relocating corporate headquarters from California to New Jersey.           New orders received during 1994 by continuing operations totaled $125.6 million, an increase of $43.4 million or 53% from 1993.  New orders received during 1993 by continuing operations totaled $82.2 million, a decrease of $9.7 million or 11% from 1992.  New orders are discussed below by industry                                             11    13 segment.  At March 31, 1994, total backlog of unfilled orders was $45.2 million, compared to $40.7 million at March 31, 1993, and $54.6 million at March 31, 1992.           During 1994 two new accounting standards were adopted effective April 1, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  106 and No. 109.  Statement No. 106, related to post-retirement benefits other than pensions, resulted in an after-tax charge to income of $0.1 million while Statement No. 109, related to income taxes, had no material effect on 1994 earnings.  The corporation's liquidity and cash flow were not affected by these accounting changes.           In March 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115, related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.  Adoption of this standard resulted in a March 31, 1994 balance sheet reduction of $1.6 million to other assets and stockholders equity.           ACQUISITIONS           On July 28, 1993, the Company acquired the assets and business of Electrical Specialties Company for a total purchase price of $1.7 million in cash.  Electrical Specialties Company manufactures electrical cables and wire harnesses for the heavy equipment industry.           On August 2, 1993, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of the Palnut fastener operation ("Palnut") of TRW Inc. for a total purchase price of $20.5 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities consisting primarily of trade payables and accrued expenses aggregating approximately $1.4 million.  The Palnut operation manufactures single and multi-thread metal fasteners for the automotive and industrial products industries.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS           During 1992, the Company adopted a restructuring plan which provided for the sale of its Financial Systems, Gessner, Lloyd and Belfort divisions, and the discontinuation of its Computer Graphics manufacturing operation.  At March 31, 1992, these businesses were classified for financial reporting purposes as discontinued operations.           On March 30, 1992, the Company completed the sale of its Financial Systems division to Recognition Equipment Incorporated for total consideration of $37.8 million, consisting of a note receivable of $2.5 million and $35.3 million in cash, of which $5.1 million was placed in escrow pending the resolution of certain issues as specified in the purchase agreement.  This transaction resulted in an after-tax gain of $0.7 million.  At March 31, 1994, $2.1 million remained in escrow.           On May 29, 1992, and June 4, 1992, the Company completed the sales of its Gessner and Lloyd divisions, respectively.  The Company received cash of $4.3 million, long term notes of $2 million, and a receivable of $0.3 million. These sales resulted in a combined after-tax loss of $1.6 million reflected in the March 31, 1992 financial statements.  In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company reported a gain on disposal of these divisions of $0.4 million (net of applicable income tax provision of $0.1 million).           On January 24, 1993, the Company sold its Belfort division.  The Company received cash of $1.0 million and a long term note of $1.7 million. After-tax income of $0.1 million and $0.4 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 1994 and 1993, respectively, from this transaction.  Additionally, as part of the sale, the Company consigned $1.3 million of inventory under a five-year contractual purchase                                             12    14 agreement of which $0.8 million remained at March 31, 1994.  The Company retained one weather instrument product line and is negotiating its sale separately from the above transaction.           In August 1991, the Company discontinued its Computer Graphics manufacturing operation.  Such operation was reclassified as a discontinued operation, and an after-tax loss from the discontinuation of $4.1 million is reflected in the Company's 1992 statement of operations.  In 1994 and 1993 the Company recognized another $0.1 and $0.9 million, respectively, for additional after- tax actual and estimated future discontinuation costs.  The Computer Graphics manufacturing operation incurred an after-tax operating loss of $1.2 million in 1992.           Additional costs of $0.7 million, after-tax, were recorded in 1993 in connection with the Company's Space Ordnance Systems division, which was sold in May 1990, and a gain on disposal of $0.2 million, after tax, was recorded in 1994.  These additional costs and income represent adjustments to previous estimates related to litigation and environmental matters.           In March 1994, the Company sold its Federal Laboratories division for $1.0 million in cash, $1.2 million in notes receivable and 465,000 shares of Mace Security International, Inc. common stock.  The sale of this division resulted in a gain of $0.5 million (net of applicable income tax provision of $0.2 million).  INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS SEGMENT           1994 COMPARED WITH 1993           Sales for the Industrial Products segment were $66.4 million in 1994, an increase of $29.5 million or 80% from 1993.  The increase in sales was primarily due to the inclusion of eight months of Palnut fastener operations and increased sales of gear- driven fasteners.  The total 1994 increase in specialty fastener sales was $23.4 million.  Additionally, the increase included eight months of electrical harness operations which amounted to $5 million in sales.  TransTechnology Systems & Services sales increased $1.1 million or 15% in 1994 primarily due to increased domestic and overseas demand for workstations and small financial systems as well as increased maintenance contract sales.           Operating profit for the Industrial Products segment was $9.2 million in 1994, an increase of $1.8 million or 25% from 1993.  The primary factors contributing to the segment's increased operating profit in 1994 were the inclusion of eight months of the Palnut threaded fastener operations and increased shipments of gear-driven fasteners which were partially offset by reduced operating profit at TransTechnology Systems & Services due to costs associated with the introduction of two new small financial systems products which were subsequently cancelled in the fourth quarter of 1994.  Other contributing factors which offset the overall increase in operating profit were shipments on low margin contracts from the newly acquired electrical harness product line and losses attendant to the start-up of Electrical Connections and Assemblies, Inc.'s business.           In 1994, new orders in the industrial products segment increased $38.6 million or 105% from 1993.  All industrial product lines experienced increased new orders in 1994 over 1993.  The specialty fastener product line and electrical harness product line contributed $29.7 million and $7.4 million of increased new orders in 1994, respectively.  In 1994, TransTechnology Systems & Services new orders were up 22% over 1993.  The specialty fastener increase was due primarily to the acquisition of the Palnut product line.  The new order increase at TransTechnology Systems & Services was primarily due to increased penetration of                                             13    15 third party maintenance markets.  Backlog of unfilled orders was $15.2 million at March 31, 1994, compared to $6.8 million at March 31, 1993.           1993 COMPARED WITH 1992           Sales for the Industrial Products segment were $37 million in 1993, an increase of $1.6 million or 5% from 1992.  The increase in sales was primarily related to the increased sales volume of specialty fasteners which was up in 1993 by $2.3 million, an increase of 8% from 1992, as a result of new product market penetration and increased industrial and truck fastener demand. TransTechnology Systems & Services sales decreased $0.6 million in 1993 primarily due to reduced overseas demand for workstations and small financial systems, partially offset by an increase in domestic maintenance contract sales.           Operating profit for the Industrial Products segment was $7.3 million in 1993, up $0.3 million or 5% from 1992, resulting primarily from increased sales and margins related to specialty fasteners and domestic maintenance contracts, and partially offset by the decreased sales and margins related to overseas workstations and small financial systems.           In 1993, new orders in the Industrial Products segment increased $1.9 million or 5% from 1992. Orders for specialty fasteners increased in 1993 by $2.6 million or 9% due to increased market share. TransTechnology Systems & Services new orders were down $0.7 million or 10% mainly due to reduced demand for workstations and small financial systems.  Backlog of unfilled orders was $6.8 million at March 31, 1993, compared to $7.1 million at March 31, 1992.   AEROSPACE PRODUCTS SEGMENT           1994 COMPARED WITH 1993           Sales for the Aerospace Products segment were $54.1 million in 1994, a decrease of $4.9 million or 8% from 1993.  Fiscal 1994 sales of hoists and winches, related spare parts and tie-downs decreased $8 million or 27% from 1993 due primarily to delays in the timing of customers placing new orders in 1994, increased competition resulting in reduced tie-down orders and the settlement of a contract termination claim for a pre-tax profit of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 1993.  Sales of cargo hooks increased $2.6 million or 51% primarily due to timing of customer orders.  Chaff product sales were down in 1994 by $0.4 million or 4%.  The Company's primary customer for chaff product is the United States Department of Defense and its prime contractors. Due to reduced government defense spending and the fact that customers have adequate quantities of chaff products in inventory, domestic sales are likely to continue at reduced levels.  Sales of electrical cable and conduit in 1994 were up $1.6 million or 16% primarily due to increased shipments on the F-16 fighter and other military programs.  Electrical connector sales decreased in 1994 by $0.7 million or 21% due to a general decrease in demand by commercial airline customers.           Operating profit for the Aerospace Products segment was $8.1 million for 1994, a decrease of $0.4 million or 5% from 1993.  The decrease was primarily due to the reduced shipments of hoist and winches, related spare parts, tie-downs, and electrical connectors, offset by increased cargo hook and electrical cable and conduit shipments, as mentioned above.                                             14    16          New orders for the Aerospace Products segment increased in 1994 by $4.8 million or 11%.  All product lines, with the exception of hoists and winches, related spare parts and tie-downs experienced increased new orders in 1994, primarily due to the timing of customer orders.           The Aerospace Products segment backlog varies substantially from time to time due to the size and timing of orders.  At March 31, 1994, the backlog of unfilled orders was $30 million, compared to $34 million at March 31, 1993.           Sales related to United States Government contracts, which consist primarily of defense contracts and represent approximately 20% of the Company's total 1994 sales, have been declining in recent years.  Management remains concerned with the continued trend toward reductions in defense spending by the United States government.  However, many of the Company's programs, as well as spare parts requirements for these programs, are expected to continue for several years, and the Company continues to pursue and is currently implementing its strategy of developing its non-defense businesses through acquisitions and refocused foreign and commercial market attention.           1993 COMPARED WITH 1992           Sales for the Aerospace Products segment were $59 million in 1993, an increase of $4.0 million or 7% from 1992.  Fiscal 1993 sales of hoists and winches, related spare parts and tie-downs increased $6.4 million or 27% from 1992 due primarily to improved manufacturing capability.  Sales of cargo hooks decreased $1.2 million or 19% from 1992.  As a result of the resolution of manufacturing problems in 1992, the Company was able to significantly reduce a large amount of accumulated overdue backlog by the end of fiscal 1992.  This reduction in backlog resulted in unusually high sales volume of primarily cargo hooks in the prior year.  This increase was partially offset in 1993 by the product line acquisition from Kinedyne which added $0.3 million of cargo hook sales.  Chaff product sales were down in 1993 by $2.9 million or 22%, due to reduced government defense spending and the fact that adequate quantities of the product were in customer inventories.  Sales of electrical cable and conduit in 1993 were up by $1.8 million or 20% primarily due to increased shipments on the F-16 jet fighter program which had been delayed in 1992. Electrical connector sales decreased in 1993 by $0.3 million or 9% due to a general decrease in commercial airline orders.           Operating profit for the Aerospace Products segment was $8.5 million for 1993, compared to a break-even in the prior year.  Primary factors contributing to the segment's increased operating profit were increased domestic and foreign shipments of hoists, winches, related spare parts, electrical cable and conduit, and improved manufacturing systems and efficiencies in cargo hooks, hoists and winches, related spare parts and electrical cable, conduit and connector products.           New orders for the Aerospace Products segment decreased in 1993 by $13.1 million or 22% from 1992.  New orders for hoists and winches and related spare parts decreased in 1993 by $2.9 million or 12%.  This fluctuation was primarily a result of the timing of receipt of new contracts rather than a trend related to demand for these products.  Chaff product and electrical cable and connector orders were down by $14.4 million or 58%.  Chaff product new orders were down $5.6 million or 50% from 1992 primarily due to reduced government defense spending and adequate quantities of the product in customer inventories, as described above.  Electrical cable and connector orders decreased $8.8 million or 64% primarily as a result of delays in new orders from the military and aerospace industries and general slowdown in department of defense purchases, a trend that is likely to continue.  New orders for cargo hooks, tie-downs                                             15    17 and electrical conduit increased by $4.1 million or 42% primarily due to the acquisition of a new product line, receipt of a multi- year order for the CH-53 Helicopter program and increased market share.           At March 31, 1993, the backlog of unfilled orders was $34 million, compared to $47 million at March 31, 1992.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           The Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 34% as of March 31, 1994, 17% as of March 31, 1993 and 15% as of March 31, 1992.  The current ratio at March 31, 1994, stood at 3.49 compared to 3.27 at March 31, 1993 and 1.94 at March 31, 1992.  Working Capital was $53.8 million at March 31, 1994, up $10.4 million from March 31, 1993 and $18.1 million from March 31, 1992.           At March 31, 1994, the Company's debt consisted of $25 million of borrowings under a revolving bank credit line, a $9.2 million bank term loan and $0.5 million of other borrowings.  In connection with the Palnut acquisition, the Company amended its revolving bank credit line on July 29, 1993 to increase the bank's lending commitment from $25 million to $35 million. This commitment will be available to the Company through September 30, 1995, and is subject to a borrowing base formula.  The agreement provides for borrowings and letters of credit based on collateralized accounts receivable and inventory.  All fixed assets other than real property with the exception of certain real property located in Mountainside, New Jersey, are also included as collateral.  Letters of credit, which are included in the borrowing base formula, are limited to $5 million.  Letters of credit under the line at March 31, 1994 were $1.6 million.  Interest is accrued at the lending bank's prime rate or, at the Company's option, the London Interbank Offered Rate plus two percentage points, which the Company was utilizing for $25 million of outstanding borrowings at March 31, 1994.  The agreement contains customary operating and financial covenants typical to this form of financing and further provides that quarterly dividend payments cannot exceed 25% of the Company's cumulative net income in each year.  The $9.2 million term loan is with the same lenders as the revolving credit line, is secured by the same collateral, and is due and payable on August 31, 1998.  The first principal payment of $120,000 was due and paid on September 30, 1993.  Thereafter, principal payments of $360,000 are due and payable on the last day of each quarter through June 30, 1998, with a final balloon payment of $3,040,000 due and payable on August 31, 1998.  Interest accrues at the lending bank's prime rate plus 1/4 percentage points, but in accordance with the loan agreement will be reduced to the prime rate for fiscal 1995 because the Company exceeded $6.0 million in net income for fiscal year 1994.  Interest is payable monthly.           On May 13, 1994, the Company obtained authorization from its lender to repurchase up to 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an aggregate price not to exceed $2.5 million.  At June 16, 1994, the Company had repurchased 50,000 shares.           Management believes that the Company's anticipated cash flow from operations, combined with the bank credit described above, will be sufficient to support current and forecasted working capital requirements and dividend payments.  Capital expenditures in 1994 were $5 million as compared with $5.5 million in 1993.  The Company's two industry segments have similar cash flow requirements.
