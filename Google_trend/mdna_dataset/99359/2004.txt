ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS        Certain statements in this Annual Report constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Acts"). Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact are deemed to be forward-looking statements.        The forward-looking statements in this Annual Report are based on current beliefs, estimates and assumptions concerning the operations, future results and prospects of the Company. As actual operations and results may materially differ from those assumed in forward-looking statements, there is no assurance that forward-looking statements will proved to be accurate. Forward-looking statements are subject to the safe harbors created in the Acts.        Any number of factors could affect future operations and results, including, without limitation, the results of audits and inquiries into the Company's business practices; the Company's ability to complete the refinancing of its Senior and Subordinated Credit Facilities on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company; the Company's ability to be profitable with a smaller and less diverse base of operations that will generate less revenue; the Company's ability to satisfy the listing requirements of the NYSE or any other national exchange on which its shares are or will be listed or otherwise provide a trading venue for its shares; the value of replacement operations, if any; determination by the Company to dispose of additional existing assets; general industry and economic conditions; events impacting the U.S. and world financial markets and economies; interest rate trends; capital requirements; competition from other companies, changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations affecting the Company in the locations in which it conducts its business; the availability of equity and/or debt financing in the amounts and on the terms necessary to support the Company's future business and those specific risks that are discussed in this Annual Report.                                         6         The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.  GENERAL        We design, develop and manufacture sophisticated lifting equipment for specialty aerospace and defense applications. With over 50% of the global market, we have long been recognized as the world's largest designer and leading supplier of performance-critical rescue hoists and cargo-hook systems. We also manufacture weapons-handling systems, cargo winches, tie-down equipment and tow-hook assemblies. Marketed under the trade name "Breeze-Eastern", our products are designed to be efficient and reliable in extreme operating conditions. Our equipment is used to complete rescue operations and military insertion/extraction operations, move and transport cargo, and load weapons onto aircraft and ground-based launching systems.        Beginning in fiscal 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan to focus our resources and capital on our aerospace and defense products business and exit the specialty fastener segment. On February 24, 2003, we completed the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of our subsidiary, Norco, Inc., to Marathon Power Technologies Company, a division of TransDigm Inc., for cash consideration of $51.0 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. This transaction completed our divestiture program. As a result, our discontinued operations for fiscal 2003 and 2002 include Norco, Inc. and all of the operations related to our Specialty Fastener segment, including the TransTechnology Engineered Rings retaining rings businesses, Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers Corp. and TCR Corporation. Of the operations included in discontinued operations prior to fiscal 2003, only the operations of TransTechnology Engineered Rings USA, Inc., TransTechnology (GB) Limited, TransTechnology Brasil Ltda., Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers Corporation, TCR Corporation and Norco, Inc. were carried into fiscal 2003.        All discussions related to our ongoing operations, or to TransTechnology Corporation, which include our results of operations, refer only to continuing operations, which consists of our Breeze-Eastern business. We discuss our discontinued operations separately under the heading " -- Divestitures and Discontinued Operations."        All references to years in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated year unless otherwise specified.        As previously reported, we are subject to an investigation being conducted by the Newark, New Jersey office of the United States Attorney with respect to Breeze-Eastern's overhaul and repair operations. We have, to date, cooperated fully and will continue to cooperate fully with the government's investigation. In addition, the Board of Directors retained a fact finding and forensic accounting firm, The Bradlau Group of Morristown, New Jersey, to perform an independent review of the overhaul and repair operations of our Breeze-Eastern business. The Board of Directors has shared the preliminary and follow-on reports of the findings of this independent review with the United States Attorney's office. The investigation has had no impact, and we do not expect an impact, on our ability to manufacture and ship products and meet customer delivery schedules. As of this date, the United States Attorney's investigation is continuing and we have not been made aware of any specific statutory or regulatory violations resulting from that investigation.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue at the later of 1) when products are shipped to customers or 2) when title passes to customers.        Inventory. We purchase materials to manufacture components for use in our products and for use by our engineering, repair and overhaul business. Our decision to purchase a set quantity of a particular item is influenced by several factors including current and projected cost, future estimated availability, lead time for production of the materials, existing and projected contracts to produce certain items and the estimated needs for our repair and overhaul business.        We value our inventories using the lower of cost or market on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. We reduce the carrying amount of these inventories to net realizable value based on our assessment of inventory that is considered excess or obsolete using a formula based on firm sales orders and historical usage. Since all of our products are produced to meet firm sales orders, our focus for reserves is on the purchased and manufactured parts.        Environmental Reserves. We provide for environmental reserves when, after consultation with our internal and external counsel and other environmental consultants, we determine that a liability is both probable and estimable. In many cases, we do not fix or cap the liability for a particular site when we first record it. Factors that affect the recorded amount of the liability in future years include our participation percentage due to a settlement by, or bankruptcy of, other potentially responsible parties, a change in the environmental laws requiring more stringent requirements, a change in the estimate of future costs that will be incurred to remediate the site, changes in technology related to environmental remediation and appropriate discount factors to reflect the net present value of expected expenditures.                                         7         We discuss current estimated exposure to environmental claims under the caption " -- Environmental Matters."        Financial Derivatives. Until July 5, 2002, we had outstanding interest rate swaps in association with our prior senior credit agreement. We valued these swaps using estimates based on then-prevailing interest rates and the amount we were required to pay was impacted significantly by changes in interest rates. We no longer hold any such agreements. Additionally, we were required to treat our outstanding warrants as financial derivatives and mark these securities to market at the end of each accounting period, resulting in the recognition of a gain or loss in each period. This mark-to-market requirement terminated at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004 as the put feature causing the warrants to be treated as derivatives expired during that period.        Deferred Tax Assets. This asset, for which no valuation allowance was needed, represents income tax benefits expected to be realized in the future, primarily as a result of the use of net operating loss carry-forwards. Because we expect to generate adequate amounts of taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax loss carry-forwards in 2006 through 2024, no valuation allowance is considered necessary. If we do not generate adequate taxable earnings, some or all of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. Additionally, changes to the federal and state income tax laws also could impact our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards. The State of New Jersey, in response to a budget crisis, has suspended through fiscal 2004 the ability of a corporation to use a net operating loss carryforward against taxable income earned in the state. As a result, we are required to pay New Jersey income taxes (if any) for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 in spite of losses being carried forward. It is possible that the State of New Jersey could extend the suspension.        Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets (excluding financial instruments and deferred tax assets) and certain identifiable intangibles with finite useful lives to be held and used are reviewed by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant physical change in an asset, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If a review for recoverability is necessary, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. In performing these estimates, we group our assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows (including divestitures of certain businesses in prior years). If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Any impairment loss recognized is measured as the excess of carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003        Net sales. Our sales increased to $64.6 million for fiscal 2004, a 17% increase over sales of $55.0 million for fiscal 2003. This increase in sales is the result of higher shipments of rescue hoists and cargo hooks for military and civil rescue agencies and shipments of our HLU-196 Bomb Hoist to the U.S. Navy. The HLU-196 Bomb Hoist is a newly developed product for which we were under contract to the U.S. Navy to deliver approximately 550 units with 13 units remaining which will be shipped in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.        Gross profit. Gross profit increased 14% to $28.1 million for fiscal 2004 from $24.6 million for fiscal 2003. Generally, repair and overhaul services and spare parts sales have higher gross margins than sales of new equipment or engineering services. Notwithstanding improved gross margins realized in fiscal 2004 for new equipment versus 2003, the change in product mix to one that was more heavily weighted in favor of new equipment led to a decrease in gross margin to 43.5% in fiscal 2004 from 44.7% in fiscal 2003. Generally, we cannot predict changes in our product mix between aftermarket sales and new equipment sales for any given period because the changes result primarily from the timing of our customers' orders, over which we have little control.        General, administrative and selling expenses. General, administrative and selling expenses decreased 8% to $16.2 million in fiscal 2004 from $17.6 million in fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily due to lower corporate office expenses resulting from the completion of the restructuring of the corporate office that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. This decrease was offset partially by approximately $1.0 million of legal and other costs associated with the ongoing investigation by the Newark, New Jersey office of the United States Attorney of our overhaul and repair operations        Operating income. Operating income (gross profit less general, administrative and selling expenses) increased 71% to $11.9 million in fiscal 2004 from $7.0 million in fiscal 2003. This increase mainly was due to higher sales volume, the benefit of spreading fixed costs over a larger sales volume and the reduction in corporate office expenses.        Interest expense. Interest expense increased $1.2 million to $10.4 million in fiscal 2004 from $9.2 million in fiscal 2003 as a result of the allocation formula we used to apportion interest expense between continuing and discontinued operations in fiscal 2003. We based this allocation formula for fiscal 2003 upon the net asset balances attributable to continuing and discontinued operations. Total                                         8   interest expense for fiscal 2004 decreased $5.0 million to $10.4 million from $15.4 million for fiscal 2003 due to the retirement of debt with the proceeds from divestitures and other internally generated sources of cash.        Interest and other income. In fiscal 2004 we recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.9 million relating to the sale of our remaining 19% interest in Cirteq, Ltd. and the collection of a note from Cirteq, Ltd. There was no such transaction in fiscal 2003.        Forbearance fees. During fiscal 2004, we incurred no expense for forbearance fees versus the $0.8 million we paid in fiscal 2003 to our lenders under our prior senior credit agreement in exchange for their agreement not to pursue any actions against us for violating certain financial covenants. The elimination of this expense was the result of the refinancing of our prior senior credit agreement in August 2002, which cured all defaults and ended the forbearance agreements.        Corporate office restructuring charge. In fiscal 2003 we recognized a $2.7 million charge associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of several positions and restructuring in our corporate office, all of which was paid in fiscal 2003 and 2004. There was no such charge in fiscal 2004.        Unrealized gain on warrants. As we discuss in Note 7 to the financial statements included in this report, the warrants associated with our senior subordinated notes due 2006 were deemed to be derivative financial instruments for purposes of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles at the end of fiscal 2003. As required by those principles, changes in the value of our share price between August 7, 2002 and the end of fiscal 2003 resulted in our recognizing a noncash, non-taxable gain of $2.0 million during fiscal 2003. We recognized no similar gain or loss in fiscal 2004.        Net income. We earned net income of $1.7 million in fiscal 2004, versus net income of $9.2 million (including a gain from discontinued operations of $13.1 million - see "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations") in fiscal 2003, which primarily resulted from the reasons discussed above.        New orders. New orders received in fiscal 2004 totaled $59.4 million, which represents a 12% decrease from new orders of $67.3 million in fiscal 2003. The rescue hoist and cargo winch product line was particularly strong in fiscal 2003 and accounted for virtually all of the decrease in fiscal 2004. Increases in orders for cargo hooks and overhaul and repair were offset by decreases in spares orders and engineering. Generally, new equipment sales are the subject of high-value, long-term contracts, while repair, overhaul and spare parts sales have much shorter lead times and a less predictable order pattern.        Backlog. Backlog at March 31, 2004 was $41.0 million, down $5.2 million from $46.2 million at March 31, 2003. The decrease in the backlog is primarily attributable to shipments of the HLU-196 Bomb Hoist for the U. S. Navy mentioned above. We measure backlog by the amount of products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us as of a given date. Our book to bill ratio for fiscal 2004 was 0.92, compared to 1.22 for fiscal 2003. Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions of product quantities in existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog. Therefore, our backlog may not represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.        Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002        Net sales. Our sales increased to $55.0 million for fiscal 2003, a 15% increase over sales of $47.8 million for fiscal 2002. This increase in sales was the result of higher shipments of cargo hooks and weapons handling equipment for military and civil agencies, as well as increases in sales of spare parts, repair and overhaul of equipment already in the field and the initial shipments of our HLU-196 Bomb Hoist to the U.S. Navy. The HLU-196 Bomb Hoist is a newly developed product for which we are under contract to the U.S. Navy to deliver approximately 550 units through fiscal 2004.        Gross profit. Gross profit increased 18% to $24.6 million for fiscal 2003 from $20.9 million for fiscal 2002. Generally, repair and overhaul services and spare parts sales have higher gross margins than sales of new equipment or engineering services. As a result of a sales mix that was more heavily weighted in favor of aftermarket sales due to the timing of customer orders, we recorded slightly higher gross margins for fiscal 2003. These improvements in product mix, combined with fixed-cost absorption on a generally higher sales volume led to an increase in gross margin to 44.7% in fiscal 2003 from 43.7% in fiscal 2002. These margin improvements from product mix, however, were partially offset by lower than normal gross margins on the HLU-196 Bomb Hoist, a product that was shipped for the first time during the third quarter of fiscal 2003. While the gross margins recognized on the initial shipments of the HLU-196 were lower than historical gross margins, they were higher than the budgeted gross margins due to the realization of manufacturing efficiencies not originally expected in the initial production lots. As a result of the lower gross margins experienced on the HLU-196, we expect future gross margins to be lower than those historically reported. Generally, we cannot predict changes in our product mix between aftermarket sales and new equipment sales for any given period because the changes result primarily from the timing of our customers' orders, over which we have little control.        General, administrative and selling expenses. General, administrative and selling expenses increased 4.7% to $17.6 million in fiscal 2003 from $16.8 million in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to higher general, administrative and selling expenses due to our higher sales volume and a significant increase in the cost of aircraft product liability insurance, the write-off of $0.7 million                                         9   of costs associated with our efforts to restructure the balance sheet, and a provision of $0.4 million associated with a product liability claim from a business sold several years ago offset by $1.2 million on a 14% reduction in corporate office expense. The decrease in corporate office expenses during fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the restructuring of the corporate office that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.        Operating income. Operating income increased 71% to $7.0 million in fiscal 2003 from $4.1 million in fiscal 2002. This increase mainly was due to a more favorable mix of repair, overhaul and spare parts business, a higher sales volume, the benefit of spreading fixed costs over a larger sales volume and the reduction in corporate office expenses.        Interest expense. Interest expense increased $4.2 million to $9.2 million in fiscal 2003 from $4.9 million in fiscal 2002 as a result of the allocation formula we use to apportion interest expense between continuing and discontinued operations. We base this allocation formula upon the net asset balances attributable to continuing and discontinued operations. Total interest expense for fiscal 2003 decreased $9.6 million to $15.4 million from $25.1 million for fiscal 2002 due to the retirement of debt with the proceeds from divestitures and other internally generated sources of cash. Assets held for sale also were reduced substantially, however, causing a higher percentage of assets to be allocated to continuing operations in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002, which resulted in an increased allocation of interest expense to continuing operations in fiscal 2003. The sale of our Norco subsidiary in February 2003 completed our divestiture program and, accordingly, all interest expense is now charged to continuing operations.        Interest and other income. In March 2002, we sold excess real estate and recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.3 million. There was no such transaction in fiscal 2003.        Forbearance fees. During fiscal 2003, we incurred an expense of $0.8 million for forbearance fees we paid to our lenders under our prior senior credit agreement in exchange for their agreement not to pursue any actions against us for violating certain financial covenants. In fiscal 2002, we incurred $2.7 million of such expenses. The reduction in these expenses was the result of lower overall levels of debt during the current fiscal year and the refinancing of our prior senior credit agreement in August 2002, which cured all defaults and ended the forbearance agreements.        Corporate office restructuring charge. In fiscal 2003 we recognized a $2.7 million charge associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of several positions and restructuring in our corporate office, 90% of which was paid by the end of the first quarter of 2004. In fiscal 2002, we recognized a $1.6 million charge associated with the restructuring of our corporate office, related primarily to severance costs following the elimination of several positions, all of which amounts have been paid.        Unrealized gain on warrants. As we discuss in Note 7 to the financial statements included in this report, the warrants associated with our senior subordinated notes due 2006 were deemed to be derivative financial instruments for purposes of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in fiscal 2003. As required by those principles, changes in the value of our share price between August 7, 2002 and the end of fiscal 2003 resulted in our recognizing a noncash, non-taxable gain of $2.0 million during fiscal 2003. We recognized no similar gain or loss in fiscal 2002. As the put feature of the warrants expired during the first quarter of fiscal 2004, no future gains or losses on the warrants were recognized.        Net income. We earned net income of $9.2 million in fiscal 2003, versus a loss of $71.8 million in fiscal 2002, which primarily resulted from the reasons discussed above.        New orders. New orders received in fiscal 2003 totaled $67.3 million, which represents a 28% increase from new orders of $52.4 million in fiscal 2002. The rescue hoist and cargo winch product line was particularly strong, accounting for $14.3 million of the increase. We derived a significant portion of fiscal 2003 orders from long-term contracts. Generally, new equipment sales are the subject of high-value, long-term contracts, while repair, overhaul and spare parts sales have much shorter lead times and a less predictable order pattern.        Backlog. Backlog at March 31, 2003 was $46.2 million, up $12.4 million from $33.8 million at March 31, 2002. We measure backlog by the amount of products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us as of a given date. Our book to bill ratio for fiscal 2003 was 1.22, compared to 1.10 for fiscal 2002. Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions of product quantities in existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog. Therefore, our backlog may not represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.        Liquidity and Capital Resources        Our liquidity requirements depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the timing of production under our long-term contracts with the U.S. Government. Although we have infrequently received payments on these government contracts based on performance milestones, as is the case with our contract with the U.S. Navy for the HLU-196 Bomb Hoist, our working capital needs fluctuate between periods as a result of changes in program status and the timing of payments by program. Additionally, as our sales are generally made on the basis of individual purchase orders, our liquidity requirements vary based on the timing and volume of these orders.                                         10         Our restructuring and divestiture program has had a substantial impact upon our financial condition through March 31, 2004, as we reduced debt with the proceeds from the divestitures and lowered costs as a result of the corporate office restructuring. At March 31, 2004 and 2003, there was no indebtedness outstanding under our New Senior Credit Facility. The loan agreements prohibit the payment of dividends.        As previously reported, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has notified us that the Company has fallen below the NYSE continued listing standards requiring total market capitalization of not less than $50 million over a 30-day trading period and total stockholders' equity of not less than $50 million. We have submitted to the NYSE a plan to comply with the listing standards, which was accepted by the NYSE on July 7, 2003. The Company periodically updates the NYSE on developments with respect to the plan. In the event of delisting from the NYSE, we believe an alternate trading venue would be available.        Working Capital        Our working capital at March 31, 2004, was $22.2 million, compared to $11.2 million at the beginning of fiscal 2004. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6 to 1.0 at March 31, 2004, compared to 1.4 to 1.0 at the beginning of fiscal 2004.        Working capital changes during fiscal 2004 resulted from an increase in accounts receivable of $2.0 million, an increase in inventories of $0.8 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.5 million and an increase in real estate held for sale of $1.4 million. The increase in accounts receivable was due to strong shipments in March of fiscal 2004 versus the same month in fiscal 2003. The increase in inventory was largely due to the purchase of long lead time materials and the manufacture of work in progress needed to fulfill customers' long-term purchase orders. The decrease in prepaid expenses was due primarily to the receipt of an escrow deposit related to a divestiture. The increase in real estate held for sale is due to a pending sale of the land and building retained from a previous divestiture. The number of days that sales were outstanding in accounts receivable increased to 35.2 days at March 31, 2004, from 31.8 days at March 31, 2003. Inventory turnover improved to 1.79 turns from 1.55 turns over the same time period. Current liabilities decreased $11.4 million, primarily due to the payment of state income taxes relating to the sale of Norco, Inc. of $2.2 million, off-set by an increase of $1.1 million for income taxes due resulting from the disposition of a former foreign affiliate, payments due to the corporate office restructuring of $0.8 million, settlement of obligations from divestitures of $7.5 million, reduction in customer advances of $1.5 million and other items of $0.5 million.        Capital Expenditures        Our capital expenditures were $0.5 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $0.6 million for fiscal 2003. The Company initiated the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system late in fiscal 2004 and expects to complete the project in early fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, total capital expenditures are expected to be in a range of $2.6 million to $3.3 million.        Senior Credit Facility        At March 31, 2004, we had a senior credit facility consisting of an $8.0 million asset based revolving credit facility which was established in August 2002 (the "New Senior Credit Facility") to refinance all remaining obligations outstanding under our prior senior credit facility. The New Senior Credit Facility was amended on August 5, 2003 and was amended again on January 30, 2004. The maturity date of this facility, as amended, is July 31, 2004. The current interest rate is approximately 5.0%. The New Senior Credit Facility is secured by all of our assets. We are in compliance with the provisions of the facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at March 31, 2004.        Senior Subordinated Notes        On August 30, 2000, we completed a private placement of $75 million of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock (the "Warrants") to a group of institutional investors (collectively, the "Purchasers"). We used the proceeds of the private placement to retire, in full, a $75 million bridge loan held by a group of lenders led by Fleet National Bank. The Notes, as amended in August 2002, are due on August 29, 2005 and bear interest at a rate of 18% per annum consisting of 13% cash interest on principal, payable quarterly, and 5% interest on principal, payable quarterly in "payment-in-kind" ("PIK") promissory notes. The PIK portion of the interest rate increases 0.25% each quarter, commencing December 31, 2002 until the Notes are retired. We may prepay the Notes after August 29, 2001, at a premium initially of 9%, declining to 5%, 3% and 1% on each of the next succeeding anniversaries of that date. The Notes contain customary financial covenants and events of default, including a cross-default provision to our senior debt obligations. We are in compliance with the provisions of the Notes. At March 31, 2004, the principal balance outstanding on the Notes amounted to $56.4 million, which included the original principal amount plus the PIK notes. At March 31, 2003, we reported redeemable common stock in the amount of $1.3 million representing the per share put right (257,000 shares at $5.00 per share) held by certain Purchasers who had exercised their Warrants and recorded a $2.0 million noncash, non-taxable gain relating to the mark-to-market accounting of the Warrants as a derivative. The put right on approximately 211,000 shares expired on June 24, 2003 and, accordingly, we reclassified in the first quarter of 2004, $1.1 million from redeemable common stock to additional paid in capital with the remainder of the redeemable common stock being reclassified to long-term debt to reflect the                                         11   exercise of the put by a Purchaser. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2004, the Purchaser revoked its put exercise and that portion was reclassified to additional paid in capital in the second quarter. In addition, the put right on 171,041 Warrants expired and, accordingly, $0.9 million representing the cash value of the put right on these Warrants was reclassified from a liability account to additional paid-in capital in the first quarter of 2004. At March 31, 2004, there were 171,041 Warrants outstanding which are each convertible into common stock at the price of $.01 per warrant. These Warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents for the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share at March 31, 2004.        We have long-term debt maturities of $0.1 million and $56.5 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, respectively.        Our operations require significant amounts of cash, and we may be required to seek additional capital, whether from selling equity or borrowing money, for the future growth and development of our business or to fund our operations and inventory, particularly in the event of a market downturn. Although currently we have the ability to borrow additional sums under the New Senior Credit Facility, this facility contains a borrowing base provision and financial covenants which may limit the amount we can borrow. Also, while we continue to have on-going discussions with prospective lenders, we may not be able to replace or renew the New Senior Credit Facility upon its expiration on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, a number of factors could affect our ability to access debt or equity financing, including our financial strength and credit rating, the financial market's confidence in our management team and financial reporting, general economic conditions, the conditions in the defense and aerospace industries and overall capital market conditions.        Even if available, additional financing could be costly or have adverse consequences. If we raise additional funds by issuing stock, dilution to stockholders may result. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt, we will incur increased debt servicing costs and may become subject to additional restrictive financial and other covenants. We can give no assurance as to the terms or availability of additional capital. If we were not successful in obtaining sufficient capital, it could reduce our sales and earnings and adversely impact our financial position and we may not be able to expand or operate our business as planned.  TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES        At March 31, 2004, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $58.0 million and $77.4 million, respectively, which are due to expire in fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2024. These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through their respective expiration dates and thereby reduce or eliminate our federal and state income taxes otherwise payable. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") imposes significant limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the event of an "ownership change" as defined under section 382 of the Code (the "Section 382 Limitation"). The Section 382 Limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre-ownership NOLs that a corporation may use to offset its post-ownership change income. The Section 382 Limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporation's stock immediately before an ownership change by the long-term tax-exempt rate (as published by the Internal Revenue Service). Generally, an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership by value of that corporation by one or more 5% shareholders (including specified groups of shareholders who in the aggregate own at least 5% of that corporation's stock) exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year testing period. We believe that we have not gone through an ownership change that would cause our NOLs to be subject to the Section 382 Limitation.  DIVESTITURES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS        During fiscal 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan to focus our resources and capital on our aerospace and defense products business and exit the specialty fastener segment. As a result, our discontinued operations in fiscal 2003 and 2002 include all of the operations related to our specialty fastener segment, which includes all of the divested operations we describe below.        On July 10, 2001, we sold our Breeze Industrial and Pebra hose clamp businesses to Industrial Growth Partners and members of Breeze Industrial's management for $46.2 million in cash. In a related transaction, we sold the real estate occupied by Breeze Industrial to a quasi-governmental organization for $2.0 million which we may, under certain circumstances, be required to repurchase for $1.0 million in fiscal 2006. We used the proceeds from these sales to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.        On December 5, 2001, we sold TransTechnology Engineered Components to a company formed by affiliates of Kohlberg & Company, L.L.C. for $98.5 million, of which $96.0 million was cash and the balance the assumption of certain liabilities related to the purchased businesses. We used the cash proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility. In the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2001, as part of our restructuring program, we reported a pre-tax asset impairment charge for TransTechnology Engineered Components, Inc. in the amount of $85.8 million to reduce the carrying value of these businesses to estimated fair market value. This noncash charge was related specifically to the write-down of goodwill. The sale proceeds of TransTechnology Engineered Components approximated our adjusted carrying value.        On February 21, 2002, we sold Seeger-Orbis to Barnes Group Inc. for $20.0 million cash. We used the net proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility. Our balance sheet contains a noncurrent asset and a noncurrent liability                                         12   in the amount of $3.7 million relating to the pension plan of Seeger-Orbis. These amounts represent our legal liability under German law and the indemnification we received from the buyer of the business for that liability.        On April 16, 2002, we sold Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers Corporation to Allfast Fastening Systems, Inc. for $3.2 million in cash. We used the net proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.        On May 30, 2002, we completed the sale of substantially all of the net assets of TransTechnology Engineered Rings (USA) to a newly formed affiliate of Sea View Capital LLC for $2.9 million in cash, a promissory note of $0.8 million and warrants for 5% of the equity of the purchaser. We used the net proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.        On July 16, 2002, we completed the recapitalization of our TransTechnology (GB) Ltd. subsidiary, now known as Cirteq, Ltd., by selling 81% of its shares to a new entity controlled by local management for $121 (one hundred twenty-one dollars). We also converted $2.0 million of unsecured intercompany debt into a $2.0 million loan secured by a first lien on Cirteq's real property in Glusburn, England. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.9 million that is included in other income relating to the sale of the remaining 19% interest in Cirteq, Ltd. and the collection of the loan from Cirteq, Ltd.        On August 6, 2002, we completed the sale of all of the shares of TransTechnology Brasil, Ltda. for $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million was paid in cash and the balance in installment payments. We also will be paid $0.3 million of intracompany debt due from the Brazilian unit. We used the net proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.        On January 3, 2003, we completed the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary, TCR Corporation, to a newly formed affiliate of Mid-Mark Capital LLC for $10.0 million in cash. We used the net proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under our New Senior Credit Facility.        On February 24, 2003, we sold Norco, Inc. for $51.0 million cash and a $1.0 million reimbursement for certain income taxes payable as a result of the transaction to a wholly owned subsidiary of TransDigm Inc. We used the net cash proceeds to retire senior debt under the New Senior Credit Facility and partially repay subordinated debt.        For fiscal 2003, the $13.1 million gain from discontinued operations included actual operating income of $7.0 million from discontinued operations, a gain of $28.5 million from the sale of our Norco subsidiary, allocated interest expense of $6.3 million, an $8.2 million charge to reflect the amounts ultimately realized from sales of discontinued business units, a cash charge of $0.2 million from the final settlement of our interest rate swap contracts, a noncash charge of $4.6 million associated with the recognition of accumulated currency translation losses from the sale of our Brazilian operation and a tax provision of $3.1 million.        For fiscal 2002, the $69.6 million loss from discontinued operations included $110.3 million of impairment charges related to reducing the carrying values of the discontinued businesses to their estimated net realizable values, $12.0 million of actual operating income of the discontinued businesses through their expected divestiture dates, $20.1 million of allocated interest expense; $8.4 million from the write-off of capitalized loan fees and the mark-to-market of interest rate swaps required under the terms of our credit agreements, $24.7 million of gains recognized on the sale of certain business units; and $0.2 million of other income or credits associated with the discontinued operations. These gains and losses, which aggregated $101.9 million, were reduced by a tax benefit of $32.3 million.  SUMMARY DISCLOSURE ABOUT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS        The following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations for the next several years:        (Dollars in thousands)                         2005       2006       2007       2008       2009      Total                    --------   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------              Long-term debt     $     79   $ 56,472   $      -   $      -   $      -   $ 56,551 Operating leases        116        115        102         35          -        368                    --------   --------   --------   --------   --------   -------- Total              $    195   $ 56,587   $    102   $     35   $      -   $ 56,919                    ========   ========   ========   ========   ========   ========         In addition, we have divested ten businesses since March 31, 2001. Under the terms of the agreements associated with the sales of those businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers for certain damages that might arise in the event that a representation we made with respect to the divested business is found to have contained a material misstatement, subject in each case to a customary cap on the indemnification amount and customary limitations on the survivability of the representations made. As of the date of this report, we have unresolved claims for indemnification with respect to these divested businesses that aggregate less than $0.1 million. Additionally, the terms of these divestiture agreements generally require the calculation of purchase price adjustments based upon the                                         13   amount of working capital or net assets transferred at the closing date. In the case of each divestiture completed as of the filing date purchase price adjustments have been agreed and paid.  INFLATION        While neither inflation nor deflation has had, and we do not expect it to have, a material impact upon operating results, we cannot assure you that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future.  CONTINGENCIES        Environmental Matters - The environmental cleanup plan presented by the Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 for a portion of a site in Pennsylvania which continues to be owned although the related business has been sold was approved during the third quarter of fiscal 2004. This plan was submitted pursuant to the Consent Order and Agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ("PaDEP") concluded in fiscal 1999. Pursuant to the Consent Order, upon its execution the Company paid $0.2 million for past costs, future oversight expenses and in full settlement of claims made by PaDEP related to the environmental remediation of the site with an additional $0.2 million paid in fiscal 2001. A second Consent Order was concluded with PaDEP in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 for another portion of the site, and a third Consent Order for the remainder of the site was concluded in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. An environmental cleanup plan for the portion of the site covered by the 2003 Consent Order was presented by the Company during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company is also administering an agreed settlement with the Federal government under which the government pays 50% of the direct and indirect environmental response costs associated with a portion of the site. The Company has also reached an agreement in principle with the Federal government and is in the process of finalizing the necessary documentation under which the Federal government will pay 45% of the direct and indirect environmental response costs associated with another portion of the site. At March 31, 2004, the Company's cleanup reserve was $2.0 million based on the net present value of future expected cleanup costs. The Company expects that remediation at the Pennsylvania site will not be completed for several years.        The Company also continues to participate in environmental assessments and remediation work at nine other locations, including former facilities of the Company. The Company estimates that its potential cost for implementing corrective action at these sites will not exceed $0.5 million payable over the next several years, and has provided for the estimated costs in its accrual for environmental liabilities. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company entered into a consent order for a former facility in New York pursuant to which it is developing a remediation plan for review and approval by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. The Company has established a reserve of $2.4 million which it believes is adequate.        In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible party in five environmental proceedings pending in several states in which it is alleged that the Company was a generator of waste that was sent to landfills and other treatment facilities and, as to one site, it is alleged that the Company was an owner or operator. Such properties generally relate to businesses which have been sold or discontinued. The Company estimates that its expected future costs, and its estimated proportional share of remedial work to be performed, associated with these proceedings will not exceed $0.2 million and has provided for these estimated costs in its accrual for environmental liabilities.        Litigation - The Company is also engaged in various other legal proceedings incidental to its business. It is the opinion of management that, after taking into consideration information furnished by its counsel, these matters will have no material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or the results of the Corporation's operations in future periods.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS        In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity," that improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statement of financial position. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations.        In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" that amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement 133. With certain exceptions, SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designed after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this standard will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations.        In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46R, a revision to Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities", which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. Interpretation No. 46R clarifies some of the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements. Interpretation No. 46R is effective at the end of                                         14   the first interim period ending March 15, 2004. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.        In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure" which amends SFAS No. 123. This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. The transition guidance and disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.        In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." This interpretation requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. It also enhances guarantor's disclosure requirements to be made in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. In the normal course of business, we do not issue guarantees to third parties; accordingly, this interpretation will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations.        In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. This statement addresses the diverse accounting practices for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The adoption of this statement did not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        We are exposed to various market risks, primarily changes in interest rates associated with the New Senior Credit Facility under which there were no borrowings at March 31, 2004.                                         15   ITEM 8.
