ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTSOF OPERATIONS      The followingdiscussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be readtogether with our consolidated financial statements and notes to thosestatements included in PART II, ITEM 8 of this report.      Overview of Our Business      Shoe Carnival, Inc.is one of the nation’s largest family footwear retailers. As of January 30,2010, we operated 311 stores in 30 states primarily in the Midwest, South andSoutheast regions of the United States. We offer a distinctive shoppingexperience, a broad merchandise assortment and value to our customers whilemaintaining an efficient store level cost structure.     Our stores combinecompetitive pricing with a highly promotional, in-store marketing effort thatencourages customer participation and creates a fun and exciting shoppingexperience. We believe this highly promotional atmosphere results in variouscompetitive advantages, including increased multiple unit sales; the building ofa loyal, repeat customer base; the creation of word-of-mouth advertising; andenhanced sell through of in-season goods. Our objective is to be the destinationstore-of-choice for a wide range of consumers seeking moderately priced, currentseason name brand and private label footwear. Our product assortment includesdress and casual shoes, sandals, boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoesfor the entire family. We believe that by offering a wide selection of bothathletic and non-athletic footwear, we are able to reduce our exposure to shiftsin fashion preferences between those categories.     Our marketing efforttargets moderate income, value-conscious consumers seeking name brand footwearfor all age groups. We believe that by offering a wide selection of popularstyles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices, we generate broadcustomer appeal. Our cost-efficient store operations and real estate strategyenable us to price products competitively. Low labor costs are achieved byhousing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open-stock format,enabling customers to serve themselves, if they choose. This reduces thestaffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as apercentage of sales. We locate stores predominantly in strip shopping centers inorder to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure tovalue-oriented shoppers.     Our fiscal year is a52/53 week year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwisestated, references to years 2009, 2008 and 2007 relate respectively to thefiscal years ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008.     Executive Summary      Fiscal 2009       During fiscal 2009,we achieved earnings per diluted share of $1.20, a 179% increase over the $0.43earned in fiscal 2008. This increase resulted from a combination of top-linesales growth, strong gross profit improvement and our ability to maintain tightcontrol over operating expenses. In addition:    Net sales increased $34.8 million  to $682.4 million, a 5.4% increase over the prior year.              During the first six months of  fiscal 2009, our comparable store sales declined 3.3%. However, customer  traffic began to increase significantly in August (the beginning of the back  to school selling season), and we saw sustained increases through the  remainder of the year, which drove a 9.5% comparable store sales gain for the  six-month period. For the full year, our comparable store sales increased  3.5%. This sales gain was largely driven by an increase in the average selling  price of our footwear. We were able to raise our average price through an  increase in the sale of higher priced footwear, such as boots and athletics,  and by operating in a less promotional selling environment during the second  half of fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year period.    18          Our gross profit margin increased  to 28.4% from 26.9% in fiscal 2008. Well-controlled inventories and strong  fashion trends resulted in a merchandise margin increase of 0.8%. Buying,  distribution and occupancy costs decreased 0.7%, as a percentage of sales, due  to the leveraging effect of higher sales and a $932,000 decrease in expenses.  Our expense savings were primarily related to cost reduction initiatives  within our supply chain, which resulted in a 15% reduction in distribution  logistics expense.     Selling, general and  administrative expenditures were well controlled, increasing only $2.5  million, or 1.5%, during fiscal 2009. These costs decreased 0.9% as a  percentage of sales year-over-year.     We opened 16 stores and closed  nine stores during fiscal 2009, ending the year with 311  stores.     By slowing our store growth and  tightly controlling all other capital expenditures, our total capital  expenditures decreased $8.4 million, as compared to the prior  year.     We generated $18.1 million of cash  from operating activities (net of purchases of property and equipment) and  ended the fiscal year with $44.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and no  interest bearing debt.     Fiscal 2010       In fiscal 2010, weexpect the positive sales trend we saw in the second half of fiscal 2009 tocontinue, particularly in the first half of the year where the sales comparisonsare easier. However, we will continue to be cautious with our inventories,selling, general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures. Inaddition:    Our per-store inventories are  expected to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in the first  half of fiscal 2010 and low single digits in the second half of the year as  compared to the prior year.     Selling, general and  administrative expenses are expected to rise moderately, primarily due to  increases in employee compensation, including incentive compensation tied to  financial performance, and advertising.     Capital expenditures are expected  to increase $3 to $5 million primarily due to our decision to return to a more  normalized plan of remodeling our stores. We completed a minimal amount of  remodeling during fiscal 2009.     We anticipate opening 10 to 15  stores and closing 10 to 13 stores. We will accelerate our store growth when  we see a sustained improvement in consumer spending and commercial real estate  development.     By controlling thegrowth in our expense structure, inventories and capital expenditures in fiscal2010, we anticipate having positive free cash flow for the year. This would beour seventh consecutive year of positive free cash flow.     Critical Accounting Policies     It is necessary forus to include certain judgments in our reported financial results. Thesejudgments involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual resultscould differ materially from these estimates. The accounting policies thatrequire the more significant judgments are:      Merchandise Inventories  - Merchandise inventories are stated at thelower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Indetermining market value, we estimate the future sales price of items ofmerchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date. Factorsconsidered in this determination include, among others, current and recentlyrecorded sales prices, the length of time product has been held in inventory andquantities of various product styles contained in inventory. The ultimate amountrealized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from ourestimates. We also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period between the lastphysical count and the balance sheet date. The estimate for the shrinkagereserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actualshrinkage trends.      Valuation of Long-LivedAssets  - We reviewlong-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying valueof an asset may not be recoverable and annually when no such event has occurred.We evaluate the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that havebeen open longer than two years. When events such as these occur, the assetssubject to impairment are adjusted to estimated fair value and, if applicable,an impairment loss is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.Our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment, includingcurrent and future economic trends for stores, are subject to a high degree ofjudgment and if actual results or market conditions differ from thoseanticipated, additional losses may be recorded.     19         Income Taxes  - We calculate income taxes and account foruncertain tax positions in accordance with current authoritative guidance.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differencebetween the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assetsand liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets andliabilities are measured using the estimated tax rates in effect in the yearswhen those temporary differences are expected to reverse. We are also requiredto make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income taxexposures. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws andregulations are often complex, ambiguous and change over time. As such, changesin our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amountsrecognized in the consolidated financial statements.      Insurance Reserves  - We use a combination of self-insurance andthird-party insurance for workers' compensation, employee medical and generalliability insurance. These plans have stop-loss provisions that protect us fromindividual and aggregate losses over specified dollar values. When estimatingour self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, includinghistorical claims experience, severity factors, statistical trends and, incertain instances, valuation assistance provided by independent third-parties.We will continue to evaluate our self-insured liabilities and the underlyingassumptions on a quarterly basis and make adjustments as needed. The ultimatecost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals.While we believe that the recorded amounts are adequate, there can be noassurance that changes to management's estimates will not occur due tolimitations inherent in the estimating process. In the event we determine anaccrual should be increased or reduced, we will record such adjustments in theperiod in which such determination is made.      Results of Operations       The following tablesets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales forthe following fiscal years:                  2009            2008            2007   Net Sales    100.0  %    100.0  %    100.0  %   Cost of sales (including buying, distribution, and                            occupancy costs)    71.6      73.1       71.8     Gross profit    28.4       26.9      28.2     Selling, general and                             administrative    expenses    24.7      25.6      25.3     Operating income    3.7      1.3      2.9     Interest income    (0.0  )    (0.0  )    (0.1  )   Interest expense    0.0      0.0      0.1     Income before income taxes    3.7       1.3       2.9     Income tax expense    1.5      0.5      1.0     Net income    2.2  %    0.8  %    1.9  %    In the regular courseof business, we offer our customers sales incentives including coupons,discounts, and free merchandise. Sales are recorded net of such incentives andreturns and allowances. If an incentive involves free merchandise, thatmerchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in cost ofsales. Comparable store sales for the periods indicated below include storesthat have been open for 13 full months prior to the beginning of the period,including those stores that have been relocated or remodeled. Therefore, storesopened or closed during the periods indicated are not included in comparablestore sales.     20         2009 Compared to 2008      Net Sales     Net sales increased$34.8 million to $682.4 million in fiscal 2009, a 5.4% increase from net salesof $647.6 million in fiscal 2008. Comparable store sales increased 3.5%, orapproximately $20.8 million, compared to the prior fiscal year. The 16 storesopened in fiscal 2009 along with the effect of a full year's worth of sales fromthe 24 stores opened in fiscal 2008 contributed an additional $32.2 million insales. These sales increases were partially offset by the $18.1 million of saleslost from the 20 stores which were closed during the last twoyears.     Gross Profit     Gross profitincreased $19.3 million to $193.6 million in fiscal 2009, an 11.1% increase fromgross profit of $174.3 million in fiscal 2008. The gross profit margin forfiscal 2009 increased to 28.4% from 26.9% in fiscal 2008. As a percentage ofsales, the merchandise margin increased 0.8% compared to the prior year, andbuying, distribution and occupancy costs decreased 0.7%. Through tight controlof inventories, we were able to reduce the level of promotional selling on ayear-over-year basis. This, along with strong sales of boots and athleticfootwear, positively affected our merchandise margin. The leverage on ourbuying, distribution and occupancy costs was the result of the sales increasecombined with a $932,000 decrease in expenses primarily due to cost savinginitiatives in distribution logistics. While additional occupancy costs wereincurred for the operation of our new stores, these increases were largelyoffset by rent reductions on certain comparable stores, the elimination of rentfrom the 20 stores closed during the past two years and lower store closingcosts.     Selling, General andAdministrative Expenses      Selling, general andadministrative expenses increased $2.5 million to $168.5 million in fiscal 2009from $166.0 million in fiscal 2008; however, our sales gain enabled us toleverage these costs by 0.9%, as a percentage of sales. Incentive compensationincreased $3.5 million on a year-over-year basis due to our improved financialperformance. Expenses related to employee benefits increased $1.6 million. Thisincrease was associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, whichexperienced an increase in value as a result of the rebound from the fiscal 2008broad-based decline in the stock market. Health care costs increased $1.1million in fiscal 2009 as compared to the prior year. These increases werepartially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in non-cash asset impairments anddisposal charges associated with store closings, along with other operationalcost savings.     Pre-opening costsincluded in selling, general and administrative expenses were $850,000, or 0.1%of sales, compared to $1.0 million, or 0.2% of sales, in fiscal 2008. We opened16 stores in fiscal 2009 as compared to 24 stores in fiscal 2008. Pre-openingcosts, such as advertising, payroll and supplies, incurred prior to the openingof a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred. The totalamount of pre-opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on thespecific market and the promotional activities involved. Our average pre-openingcosts per store increased by $12,000 to $53,000 in fiscal 2009, primarily as aresult of an increase in advertising.     The portion of storeclosing costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses forfiscal 2009 was $750,000, or 0.1% as a percentage of sales. These costs relatedto the closing of nine stores in fiscal 2009 and the impairment of assets andacceleration of expenses associated with management's determination to closecertain underperforming stores in future periods. In fiscal 2008, we incurred$3.3 million, or 0.5% as a percentage of sales, in costs related to the closingof 11 stores and the impairment of assets and acceleration of expensesassociated with management's determination to close certain underperformingstores in future periods. We have identified 13 stores to close in fiscal 2010,five in fiscal 2011, and one in fiscal 2012. However, the potential exists thatfurther negotiations with our landlords could reverse our decision to closecertain stores. We will continue to evaluate underperforming stores, which mayresult in additional closings for current or future periods. The timing andactual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantlydepending, in part, on the period in which management commits to a closing plan,the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and theamount of any lease buyout.     21         Interest Income andExpense, Net      Net interest expenseincreased to $135,000 in fiscal 2009 from $5,000 in fiscal 2008 primarily as aresult of a reduction in interest income. As returns available on short-terminvestments fell to record lows, we held our excess funds for the first sevenmonths of fiscal 2009 in non-interest bearing deposit accounts to offset bankservice fees, which are included in selling, general and administrativeexpenses.     Income Taxes     The effective incometax rate was 39.3% for fiscal 2009 and 36.5% in fiscal 2008. The increase inrate between the two periods was primarily due to the federal tax rate fallingbelow 35% in fiscal 2008 as a result of lower projected income beforetax.     2008 Compared to 2007      Net Sales     Net sales decreased$11.1 million to $647.6 million in fiscal 2008, a 1.7% decrease from net salesof $658.7 million in fiscal 2007. Comparable store sales decreased 4.6%, orapproximately $28.4 million, compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease innet sales was partially offset by a $17.3 million increase in sales generated bythe 24 stores opened in fiscal 2008 and the effect of a full year's worth ofsales for the 25 stores opened in fiscal 2007, net of the sales loss from the 16stores which were closed during the last two years.     Gross Profit     Gross profitdecreased $11.5 million to $174.3 million in fiscal 2008, a 6.2% decrease fromgross profit of $185.8 million in fiscal 2007. The gross profit margin forfiscal 2008 decreased to 26.9% from 28.2% in fiscal 2007. As a percentage ofsales, the merchandise margin decreased 0.8% compared to the prior year, whilebuying, distribution and occupancy costs increased 0.5%. As was seen across theretail sector, heavy promotions throughout the year were necessary to keepinventory turning at an acceptable level and consequently negatively impactedmargins. We experienced a 0.6% increase in occupancy costs, as a percentage ofsales, primarily as a result of the lower comparable store sales, an increase incosts due to the additional stores we operated throughout the year andadditional store closing costs. This increase, as a percentage of sales, waspartially offset by a 0.2% decline in distribution costs. Our distributioncosts, both as a percentage of sales and in dollars, declined as a result of theincreased costs associated with the conversion to our new distribution centerduring the first quarter of the prior year, a reduction in volume for fiscal2008 and increased efficiencies.      Selling, General andAdministrative Expenses      Selling, general andadministrative expenses decreased $764,000 to $166.0 million in fiscal 2008 from$166.7 million in fiscal 2007. As a percentage of sales, selling, general andadministrative expenses increased to 25.6% during fiscal 2008 from 25.3% infiscal 2007. The savings in dollars was primarily the result of a $6.2 millionreduction in advertising costs from our decision to decrease advertising duringnon-peak periods along with a $1.2 million decrease in the expense for employeeincentives and benefits. These decreases were partially offset by $6.0 millionof additional costs incurred from the operation and support of the net newstores opened since the beginning of fiscal 2007.      Pre-opening costsincluded in selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.0 million, or0.2% of sales, in both fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2007. We opened 24 stores infiscal 2008 as compared to 25 stores in fiscal 2007. Pre-opening costs, such asadvertising, payroll and supplies, incurred prior to the opening of a new storeare charged to expense in the period they are incurred. The total amount ofpre-opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific marketand the promotional activities involved. Our average pre-opening costs per storewere $41,000 in fiscal 2008 as compared to $40,000 in fiscal 2007.     22         The portion of storeclosing costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses forfiscal 2008 was $3.3 million, or 0.5% as a percentage of sales. These costsrelated to the closing of 11 stores in fiscal 2008 and the impairment andacceleration of expenses associated with management's determination to closecertain underperforming stores at future dates. In fiscal 2007, we incurred $1.9million, or 0.3% as a percentage of sales, in costs related to the closing offive stores in fiscal 2007 and the impairment and acceleration of expensesassociated with management's determination to close certain underperformingstores at future dates. The timing and actual amount of expense recorded inclosing a store can vary significantly depending, in part, on the period inwhich management commits to a closing plan, the remaining basis in the fixedassets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any leasebuyout.     Interest Income andExpense      Interest incomedecreased to $148,000 in fiscal 2008 from $690,000 in fiscal 2007. The decreasewas primarily attributable to a decrease in the rate available on investments.Interest expense decreased to $153,000 in fiscal 2008 from $264,000 in fiscal2007.     Income Taxes     The effective incometax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2008 and 34.5% in fiscal 2007. The effectiveincome tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily tostate and local income taxes, net of the federal tax benefit and tax credits. Inthe first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded $980,000 of state tax creditsrelated to the investment in our new distribution center, which was the primaryfactor in reducing our effective tax rate in fiscal 2007.     Liquidity and CapitalResources       Our sources and usesof cash are summarized as follows:         (In thousands)         2009            2008            2007   Net income plus depreciation and      amortization    $  30,148      $  22,164      $  28,613     Deferred income taxes      (1,042  )      780        (387  )   Lease incentives      2,211        2,038        663     Changes in operating assets and liabilities      (4,635  )      6,480        (11,378  )   Other operating activities      1,215        616        2,368     Net cash provided by operating activities           27,897        32,078        19,879     Net cash used in investing      activities      (9,685  )              (18,201  )              (18,041  )   Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities      1,139        1,763        (27,500  )   Net increase      (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents    $  19,351      $  15,640      $  (25,662  )    Our primary sourcesof funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolvingcredit facility. For fiscal 2009, net cash provided by operating activities was$27.9 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $32.1million for fiscal 2008. These amounts reflect the income from operationsadjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes.     Working capitalincreased to $176.5 million at January 30, 2010 from $150.5 million at January31, 2009. This was primarily attributable to a $19.4 million increase in cashand cash equivalents and an $8.0 million increase in merchandise inventories,partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in Other current assets. The currentratio at January 30, 2010 was 3.5 and for January 31, 2009 was 3.1. We had nooutstanding interest bearing debt at January 30, 2010 or January 31,2009.     Capital expenditureswere $9.8 million in fiscal 2009, $18.2 million in fiscal 2008 and $18.4 millionin fiscal 2007. No capital lease obligations were incurred during thisthree-year period. Of the fiscal 2009 capital expenditures, approximately $5.3million was used for new stores, $1.4 million was used for remodels andrelocations and $1.3 million was used to replace the software controlling thematerial handling equipment in our distribution center. The remaining capitalexpenditures for fiscal 2009 were used for continued investments in technologyand normal asset replacement activities. Lease incentives received fromlandlords were $2.2 million, $2.0 million and $663,000 for fiscal years 2009,2008 and 2007, respectively. Approximately $500,000 of the lease incentivesreceived from landlords in fiscal 2009 represented monies that were negotiatedfor fiscal 2010 new stores and remodeling activities.     23         Capital expendituresare expected to be $13 million to $15 million in fiscal 2010. We intend to openapproximately 10 to 15 stores at an expected total cost of $3.2 million to $4.8million and to expend up to $4.8 million on remodeling activities. Leaseincentives to be received from landlords are expected to be approximately $1.3million. As part of our long-term strategy to grow our store base and increaseour distribution capabilities, we are in the process of redesigning certainelements of the material handling system in our distribution center.Accordingly, we anticipate expending $1.5 million on these elements duringfiscal 2010. The remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred forvarious other store improvements, along with continued investments in technologyand normal asset replacement activities. The actual amount of cash required forcapital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of newstores opened, the amount of lease incentives, if any, received from landlordsand the number of stores remodeled. The opening of new stores will be dependentupon, among other things, the availability of desirable locations, and thenegotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and businessconditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion.     Our current storeprototype uses between 8,000 and 12,000 square feet depending upon, among otherfactors, the location of the store and the population base the store is expectedto service. Capital expenditures for a new store in fiscal 2010 are expected toaverage approximately $323,000 with landlord incentives averaging $32,700. Theaverage inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from $325,000to $500,000 depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and thetiming of the new store opening. Pre-opening expenses, such as advertising,salaries and supplies, are expected to average approximately $96,000 per storein fiscal 2010. This represents a $43,000 increase over our average fiscal 2009expenditure. The majority of the increase is attributable to our plan tosignificantly expand our advertising for new stores. On a per-store basis, forthe 16 stores opened during fiscal 2009, the initial inventory investmentaveraged $484,000, capital expenditures averaged $360,000 and lease incentivesreceived from landlords averaged $108,000.      Significantcontractual obligations as of January 30, 2010 and the fiscal years in whichpayments are due include:         (In thousands)    Payments      Due By Fiscal Year                   2011 &     2013 &     2015 and   Contractual Obligations         Total            2010            2012            2014            after   Letters of credit    $  10,110    $  10,110    $  0    $  0    $  0   Operating leases      239,261      44,028      74,248      52,357      68,628   Purchase commitments      208,170      208,170      0      0      0   Unrecognized tax positions      1,357      65      0      0      1,292   Deferred compensation      3,548      81      48      101      3,318   Total contractual      obligations    $       462,446    $       262,454    $       74,296    $       52,458    $      73,238    We entered into a newunsecured credit agreement effective January 20, 2010 which provides for up to$50.0 million in cash advances and commercial and standby letters of credit withborrowing limits based on eligible inventory. It contains covenants whichstipulate: (1) Total Shareholders' Equity, adjusted for the effect of any sharerepurchases, will not fall below that of the prior fiscal year-end; (2) theratio of funded debt plus rent to EBITDA plus rent will not exceed 2.5 to 1.0;and (3) cash dividends for a fiscal year will not exceed 30% of consolidated netincome for the immediately preceding fiscal year. We were in compliance withthese covenants as of January 30, 2010. Should a default condition be reported,the lenders may preclude additional borrowings and call all loans and accruedinterest at their discretion. There were no borrowings outstanding or letters ofcredit outstanding under the new unsecured credit agreement at January 30, 2010.Estimated interest payments on our line of credit are not included in the abovetable as our line of credit provides for frequent borrowing and/or repaymentactivities which does not lend itself to reliable forecasting for disclosurepurposes. As of January 30, 2010, $50.0 million was available to us foradditional borrowings under the credit facility.     24         Our prior unsecuredcredit agreement, which also provided for cash advances and the issuance ofletters of credit, was set to mature on April 30, 2010. We did not incur earlytermination or prepayment penalties in connection with the replacement of thiscredit facility. Approximately $10.1 million of commercial letters of credit anda standby letter of credit issued under this credit facility remainedoutstanding at January 30, 2010. The standby letter of credit was replacedduring March 2010 under our new unsecured credit agreement with a similarinstrument. We will maintain cash and cash equivalents of a sufficient naturewith the agent bank until such time all letters of credit have expired. Weanticipate all remaining commercial letters of credit issued under our priorunsecured credit agreement will be satisfied prior to the end of the firstquarter of fiscal 2010.      For purposes of ourcontractual obligations table above, we have assumed that we will make allpayments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligationsthat have a determinable expiration date. We have disregarded the possibilitythat such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended, whetherautomatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and thecounterparty, due to the speculative nature of premature termination orextension. Except for operating leases, the balances included in the "2015 andafter" column of the contractual obligations table includes amounts where we arenot able to reasonably estimate the timing of the potential futurepayments.     We anticipate thatour existing cash and cash flow from operations, supplemented by borrowingsunder our revolving credit line, will be sufficient to fund our planned storeexpansion along with other capital expenditures and other operating cashrequirements for at least the next 12 months.      See Note 5 –"Long-Term Debt", Note 6 – "Leases", Note 7 – "Income Taxes" and Note 8 –"Employee Benefit Plans" to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementscontained in PART II, ITEM 8 of this report for a further discussion of ourcontractual obligations.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     We did not assign anystore operating leases to separate third parties during fiscal 2009. We remainliable on three assignments of operating leases covering former store locations.We believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under theseleases is remote, and no liability has been accrued for these contingent leaseobligations in our consolidated financial statements as of January 30, 2010. SeeNote 6 – "Leases" to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained inPART II, ITEM 8 of this report for further discussion.      Except for theassignment of certain store operating leases and operating leases entered intoin the normal course of business, we have not entered into any off-balance sheetarrangements during fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008, nor did we have any off-balancesheet arrangements outstanding at January 30, 2010 or January 31, 2009.     Seasonality      Our quarterly resultsof operations have fluctuated, and are expected to continue to fluctuate in thefuture, primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales andcosts associated with opening new stores. Non-capital expenditures, such asadvertising and payroll, incurred prior to the opening of a new store arecharged to expense as incurred. Therefore, our results of operations may beadversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre-opening expenses relatedto the opening of new stores.      We have threedistinct peak selling periods: Easter, back-to-school andChristmas.     New Accounting Pronouncements     Recent accountingpronouncements applicable to our operations are contained in Note 2 – "Summaryof Significant Accounting Policies," contained in the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements included in PART II, ITEM 8 of this report.      25         ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKETRISK       We are exposed tomarket risk in that the interest payable on our credit facility is based onvariable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates. Wedo not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes inmarket interest rates. We had no borrowings under our credit facility duringfiscal 2009. A 1% change in the weighted average interest rate charged under thecredit facility would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating by less thanone thousand dollars in fiscal 2008.      ITEM 8.
