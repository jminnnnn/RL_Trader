ITEM 7.      MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in PART II, ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Overview of Our Business   Shoe Carnival, Inc. is one of the nation’s largest family footwear retailers, providing the convenience of shopping at any of our store locations or online at shoecarnival.com.  Our stores combine competitive pricing with a fun and promotional, in-store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and injects fun and surprise into every shopping experience.  We believe this fun and promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages, including increased multiple unit sales; the building of a loyal, repeat customer base; the creation of word-of-mouth advertising; and enhanced sell-through of in-season goods.  A similar customer experience is reflected in our e-commerce site through special promotions and limited time sales, along with relevant product stories featured on our home page.    Our objective is to be the destination retailer-of-choice for a wide range of consumers seeking value-priced, current season name brand and private label footwear.  Our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes, sandals, boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family in four general categories - women’s, men’s, children’s and athletics.  In addition to footwear, our stores carry selected accessory items such as socks, belts, shoe care items, handbags, sport bags, backpacks, scarves and wallets.  Our e-commerce site offers customers an opportunity to choose from a large selection of products in all of the same categories of footwear with a depth of sizes and colors that may not be available in some of our smaller stores and introduces our concept to consumers who are new to Shoe Carnival in both existing and new markets.  Our fiscal year is a 52/53 week year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.  Unless otherwise stated, references to years 2018, 2017 and 2016 relate respectively to the fiscal years ended February 2, 2019, February 3, 2018, and January 28, 2017. Fiscal year 2017 consisted of 53 weeks and the other fiscal years consisted of 52 weeks.    Executive Summary  Overview  Net income increased to $38.1 million in fiscal 2018, or $2.45 per diluted share, compared to net income of $18.9 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, in fiscal 2017.  Despite a low-single digit decline in store traffic, comparable store sales increased by 4.3% in fiscal 2018, and we generated a low-single digit improvement in our conversion rate, primarily due to continued progress with our multi-channel strategy.  Our balance sheet remains strong as of February 2, 2019, with inventory down $3.0 million year-over-year, $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding debt.  Highlights of our performance in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year are presented below, followed by a more comprehensive discussion under “Results of Operations”:        •   Net sales increased $10.5 million, or 1.0%, during the 52-week fiscal 2018 compared to a 53-week fiscal 2017.  Of the $10.5 million increase in net sales, approximately $8.9 million was attributable to the 22 new stores we opened since the beginning of fiscal 2017 and $28.5 million was attributable to the stores in our comparable store sales base.  This net sales increase was partially offset by the loss of $26.9 million in sales from the 40 stores closed since the beginning of fiscal 2017.  Similar to other retailers, we follow the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (the 53rd week).  The loss of this one week of sales in fiscal 2018 negatively affected our net sales comparison, as approximately $13.0 million in net sales were recorded for this extra week in fiscal 2017.  24          •   Comparable store sales for the 52-week period ended  Feb ruary 2, 2019  increased  4.3 %  compared to the 52-week period ended February 3, 2018,   despite a  low -single  digit decline in store traffic.   Customers responded well to our product assortment and marketing  efforts throughout the year ,  and we  posted  comparable  store sales increases in all major product  categories.  Seasonal product categories, such as women’s and children’s sandals and men’s boots ,  all posted double - digit comparable store sales increases.   We continue to offer our customers fresh new styles and  colors from brands that drive the athletic and athleisure trend.  Adult athletics posted a low-single digit comparable store sales increase during the year  led  by women’s athletics, which posted a mid-single digit sales increase during fiscal 2018.        •   Our gross profit margin increased to 30.0% in fiscal 2018 from 29.1% in the prior year.  Our merchandise margin increased 0.3% primarily due to higher margins achieved in the women’s non-athletic category.  Buying, distribution and occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales, decreased 0.6% compared to the prior year primarily as a result of lower occupancy expenses during the year and the leveraging effect of higher sales.      •   In December 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which reduced our maximum corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018.  Our effective tax rate decreased to 24.3% in fiscal 2018 compared to 49.4% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the change in the corporate tax rate. We also recorded additional income tax expense of $4.4 million in fiscal 2017 related to the one-time remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new, lower corporate tax rate.        •   We repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock during fiscal 2018 at a total cost of $46.0 million under our share repurchase programs and ended fiscal 2018 with $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, and we ended fiscal 2018 with no outstanding debt.      •   In fiscal 2018, we continued to invest in our CRM strategy, which is intended to focus our entire organization on a more customer-centric model.  We engaged with a strategic partner that specializes in creating holistic CRM strategies for large and mid-sized retail organizations to provide discovery, implementation, launch and ongoing support for our customer-centric, multi-channel CRM Solution. This new platform will form the foundation of our CRM program and will also serve as the systemic framework for our Shoe Perks loyalty program.        •   In fiscal 2018, we increased membership in our Shoe Perks customer loyalty program by an additional 2.4 million members, which brought total membership to 21.7 million customers at the end of the fiscal year.  For the fiscal year, member sales accounted for approximately 68% of our total business and members on average spent 19% more per transaction than non-members.  The Gold tier represents approximately 35% of our active Shoe Perks members and the average transaction value for these customers is 20% higher than non-Gold Shoe Perks members.  We believe our Shoe Perks program affords us tremendous opportunity to communicate, build relationships and engage with our most loyal shoppers, which we believe will result in long-term sales gains.        •   We began fiscal 2018 expecting to close approximately 25 to 30 stores.  Our management team was focused on improving the metrics of certain stores expected for closure and was successful in making them productive contributors to our store base.  As a result, we closed 14 stores during the year, opened three stores and relocated one store.  We ended the year with 397 stores.    Fiscal 2019       Fiscal 2019 will continue to be a year of innovation for Shoe Carnival.  In the third quarter, we expect to officially launch our CRM Solution.  This launch represents the official implementation of our production CRM database to support customer information, identity management and our CRM campaign management software.  In fiscal 2019 we will continue to invest in our CRM strategy, which is intended to focus our entire organization on a more customer-centric model.  We will continue to work with our strategic partner that specializes in creating holistic CRM strategies for large and mid-sized retail organizations to provide discovery, implementation, launch and ongoing support for our customer-centric, multi-channel CRM Solution.  This new platform will form the foundation of our CRM program and will also serve as the systemic framework for our Shoe Perks loyalty program and CRM campaign manager.  We expect this initiative will give us an improved view into customer data, allowing us to effectively communicate with consumers on a personalized basis. Using primarily transaction data, we are gaining useful insights into our customers’ shopping habits, including where, when and how they shop our stores and navigate our online presence.  Additionally, we are gaining a deeper understanding of the brands and categories our high-value customers consistently purchase so that we can continue to deliver strong performance at a geographic and store level.  Although a large part of customer data comes from our loyalty program, we take a holistic view of CRM.  We believe this approach should help drive continued Company growth in fiscal 2019 as we continue to enhance our loyalty program and CRM capabilities through exclusive offers and personalized messaging and build even greater loyalty and a deeper relationship with our Shoe Perks customers.    25      Increasing market penetration by opening new stores has historically been a key component of our growth strategy. While our focus continues to be on generating positive long-term financial performance for our store portfolio, we do not expect to open  any new stores in fiscal 2019.  As we leverage customer data from our CRM program, and as more attractive real estate opportunities become available, we will continue to pursue opportunities for brick-and-mortar store growth across large, mid-size and smal ler markets in fiscal 2020.      Over the past several years, we have analyzed our entire portfolio of stores, with a concentration on underperforming stores, in order to identify and address stores that produce low or negative contribution and either renegotiate lease terms, relocate or close those stores.  Based on this analysis, we currently expect to close approximately seven to 10 stores in fiscal 2019.    In fiscal 2019, we will also be evaluating key processes underlying our supply chain, order management and fulfillment competencies in order to build a more efficient supply chain, position ourselves for new growth and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction and convenience in an increasingly competitive environment.  We are also partnering with a new marketing agency, who we believe will help us deliver new and unique messaging to our customers and fortify our brand as a distinct and compelling family footwear retailer.   Critical Accounting Policies  It is necessary for us to include certain judgments in our reported financial results.  These judgments involve estimates based in part on our historical experience and incorporate the impact of the current general economic climate and company-specific circumstances.  However, because future events and economic conditions are inherently uncertain, our actual results could differ materially from these estimates.  The accounting policies that require more significant judgments are included below.  Merchandise Inventories  – Our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value as of the balance sheet date and consist primarily of dress, casual and athletic footwear for women, men and children.  The cost of our merchandise is determined using the first-in, first-out valuation method (FIFO).  For determining market value, we estimate the future demand and related sale price of merchandise in our inventory.  The stated value of merchandise inventories contained on our consolidated balance sheets also includes freight, certain capitalized overhead costs and reserves.   We review our inventory at the end of each quarter to determine if it is properly stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Factors considered include recent sale prices, historical loss rates, the length of time merchandise has been held in inventory, quantities of the various styles held in inventory, seasonality of the merchandise, expected consideration to be received from our vendors and current and expected future sales trends.  We reduce the value of our inventory to its estimated net realizable value where cost exceeds the estimated future selling price.  Merchandise inventories as of February 2, 2019, totaled $257.5 million, representing approximately 62% of total assets. Merchandise inventories as of February 3, 2018, totaled $260.5 million, representing approximately 63% of total assets.  Given the significance of inventories to our consolidated financial statements, the determination of net realizable value is considered to be a critical accounting estimate.  Material changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the actual net realizable value of our inventory and our reported operating results.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets  – Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment subject to depreciation, are evaluated for impairment on a periodic basis if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  This evaluation includes performing an analysis of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the long-lived assets.  Assets are grouped and the evaluation performed at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally at a store level.    If the estimated future cash flows for a store are determined to be less than the carrying value of the store’s assets, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value.  We estimate the fair value of our long-lived assets using store-specific cash flow assumptions discounted by a rate commensurate with the risk involved with such assets while incorporating marketplace assumptions.  Our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment, including current and future economic trends for stores, are subject to a high degree of judgment.  Assets subject to impairment are adjusted to estimated fair value and, if applicable, an impairment loss is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Our net long-lived assets as of February 2, 2019, and of February 3, 2018, totaled $70.6 million and $86.3 million, respectively, representing   26      approximately  17%   and 21%  of total assets , respectively,  for both fiscal years .   There were no impairments of long-lived assets recorded in fiscal 2018.   From our evaluations performed during fisc al  201 7 , we recorded impairments of long-lived assets of  $5.1 million on 47  underperforming   domestic stores.   If actual operating results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, the carrying value of certain of our assets may prove unrecoverabl e and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future.   Insurance Reserves  – We self-insure a significant portion of our workers’ compensation, general liability and employee health care costs and also maintain insurance in each area of risk to protect us from individual and aggregate losses over specified dollar values.  We review the liability reserved for our self-insured portions on a quarterly basis, taking into consideration a number of factors, including historical claims experience, severity factors, statistical trends and, in certain instances, valuation assistance provided by independent third parties.  Our self-insurance reserves include estimates of both claims filed, carried at their expected ultimate settlement value, and claims incurred but not yet reported.  As of February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, our self-insurance reserves totaled $3.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively.  While we believe that the recorded amounts are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to management’s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimating process.  If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to future losses or gains that could be material.  Income Taxes  – As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our current and future income taxes for each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.  Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and evaluating our tax positions.  As a part of this process, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Our temporary timing differences relate primarily to inventory, depreciation, accrued expenses, deferred lease incentives and stock-based compensation.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates enacted and expected to be in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those tax benefits are uncertain.    We are also required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures when accounting for uncertain tax positions associated with our income tax filings.  We must presume that taxing authorities will examine all uncertain tax positions and that they have full knowledge of all relevant information.  However, interpretations of guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations are often complex, ambiguous and frequently change over time, and a number of years may elapse before a particular issue is resolved.  As such, changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements.  Although we believe we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, tax authorities could assess tax liabilities greater or less than our accrued positions for open tax periods.    Results of Operations  The following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years:                 2018           2017           2016         Net sales           100.0   %           100.0   %           100.0   %     Cost of sales (including buying, distribution, and     occupancy costs)           70.0               70.9               71.1         Gross profit           30.0               29.1               28.9         Selling, general and administrative expenses           25.2               25.4               25.1         Operating income           4.8               3.7               3.8         Interest income           (0.1   )           (0.0   )           (0.0   )     Interest expense           0.0               0.0               0.0         Income before income taxes           4.9               3.7               3.8         Income tax expense           1.2               1.8               1.4         Net income           3.7   %           1.9   %           2.4   %       27      In the regular course of business, we offer our customers sales incentives ,  including coupons, discounts, and free merchandise.  Sales are recorded net of such incentives and returns and allowances.  If an incentive involves free merchandise, that merchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in cost of sales.   Comparable store sales for the periods indicated below include stores that have been open for 13 full months  after  such  stores ’  grand opening  prior to the beginning of the period, including those stores that have been relocated or remodeled.  Therefore, st ores opened or closed during the periods indicated are not included in comparable store sales.   We include e-commerce sales in our comparable store sales as a result of our multi-channel retailer strategy.     Due to our multi-channel retailer strategy, we vi ew e-commerce sales as an extension of our physical stores.  2018 Compared to 2017  Net Sales  Net sales increased $10.5 million to $1.030 billion for fiscal 2018, a 1.0% increase from net sales of $1.019 billion for fiscal 2017.  Of the $10.5 million increase in net sales, approximately $8.9 million was attributable to the 22 new stores we opened since the beginning of fiscal 2017 and $28.5 million was attributable to the stores in our comparable store sales base.  Comparable store sales for the 52-week period ended February 2, 2019, increased 4.3% compared to the 52-week period ended February 3, 2018.  Despite a low-single digit decline in store traffic, we experienced increases in our conversion rate, average sales per transaction and average units per transaction.  Average unit retail was flat year-over-year.  This net sales increase was partially offset by the loss of $26.9 million in sales from the 40 stores closed since the beginning of fiscal 2017.  Similar to other retailers, we follow the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (the 53rd week).  The loss of this one week of sales in fiscal 2018 negatively affected our net sales comparison, as approximately $13.0 million in net sales were recorded for this extra week in fiscal 2017.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased $12.7 million to $309.0 million in fiscal 2018, primarily because of the increase in net sales and lower occupancy costs.  Our gross profit margin in fiscal 2018 increased to 30.0% from 29.1% in the prior fiscal year.  Our merchandise margin increased 0.3% primarily due to higher margins achieved in the women’s non-athletic category.  Buying, distribution and occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales, decreased 0.6% compared to the prior year primarily as a result of lower occupancy expenses during the year and the leveraging effect of higher sales.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $664,000 to $259.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $258.6 million in the prior year.  As a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased to 25.2% in fiscal 2018 from 25.4% in fiscal 2017.  Significant changes in expense between the periods are as follows:      •   On an overall basis, the net change in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by increases in incentive and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by expense reductions associated with store closings, as described below, as well as reduced costs associated with our deferred compensation plan in fiscal 2018 due to plan performance.      •   We realized cost savings of $8.8 million during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 related to the closure of 40 stores since the beginning of fiscal 2017, net of additional selling expense associated with the operation of 22 new stores opened since the beginning of fiscal 2017.      •   Incentive compensation expense increased $7.1 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.  This increase was primarily attributable to the achievement of certain goals associated with our performance-based compensation during fiscal 2018.      •   Stock-based compensation expense increased $5.1 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the anticipated vesting of a greater number of performance-based equity awards as a result of our financial performance in fiscal 2018.  28      Pre-Opening Costs  In fiscal 2018, pre-opening costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $208,000, or 0.02% as a percentage of sales, compared to $827,000, or 0.08% as a percentage of sales, for fiscal 2017.  We opened three stores during fiscal 2018 at an average pre-opening cost of $69,000 compared to 19 stores in fiscal 2017 at an average pre-opening cost of $44,000.  Pre-opening costs, such as advertising, payroll and supplies incurred prior to the opening of a new store, are charged to expense in the period in which they are incurred.  The total amount of pre-opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved.      Store Closing Costs  The portion of store closing costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 was $2.8 million, or 0.3% as a percentage of sales.  Store closing costs in fiscal 2018 were related to the 14 stores we closed during the year and acceleration of expenses associated with management’s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods.  There were no impairments of long-lived assets recorded in fiscal 2018.  The portion of store closing costs and non-cash asset impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 was $7.7 million, or 0.8% as a percentage of sales.  Store closing costs in fiscal 2017 were related to the 26 stores we closed during the year and acceleration of expenses associated with management’s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods.  We recorded impairments of long-lived assets totaling $5.1 million on 47 underperforming, domestic stores in fiscal 2017.    The timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending, in part, on the period in which management commits to a closing plan, the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the cost incurred in terminating the lease.  Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 24.3% compared to 49.4% for fiscal 2017. Our effective tax rate decreased 25.1 percentage points in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the change in the corporate tax rate under the Tax Act and the additional income tax expense of $4.4 million recorded in fiscal 2017 related to the one-time remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate.  Our provision for income tax expense is based on the current estimate of our annual effective tax rate.  2017 Compared to 2016  Net Sales  Net sales increased $18.1 million to $1.019 billion for fiscal 2017, a 1.8% increase from net sales of $1.001 billion for fiscal 2016.  Of the $18.1 million increase in net sales, approximately $23.3 million was attributable to the 38 new stores we opened since the beginning of fiscal 2016 and $16.1 million was attributable to the stores in our comparable store sales base.  Comparable store sales for the 52-week period ended January 27, 2018 increased 0.3%.  Despite a mid-single digit decline in store traffic, we experienced increases in our conversion rate, average sales per transaction, average units per transaction and average unit retail.  The $18.1 million increase in net sales was partially offset by the loss of $21.3 million in sales from the 35 stores closed since the beginning of fiscal 2016.  Similar to other retailers, we follow the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (the 53 rd  week).  Net sales of approximately $13.0 million were recorded in this extra week, which are included in the total net sales increase of $18.1 million described above.    Gross Profit  Gross profit increased $7.0 million to $296.3 million in fiscal 2017, primarily because of the increase in net sales.  Our gross profit margin in fiscal 2017 increased to 29.1% from 28.9% in the prior fiscal year.  Our merchandise margin increased 0.2% while buying, distribution and occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales, remained flat compared to the prior year.  Our merchandise margin increased primarily due to a $3.3 million gain on insurance proceeds recorded to cost of sales related to hurricane affected stores.  This gain was partially offset by an increase in shipping expense related to our multi-channel sales initiatives.   29      Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.2 million to $258.6 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $251.3 million in the prior year.  As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased to 25.4% in fiscal 2017 from 25.1% in fiscal 2016.  Significant changes in expense between the periods are as follows:      •   On an overall basis, the net change in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by increases in contracted services, wages, stock-based compensation, employee health care and incentive compensation, partially offset by reductions in advertising expense and security personnel.        •   We incurred additional selling expense of $929,000 during fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year related to the operation of 38 new stores opened since the beginning of fiscal 2016, net of expense reductions associated with the closure of 35 stores since the beginning of the same period.      •   Contracted services expense increased $1.4 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to consulting fees related to our CRM initiative.        •   Stock-based compensation expense increased $1.2 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act on anticipated vesting of performance-based restricted stock.        •   Incentive compensation increased $937,000 in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year.  This increase was primarily attributable to achieving certain goals associated with our performance-based compensation during fiscal 2017.  Pre-Opening Costs  In fiscal 2017, pre-opening costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $827,000, or 0.08% as a percentage of sales, compared to $886,000, or 0.09% as a percentage of sales, for fiscal 2016.  We opened 19 stores during fiscal 2017 at an average pre-opening cost of $44,000 compared to 19 stores in fiscal 2016 at an average pre-opening cost of $47,000.  Pre-opening costs, such as advertising, payroll and supplies incurred prior to the opening of a new store, are charged to expense in the period in which they are incurred.  The total amount of pre-opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved.      Store Closing Costs  The portion of store closing costs and non-cash asset impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 was $7.7 million, or 0.8% as a percentage of sales.  Store closing costs in fiscal 2017 were related to the 26 stores we closed during the year and acceleration of expenses associated with management’s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods.  We recorded impairments of long-lived assets totaling $5.1 million on 47 underperforming, domestic stores in fiscal 2017.    The portion of store closing costs and non-cash asset impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 was $5.6 million, or 0.6% as a percentage of sales.  Store closing costs in fiscal 2016 were related to the nine stores we closed during the year and acceleration of expenses associated with management’s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods.  We recorded impairments of long-lived assets totaling $4.5 million on 19 stores in fiscal 2016.  This included $3.6 million of impairments of long-lived assets associated with seven of our stores located in Puerto Rico.    The timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending, in part, on the period in which management commits to a closing plan, the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout.  Income Taxes  In December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted, which reduced our maximum corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.  This rate change primarily impacted selling, general and administrative expenses and income tax expense in fiscal 2017.  In selling, general and administrative expenses, we recorded a $1.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to the change in anticipated vesting of performance-based restricted stock awards.  Additionally, we re-measured our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new, lower tax rate, which resulted in a $4.4 million charge to income tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.  Primarily due to this   30      adjustment to deferred tax assets and liabilities, our effective income tax  rate increased 11.7 percentage points to 49.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to 37.7% in fiscal 2016.  Our provision for income tax expense is based on the current estimate of our annual effective tax rate.  Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows:         (In thousands)       2018           2017           2016         Net income       $   38,135           $   18,933           $   23,517         Depreciation and amortization           21,843               23,804               23,699         Stock-based compensation           10,162               5,017               3,822         (Gain) loss on retirement and impairment of assets, net           (1,264   )           5,511               4,794         Deferred income taxes           (1,440   )           1,418               (1,381   )     Lease incentives           634               4,818               3,825         Changes in operating assets and liabilities           14,721               (12,160   )           10,132         Other operating activities           (8,650   )           (6,993   )           (4,619   )     Net cash provided by operating activities           74,141               40,348               63,789         Net cash used in investing activities           (4,415   )           (19,653   )           (21,832   )     Net cash used in financing activities           (50,959   )           (35,385   )           (47,827   )     Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents       $   18,767           $   (14,690   )       $   (5,870   )       Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility. We believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our cash needs, as they arise, for at least the next 12 months. Our primary uses of cash are for working capital, which are principally inventory purchases, store initiatives, potential dividend payments, potential share repurchases under our share repurchase program, the financing of capital projects, including investments in new systems, and various other commitments and obligations.  Cash Flow - Operating Activities  Our net cash provided by operating activities was $74.1 million, $40.3 million and $63.8 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  These amounts reflect our income from operations adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes.  Working capital was $266.5 million, $263.8 million and $265.5 million at February 2, 2019, February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively.  Working capital increased $2.7 million at February 2, 2019 compared to February 3, 2018 primarily due to an $18.8 million increase in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by a $7.0 million increase in accounts payable and a $7.0 million increase in accrued and other liabilities.  Working capital decreased $1.7 million at February 3, 2018 compared to January 28, 2017 primarily due to a $19.1 million decrease in merchandise inventories and a $14.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by a $26.1 million decrease in accounts payable and a $3.4 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities.  The current ratio was 4.8, 5.7 and 4.1 at February 2, 2019, February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively.  The current ratio decreased 16% at February 2, 2019 compared to February 3, 2018 primarily due to a $14.0 million increase year-over-year in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities.    Cash Flow - Investing Activities  Our cash outflows for investing activities were primarily for capital expenditures.  During fiscal 2018, we expended $7.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment, of which $2.5 million was for the construction and fixturing of new stores, remodeling and relocations.  During fiscal 2017, we expended $19.7 million for the purchase of property and equipment, of which $13.5 million was for the construction and fixturing of new stores, remodeling and relocations.  During fiscal 2016, we expended $21.8 million for the purchase of property and equipment, of which $16.4 million was for the construction and fixturing of new stores, remodeling and relocations.  The remaining capital expenditures in all periods were for continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities.    31      Cash Flow - Financing Activities  Our cash outflows for financing activities were primarily for cash dividend payments, share repurchases, and, in fiscal 2017, payments on our credit facility.  Shares of our common stock can be either acquired as part of a publicly announced repurchase program or withheld by us in connection with employee payroll tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock awards.  Our cash inflows from financing activities have represented proceeds from the issuance of shares as a result of stock option exercises, purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and borrowings under our credit facility.    During fiscal 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $51.0 million compared to $35.4 million during fiscal 2017 and $47.8 million in fiscal 2016.  The fluctuations in cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to changes in share repurchases in each fiscal year. There was $46.0 million of common stock repurchased under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2018 compared to $29.8 million of common stock repurchased under the share repurchase program in fiscal 2017 and $42.6 million of common stock repurchased under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2016.  Store Openings and Closings – Fiscal 2018  We aim to realize positive long-term financial performance for our store portfolio.  We utilize a formal review process in our evaluation of potential new store sites as well as for decisions surrounding leases on existing store locations.  Our approach is both qualitative and quantitative in nature.  We look to continually enhance this process with tools such as real estate software used for portfolio analysis that aid in identifying viable locations for future expansion and identifying potential store closings and relocations, as well as additional information we learn about customers as we implement our CRM program.     In fiscal 2018, we opened three new stores.  On a per-store basis, the initial inventory investment for stores opened averaged $409,000, capital expenditures averaged $278,000 and lease incentives received from landlords averaged $74,000.    Pre-opening expenses included in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $288,000 for fiscal 2018, or an average of $96,000 per store.  Items classified as pre-opening expenses include rent, freight, advertising, salaries and supplies.  During fiscal 2017, we opened 19 new stores and expended $1.3 million on pre-opening expenses, or an average of $70,000 per store.  The increase in the average expense per new store was primarily the result of an increase in advertising expense.       We closed 14 stores during fiscal 2018 and 26 stores during fiscal 2017.  Total store closing costs were $554,000 in fiscal 2018 and $6.5 million in fiscal 2017.  Store closing costs include impairments of long-lived assets, fixed asset write-offs, employee severances, lease termination fees and store tear-down and clean-up expenses associated with closing a store and acceleration of expenses associated with management’s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods.  In fiscal 2017, store closing costs included non-cash impairment charges on fixed assets of $5.1 million.  There were no impairments of long-lived assets recorded in fiscal 2018.  The timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing an individual store can vary significantly depending, in part, on the period in which management commits to a closing plan, the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout.  Capital Expenditures – Fiscal 2019     Capital expenditures are expected to be $21 million to $22 million in fiscal 2019.  Of our total capital expenditures, approximately $7 million is expected to be used for the purchase of our corporate headquarters, approximately $3 million is expected to be used to relocate existing stores and approximately $6 million is expected to be used to remodel approximately 5% of our existing store base.  Lease incentives to be received from landlords are expected to total approximately $1.6 million.  The remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for various other store improvements, continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities.  The actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of stores opened, if any, the number of stores relocated, the amount of lease incentives, if any, received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled.  The number of new store openings and relocations will be dependent upon, among other things, the availability of desirable locations, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending.  32      Store Ope nings and Closings – Fiscal  2019      Increasing market penetration by opening new stores has historically been a key component of our growth strategy. While our focus continues to be on generating positive long-term financial performance for our store portfolio, we do not expect to open any new stores in fiscal 2019.  As we leverage customer data from our CRM program, and as more attractive real estate opportunities become available, we will continue to pursue opportunities for brick-and-mortar store growth across large, mid-size and smaller markets in fiscal 2020.     Over the past several years, we have analyzed our entire portfolio of stores, with a concentration on underperforming stores, to meet our long-term goal of increasing shareholder value through increasing operating income. Our objective is to identify and address underperforming stores that produce low or negative contribution and either renegotiate lease terms, relocate or close the stores. Based on this analysis, we currently expect to close approximately seven to 10 stores in fiscal 2019.  Even though this could reduce our overall net sales volume, we believe this strategy will realize long-term improvement in operating income and diluted earnings per share.  Depending upon the results of lease negotiations with certain landlords of underperforming stores, we may increase or decrease the number of store closures in future periods.  The timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending, in part, on the period in which management commits to a closing plan, the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout.  We will continue to review our store portfolio based on our view of the internal and external opportunities and challenges in the marketplace.    Dividends   In fiscal 2018, four quarterly cash dividends were approved and paid. The first quarter dividend was in the amount of $0.075 per share and the dividends paid for the remaining three quarters were increased to $0.08 per share. During fiscal 2017, the first quarter dividend was in the amount of $0.07 per share and the dividends for the remaining three quarters were $0.075 per share.  During fiscal 2016, the first quarter dividend was in the amount of $0.065 per share and the dividends for the remaining three quarters were $0.07 per share.  During fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, we returned $4.8 million, $4.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in cash to our shareholders through our quarterly dividends.    The declaration and payment of any future dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.  Our credit agreement (described below) permits the payment of cash dividends as long as no default or event of default exists under the credit agreement both immediately before and immediately after giving effect to the cash dividends, and the aggregate amount of cash dividends for a fiscal year do not exceed $10 million.  Share Repurchase Program  On December 13, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $50 million of outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2019. The purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time-to-time through December 31, 2019 and in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The share repurchase program may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not commit us to repurchase shares of our common stock. We have funded, and intend to continue to fund, the share repurchase program from cash on hand, and any shares acquired will be available for stock-based compensation awards and other corporate purposes.  The actual number and value of the shares to be purchased will depend on the performance of our stock price and other market conditions.  As of February 2, 2019, no repurchases had been made under the new share repurchase program, and we had $50 million available for future repurchases.      The new share repurchase program replaced the prior $50 million share repurchase program that was authorized in December 2017 and expired in accordance with its terms on December 31, 2018. At its expiration, we had purchased approximately 1.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $46.0 million under the prior repurchase program.    33      Contractual Obligations   Significant contractual obligations as of February 2, 2019 and the fiscal years in which payments are due include:          (In thousands)       Payments Due By Fiscal Year         Contractual Obligations       Total           2019           2020 &  2021           2022 &  2023           2024 and  after         Letters of credit       $   1,200           $   1,200           $   -           $   -           $   -         Operating leases           295,439               60,807               102,624               75,571               56,437         Purchase commitments           402,268               398,507               2,714               1,047               -         Deferred compensation           12,115               37               116               12               11,950         Total contractual obligations       $   711,022           $   460,551           $   105,454           $   76,630           $   68,387           For purposes of our contractual obligations table above, we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date.  We have disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended, whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty, due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension.  Except for operating leases, the balances included in the “2024 and after” column of the contractual obligations table include amounts for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the potential future payments.  Estimated interest payments on our credit facility are not included in the above table, as our credit facility provides for frequent borrowing and/or repayment activities, which does not lend itself to reliable forecasting for disclosure purposes.    On March 27, 2017 we entered into a second amendment of our current unsecured credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) to extend the expiration date by five years to March 27, 2022 and to renegotiate certain terms and conditions.  The Credit Agreement, as amended,   continues to provide for up to $50.0 million in cash advances and commercial and standby letters of credit with borrowing limits based on eligible inventory, which amount may be increased from time to time by up to an additional $50.0 million, without the consent of any lender, if certain conditions are met.  The Credit Agreement contains covenants which stipulate:  (1) Total Shareholders’ Equity (as defined in the Credit Agreement) will not fall below $250.0 million at the end of each fiscal quarter; (2) the ratio of funded debt plus three times rent to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus rent will not exceed 2.5 to 1.0; (3) the aggregate amount of cash dividends for a fiscal year will not exceed $10 million; and (4) distributions in the form of redemptions of Equity Interests (as defined in the Credit Agreement) can be made solely with cash on hand so long as before and immediately after such distributions there are no revolving loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  We were in compliance with these covenants as of February 2, 2019.  Should a default condition be reported, the lenders may preclude additional borrowings and call all loans and accrued interest at their discretion.  The credit facility bears interest, at our option, at (1) the agent bank’s prime rate as defined in the Credit Agreement plus 1%, with the prime rate defined as the greater of (a) the Federal Fund rate plus 0.50% or (b) the interest rate announced from time to time by the agent bank as its “prime rate” or (2) LIBOR plus 1.25% to 2.50%, depending on our achievement of certain performance criteria.  A commitment fee is charged at 0.20% to 0.35% per annum, depending on our achievement of certain performance criteria, on the unused portion of the bank group’s commitment.  There were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and letters of credit outstanding were $1.2 million at February 2, 2019.  As of February 2, 2019, $48.8 million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility.  See Note 7 – “Long-Term Debt”, Note 8 – “Leases”, Note 9 – “Income Taxes” and Note 10 – “Employee Benefit Plans” to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART II, ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our contractual obligations.    34      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  There were no assignments of operating leases to third parties in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.  Except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of February 2, 2019.  See Note 8 – “Leases” to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART II, ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our lease obligations.  Seasonality and Quarterly Results  Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated, and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future, primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores and closing underperforming stores.  Non-capital expenditures, such as advertising and payroll incurred prior to the opening of a new store, are charged to expense as incurred.  The timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing an individual store can vary significantly depending, in part, on the period in which management commits to a closing plan, the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout.  Therefore, our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre-opening expenses related to the opening of new stores or incur store closing costs related to the closure of existing stores.  We have three distinct peak selling periods: Easter, back-to-school and Christmas.  To prepare for our peak shopping seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other parts of the year.  Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during these peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross margins and negatively affect our profitability.  Our operating results depend significantly upon the sales generated during these periods.    New Accounting Pronouncements  Recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our operations are contained in Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in PART II, ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  We are exposed to market risk in that the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates.  We do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates.  We had no borrowings under our credit facility during fiscal 2018.  A 1% change in the weighted average interest rate charged under the credit facility would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating by approximately $24,000 for fiscal 2017.
