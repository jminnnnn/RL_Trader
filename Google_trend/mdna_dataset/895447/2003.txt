ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  The Company's fiscal year consists of a 52/53 week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 relate respectively to the fiscal years ended February 1, 2003, February 2, 2002, and February 3, 2001. Fiscal years 2002 and 2001 consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal year 2000 consisted of 53 weeks.  Critical Accounting Policies  It is necessary for management to include certain judgements in the reported financial results of the Company. These judgements involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The accounting policies that require the more significant judgements by management are:   Merchandise Inventories - Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. In determining market value, management estimates the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date. Factors considered in this determination include among others, current and recently recorded sales prices, the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory. The ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from management's estimates. The Company also estimates a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. The estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends.  Valuation of Long-lived Assets - The Company reviews long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and annually when no such event has occurred. Management evaluates the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those assets, impairment losses are recorded. When events such as these occur, the impaired assets are adjusted to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Management's assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment, including current and future economic trends for stores, are subject to a high degree of judgement and if actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded.  Deferred Income Taxes - The Company calculates income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to the Company's operations. No valuation allowance has been provided for the deferred tax assets. The Company anticipates that future taxable income will be able to recover the full amount of the net deferred tax assets. The Company's effective tax rate considers management's judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions within which it is subject to tax. The Company has also been involved in domestic tax audits. At any given time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.                                             11  Results of Operations  The following table sets forth the Company's results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years:                                                               2002                2001               2000                                                      ----------------    ---------------     ---------------        Net sales                                                 100.0%              100.0%             100.0% Cost of sales (including buying,    distribution and occupancy costs)                       71.2                71.6               71.3                                                      ----------------    ---------------     ---------------  Gross profit                                               28.8                28.4               28.7 Selling, general and    administrative expenses                                 23.8                23.7               24.1                                                      ----------------    ---------------     ---------------  Operating income                                            5.0                 4.7                4.6 Interest expense                                            0.2                 0.5                0.8                                                      ----------------    ---------------     ---------------  Income before income taxes                                  4.8                 4.2                3.8 Income tax expense                                          1.8                 1.6                1.5                                                      ----------------    ---------------     ---------------  Net income                                                  3.0%                2.6%               2.3%                                                      ================    ===============     ===============   2002 Compared to 2001  Net Sales  Net sales increased $43.1 million to $519.7 million in 2002, a 9.1% increase over net sales of $476.6 million in 2001. The increase was attributable to the sales generated by the 25 stores opened in 2002 and the effect of a full year's worth of sales for the 17 stores opened in 2001 (net of one store closed), partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease of 0.4%. The decrease in comparable store sales resulted from the discontinuation of athletic apparel in all stores and handbags in certain stores. Footwear sales in comparable stores were up 0.1% for the year.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased $14.7 million to $149.8 million in 2002, a 10.9% increase from gross profit of $135.1 million in 2001. The Company's gross profit margin increased to 28.8% from 28.4% in 2002. As a percentage of sales, the merchandise gross profit margin increased 0.6% and buying, distribution and occupancy costs increased 0.2%. The increase in the merchandise gross profit margin was primarily driven by increases in our women's non-athletic category and our adult athletic category. The fiscal 2002 key merchandise strategy of lowering merchandise inventory levels of seasonal fashion product in order to reduce our exposure to markdowns has proven successful in strengthening our overall gross profit margin.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $11.0 million to $123.7 million in 2002 from $112.7 million in 2001. As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased 0.1% in 2002 primarily as a result of higher pre-opening costs. The aggregate of pre-opening expenses for the 25 new stores in 2002 was approximately $2.0 million, or 0.4% of sales, and $1.2 million, or 0.3% of sales, for the 18 new stores in 2001.  Interest Expense  Interest expense decreased to $785,000 (net of interest income of $35,000) in 2002 from $2.3 million (net of interest income of $72,000) in 2001. The decrease was attributable to substantially lower average borrowings outstanding and a lower effective interest rate. The weighted average interest rate on total debt was 4.1% in 2002 and 5.6% in 2001.                                            12  Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate was 37.5% in 2002 and 2001. The effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes, net of the federal tax benefit.  2001 Compared to 2000  Net Sales  Net sales increased $58.4 million to $476.6 million in 2001, a 14.0% increase over net sales of $418.2 million in 2000. The increase was attributable to the sales generated by the 18 stores opened in 2001, the effect of a full year's worth of sales for the 27 stores opened in 2000 (net of five stores closed) and a comparable store sales increase of 3.0%. Partially offsetting the sales increase was an additional week of sales included in 2000. Excluding the impact of the extra week of sales, total sales increased 15.5% from the year 2000 to the year 2001. The increase in comparable store sales was generated by athletic footwear and children's non-athletic footwear.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased $15.2 million to $135.1 million in 2001, a 12.7% increase from gross profit of $119.9 million in 2000. The Company's gross profit margin decreased to 28.4% from 28.7% in 2000 due to a decrease in the merchandise gross profit margin. Buying, distribution and occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales, were flat with the prior year. The decrease in merchandise margins resulted from a decline in the gross profit margins realized from the sale and liquidation of fall and winter product during the fourth quarter. Due to unseasonably warm weather and a very competitive retail environment throughout the fourth quarter, it was necessary to take substantial markdowns, particularly in the seasonal dress and casual shoes, and boots.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12.0 million to $112.7 million in 2001 from $100.7 million in 2000. As a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased 0.4% in 2001 primarily as a result of lower pre-opening costs. The aggregate of pre-opening expenses for the 18 new stores in 2001 was approximately $1.2 million, or 0.3% of sales, and $2.4 million, or 0.6% of sales, for the 32 new stores in 2000.  Interest Expense  Interest expense decreased to $2.3 million (net of interest income of $72,000) in 2001 from $3.2 million (net of interest income of $49,000) in 2000. The decrease was attributable to a lower effective interest rate. Partially offsetting the benefit of the lower interest rates was a slight increase in the average borrowings outstanding over the prior year. The weighted average interest rate on total debt was 5.6% in 2001 and 8.2% in 2000.  Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate decreased to 37.5% for 2001 from 39.5% for 2000. The decrease resulted from lower state income taxes. The effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes, net of the federal tax benefit.                                            13  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company's sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows:    (000's) Fiscal years                                                       2002            2001              2000                                                                ----------        --------         ---------        Net income plus depreciation and amortization                  $   28,324        $ 23,747         $  20,069 Deferred income taxes                                                 296             116             1,237 Working capital increases                                          (1,515)         (1,992)          (18,428) Other operating activities                                            616             459               232                                                                ----------        --------         --------- Net cash provided by operating activities                          27,721          22,330             3,110 Net cash used in investing activities                             (17,724)         (9,369)          (12,979) Net cash used to repurchase common shares                               0               0            (7,576) Net cash (used in) provided by other financing activities          (9,674)        (10,729)           18,997                                                                ----------        --------         --------- Net increase in cash and cash equivalents                             323           2,232             1,552 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year                      5,459           3,227             1,675                                                                ----------        --------         --------- Cash and cash equivalents at end of year                       $    5,782        $  5,459         $   3,227                                                                ==========        ========         =========  The Company's primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Cash provided from operating activities was $27.7 million, $22.3 million and $3.1 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities, $29.2 million, $24.3 million and $21.5 million was provided by operating activities in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Merchandise inventories increased $10.5 million to $146.1 million at February 1, 2003 compared with $135.6 million at February 2, 2002. The net increase in merchandise inventories resulted primarily from the 25 additional stores operated at February 1, 2003 offset in part by a per-store inventory reduction of 5%.  Working capital was $96.2 million at February 1, 2003 and $93.3 million at February 2, 2002. The current ratio at February 1, 2003 was 2.6 as compared to 2.8 at February 2, 2002. The decrease from the prior year was primarily a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capital (long-term debt plus shareholders' equity) decreased to 10.6% at February 1, 2003 as compared to 19.8% at February 2, 2002. Cash generated by operations in 2002 was used to pay down long-term debt.  Capital expenditures, net of lease incentives, were $17.8 million in 2002, $9.8 million in 2001 and $13.8 million in 2000. These amounts include $47,000, $440,000, and $783,000 of capital lease obligations incurred in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Of the fiscal 2002 expenditures incurred, $9.1 million was for fiscal 2002 new stores, $1.2 million for stores to open in fiscal 2003, $1.1 million for remodeling and relocation of existing stores, $2.7 million on computer software and hardware, and $600,000 for additional conveyors and technology for our distribution center. The remaining capital expenditures in 2002 were primarily for various store improvements, loss prevention and technology.  Capital expenditures, including assets acquired through leasing arrangements but net of lease incentives, are expected to be $17 million to $19 million in fiscal 2003. The actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures depends in part on the number of new stores opened, the amount of lease incentives, if any, received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled. The opening of new stores will be dependent upon, among other things, the availability of desirable locations, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas the Company targets for expansion.  In fiscal 2003, the Company intends to open approximately 40 stores at an expected aggregate cost of between $12.5 million and $13 million. The remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for store remodels, visual presentation enhancements and various other store improvements along with continued investments in technology.  The Company's current store prototype utilizes between 8,000 and 15,000 square feet depending upon, among other factors, the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service. Net capital expenditures for new stores in 2003 are expected to average approximately $320,000. An updated store design, which will be used in all new stores in 2003 and beyond, will lower the cost to build a store by approximately 10% from historical levels. The average inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from $450,000 to $750,000, depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the                                          14  timing of the new store  opening.  Pre-opening  expenses,  such as  advertising, salaries and supplies,  are expected to average approximately $67,000 per store. On a  per-store  basis,  for the 25  stores  opened  during  2002,  the  initial inventory investment averaged $604,000,  capital expenditures  averaged $349,000 and pre-opening expenses averaged $79,000.  The Company's  unsecured credit facility  provides for up to $70 million in cash advances on a revolving basis and commercial letters of credit. Borrowings under the revolving  credit line are based on eligible  inventory.  Cash  generated by operations in 2002 was partially used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under this facility by $11.8 million. Borrowings outstanding under the credit facility were $15.2  million at February  1, 2003 and $27.0  million at February 2, 2002. Letters of credit  outstanding  at  February  1, 2003 were $9.0  million.  As of February 1, 2003,  $45.8  million was  available  to the Company for  additional borrowings  under the credit  facility.  On March 12, 2003, the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2005.  The Company  anticipates  that its existing cash and cash flow from  operations, supplemented by borrowings  under its revolving  credit line, will be sufficient to fund its planned expansion and other operating cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  Significant  contractual  obligations  as of February 1, 2003 and the periods in which payments are due include:   (000's)                                                         Payments Due By Period                                          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Less Than           1-3            4-5        After 5 Contractual Obligations                       Total           1 Year            Years          Years        Years - -----------------------                  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------              Line of credit                           $    15,225                        $  15,225 Capital lease obligations                        761        $       468           293 Operating leases                             201,649             29,358        53,702     $   48,689      $  69,900                                          -----------        -----------     ---------      ---------      --------- Total Contractual Cash Obligations       $   217,635        $    29,826     $  69,220     $   48,689      $  69,900                                          ===========        ===========     =========     ==========      =========  See Note 5 for a  discussion  of long-term  debt and Note 6 for a discussion  of leases.  The Company has other  commercial  commitments  in the form of letters of credit where  payment  is  contingent  upon the  occurrence  of certain  events.  As of February 1, 2003, letters of credit outstanding were $9.0 million.  Seasonality  The Company's quarterly results of operations have fluctuated,  and are expected to  continue  to  fluctuate  in the  future,  primarily  as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs  associated with opening new stores. Non-capital expenditures, such as advertising and payroll, incurred prior to the opening  of a new store are  charged  to expense  as  incurred.  Therefore,  the Company's  results of  operations  may be  adversely  affected in any quarter in which the  Company  incurs  pre-opening  expenses  related to the opening of new stores.  The Company has three distinct peak selling periods: Easter,  back-to-school and Christmas.  Factors That May Affect Future Results  This Annual Report contains  certain  forward looking  statements that involve a number of risks and  uncertainties.  Among the factors  that could cause  actual results to differ materially are the following:  general economic  conditions in the areas of the  United  States  in which the  Company's  stores  are  located; changes in the overall retail  environment and more  specifically in the apparel and footwear retail sectors;  the potential impact of national and international security  concerns  on the retail  environment;  the impact of  competition  and pricing; changes in weather patterns,  consumer buying trends and the ability of the Company to identify and respond to emerging fashion trends; risks associated with the seasonality of the retail industry; the availability of desirable store locations at  acceptable  lease terms and the ability of the Company to open new stores in a timely manner;  higher than  anticipated  costs  associated with the closing of  underperforming  stores;  the inability of  manufacturers to deliver products  in a  timely  manner;  and  changes  in  the  political  and  economic environments  in the  People's  Republic  of  China,  a  major  manufacturer  of footwear,  and the continued favorable trade relationships between China and the United States.                                            15  ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The  Company  is  exposed  to market  risk in that the  interest  payable on the Company's  credit facility is based on variable  interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market  rates.  The Company  does not use  interest  rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates. A 1% change  in the  weighted  average  interest  rate  charged  under the  credit facility would have resulted in interest  expense  fluctuating by  approximately $184,000 in 2002 and $335,000 in 2001.                                            16  ITEM 8.
