ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and          Results of Operations  The Company's fiscal year consists of a 52/53 week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to the years 2001, 2000 and 1999 relate respectively to the fiscal years ended February 2, 2002, February 3, 2001, and January 29, 2000. Fiscal years 2001 and 1999 consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal year 2000 consisted of 53 weeks.  Critical Accounting Policies  It is necessary for management to include certain judgements in the reported financial results of the Company. These judgements involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The accounting policies that require the more significant judgements by management are:  Merchandise Inventories - Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. In determining market value, management estimates the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date. Factors considered in this determination include among others, current and recently recorded sales prices, the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory. The ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from management's estimates.  Valuation of Long-lived Assets - The Company reviews long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating whether an asset has been impaired, the Company projects the anticipated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. While we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations.  Deferred Income Taxes - Estimates are made by management for deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred assets and liabilities. These estimates include assessments of future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to among other factors future changes in the income tax laws or changes resulting from audit of tax returns by taxing authorities.  Results of Operations  The following table sets forth the Company's results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years:                                              2001         2000         1999                                        ----------    ---------    ---------        Net sales                                 100.0%      100.0%       100.0% Cost of sales (including buying,    distribution and occupancy costs)       71.6        71.3         70.0                                        ---------     ---------    ---------  Gross profit                               28.4        28.7         30.0 Selling, general and    administrative expenses                 23.7        24.1         23.8                                        ----------    ---------    ---------  Operating income                            4.7         4.6          6.2 Interest expense                            0.5         0.8          0.3                                        ----------    ---------    ---------  Income before income taxes                  4.2         3.8          5.9 Income tax expense                          1.6         1.5          2.4                                        ----------    ---------    ---------  Net income                                  2.6%        2.3%         3.5%                                        ==========    =========    =========                                          11  2001 Compared to 2000  Net Sales  Net sales increased $58.4 million to $476.6 million in 2001, a 14.0% increase over net sales of $418.2 million in 2000. The increase was attributable to the sales generated by the 18 stores opened in 2001, the effect of a full year's worth of sales for the 27 stores opened in 2000 (net of five stores closed) and a comparable store sales increase of 3.0%. Partially offsetting the sales increase was an additional week of sales included in 2000. Excluding the impact of the extra week of sales, total sales increased 15.5% from the year 2000 to the year 2001. The increase in comparable store sales was generated by athletic footwear and children's non-athletic footwear.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased $15.2 million to $135.1 million in 2001, a 12.7% increase from gross profit of $119.9 million in 2000. The Company's gross profit margin decreased to 28.4% from 28.7% in 2000 due to a decrease in the merchandise gross profit margin. Buying, distribution and occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales, were flat with last year. The decrease in merchandise margins resulted from a decline in the gross profit margins realized from the sale and liquidation of fall and winter product during the fourth quarter. Due to unseasonably warm weather and a very competitive retail environment throughout the fourth quarter, it was necessary to take substantial markdowns, particularly in the seasonal dress and casual shoes, and boots.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12.0 million to $112.7 million in 2001 from $100.7 million in 2000. As a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased 0.4% in 2001 primarily as a result of lower pre-opening costs. The aggregate of pre-opening expenses for the 18 new stores in 2001 was approximately $1.2 million, or 0.3% of sales, and $2.4 million, or 0.6% of sales, for the 32 new stores in 2000.  Interest Expense  Interest expense decreased to $2.3 million (net of interest income of $72,000) in 2001 from $3.2 million (net of interest income of $49,000) in 2000. The decrease was attributable to a lower effective interest rate. Partially offsetting the benefit of the lower interest rates was a slight increase in the average borrowings outstanding over last year. The weighted average interest rate on total debt was 5.6% in 2001 and 8.2% in 2000.  Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate decreased to 37.5% for 2001 from 39.5% for 2000. The decrease resulted from lower state income taxes. The effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes, net of the federal tax benefit.  2000 Compared to 1999  Net Sales  Net sales increased $78.2 million to $418.2 million in 2000, a 23.0% increase over net sales of $339.9 million in 1999. The increase was attributable to the sales generated by the 27 stores opened in 2000 (net of five stores closed), the effect of a full year's worth of sales for the 27 stores opened in 1999 (net of one store closed), sales in the additional week included in 2000 and a comparable store sales increase of 2.5%. Increases in comparable store sales were realized in all major footwear categories with the exception of the women's non-athletic category.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased $18.1 million to $119.9 million in 2000, a 17.8% increase from gross profit of $101.8 million in 1999. The Company's gross profit margin decreased to 28.7% from 30.0% in 1999. As a percentage of sales, the merchandise gross profit margin decreased by 1.0% and buying, distribution and occupancy costs increased by .3%.The decrease in merchandise margins resulted from a                                         12  decline in the gross profit margins realized from the sale and liquidation of spring season product, particularly sandals and dress shoes. This was partially offset by higher gross margins realized on fall season product, especially women's, men's and children's boots. The increase in the buying, distribution and occupancy costs was largely the result of higher occupancy costs.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $19.8 million to $100.7 million in 2000 from $80.9 million in 1999. As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased .3% in 2000 primarily as a result of higher advertising costs. The aggregate of pre-opening expenses for the 32 new stores in 2000 was approximately $2.4 million, or .6% of sales, and $2.1 million, or 0.6% of sales, for the 28 new stores in 1999.  Interest Expense  Interest expense increased to $3.2 million (net of interest income of $49,000) in 2000 from $1.0 million (net of interest income of $32,000) in 1999. The increase was attributable to a higher effective interest rate and increased borrowings used to fund the Company's store expansion and the common share repurchase program. The weighted average interest rate on total debt was 8.2% in 2000 and 7.3% in 1999.  Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate for 2000 was 39.5% and 40% for 1999. The effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes, net of the federal tax benefit.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company's sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows:   (000's) Fiscal years                                   2001          2000         1999                                             ----------     --------    ---------        Net income plus depreciation   and amortization                          $   23,747     $ 20,069   $  20,339 Deferred income taxes                              116        1,237       1,131 Working capital increases                       (1,594)     (18,100)    (20,787) Other operating activities                          61          (96)       (328)                                             ----------     --------   --------- Net cash provided by operating activities       22,330        3,110         355 Net cash used in investing activities           (9,369)     (12,979)    (19,441) Net cash used to repurchase common shares            0       (7,576)     (2,424) Net cash (used in) provided by other   financing activities                         (10,729)      18,997      21,241                                             ----------     --------   --------- Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash   equivalents                                    2,232        1,552        (269) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning   of year                                        3,227        1,675       1,944                                             ----------     --------   --------- Cash and cash equivalents at end of year    $    5,459     $  3,227   $   1,675                                             ==========     ========   =========  The Company's primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Cash provided from operating activities was $22.3 million, $3.1 million and $355,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities, $23.9 million, $21.2 million and $21.1 million was provided by operating activities in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Merchandise inventories increased $12.6 million (10.3%) to $135.6 million at February 2, 2002 compared with $123.0 million at February 3, 2001. The increase in merchandise inventories resulted primarily from the 17 additional stores operated at February 2, 2002(a 10.3% increase).  Working capital was $91.3 million at February 2, 2002 and $87.7 million at February 3, 2001. The current ratio at February 2, 2002 was 2.7 as compared to 3.1 at February 3, 2001. The decrease from the prior year was primarily a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capital (long-term debt plus shareholders' equity) decreased to 19.8% at February 2, 2002 as compared to 29.9% at February 3, 2001. Cash generated by operations in 2001 was used in pay down long-term debt.                                         13  Capital expenditures, net of lease incentives, were $9.8 million in 2001, $13.8 million in 2000 and $20.3 million in 1999. These amounts include $440,000, $783,000 and $808,000 of capital lease obligations incurred in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of the 2001 expenditures, $6.6 million was incurred for new stores and $1.2 million was incurred for the remodeling of certain stores. The remaining capital expenditures in 2001 were primarily for various store improvements, loss prevention and technology.  Capital expenditures, including assets acquired through leasing arrangements but net of lease incentives, are expected to be $13 million to $14 million in fiscal 2002. The actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures depends in part on the number of new stores opened, the amount of lease incentives, if any, received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled. The opening of new stores will be dependent upon, among other things, the availability of desirable locations, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas the Company targets for expansion.  In fiscal 2002, the Company intends to open approximately 25 stores at an expected aggregate cost of between $8.5 million and $9 million. The remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for store remodels, visual presentation enhancements and various other store improvements along with continued investments in technology.  The Company's current store prototype utilizes between 8,000 and 15,000 square feet depending upon, among other factors, the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service. Net capital expenditures for a new store are expected to average approximately $350,000, including point-of-sale equipment which is generally acquired through equipment leasing transactions. The average inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from $450,000 to $750,000, depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening. Pre-opening expenses, such as advertising, salaries and supplies, are expected to average approximately $75,000 per store. On a per-store basis, for the 18 stores opened during 2001, the initial inventory investment averaged $627,000, capital expenditures averaged $348,000 and pre-opening expenses averaged $67,000.  The Company's unsecured credit facility provides for up to $70 million in cash advances on a revolving basis and commercial letters of credit. Borrowings under the revolving credit line are based on eligible inventory. Cash generated by operations in 2001 was partially used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under this facility by $13 million. Borrowings outstanding under the credit facility were $27 million at February 2, 2002 and $40 million at February 3, 2001. Letters of credit outstanding at February 2, 2002 were $8.6 million. On March 18, 2002, the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2004.  The Company anticipates that its existing cash and cash flow from operations, supplemented by borrowings under its revolving credit line will be sufficient to fund its planned expansion and other operating cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  Significant contractual obligations as of February 2, 2002 and the periods in which payments are due include:    (000's)                                  Payments Due By Period                             ----------------------------------------------------                                        Less Than     1-3      4-5      After 5 Contractual Obligations       Total      1 Year     Years    Years      Years - -----------------------     ----------------------------------------------------            Line of credit              $ 27,000              $ 27,000 Capital lease   obligations                  1,646   $    923        676  $     47 Operating leases             179,672     25,798     47,590    40,978   $  65,306                             --------   --------   --------  --------   --------- Total Contractual   Cash Obligations          $208,318   $ 26,721   $ 75,266  $ 41,025   $  65,306                            =========   ========   ========  ========   =========  See Note 5 for a discussion of long-term debt and Note 6 for a discussion of leases.  The Company has other commercial commitments in the form of letters of credit where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. As of February 2, 2002, letters of credit outstanding were $8.6 million.                                         14  Seasonality  The Company's quarterly results of operations have fluctuated, and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future, primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores. Non-capital expenditures, such as advertising and payroll, incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred. Therefore, the Company's results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which the Company incurs pre-opening expenses related to the opening of new stores.  The Company has three distinct peak selling periods: Easter, back-to-school and Christmas.  Factors That May Effect Future Results  This Annual Report contains certain forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: general economic conditions in the areas of the United States in which the Company's stores are located; changes in the overall retail environment and more specifically in the apparel and footwear retail sectors; the potential impact of national and international security concerns on the retail environment; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in weather patterns, consumer buying trends and the ability of the Company to identify and respond to emerging fashion trends; risks associated with the seasonality of the retail industry; the availability of desirable store locations at acceptable lease terms and the ability of the Company to open new stores in a timely manner; higher than anticipated costs associated with the closing of underperforming stores; the inability of manufacturers to deliver products in a timely manner; and changes in the political and economic environments in the People's Republic of China, a major manufacturer of footwear, and the continued favorable trade relationships between China and the United States.   ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company is exposed to market risk in that the interest payable on the Company's Credit Agreement is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates. The Company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates. A 1% change in the weighted average interest rate charged under the Credit Agreement would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating by approximately $335,000 in 2001 and $370,000 in 2000.                                         15  ITEM 8.
