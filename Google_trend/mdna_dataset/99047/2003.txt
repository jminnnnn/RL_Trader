We deliver our  products  mainly as aservice bureau  offering and maintain an extensive data center with a network ofelectronic circuits that link industry  participants together and provide accessto the domestic and international equities and derivatives markets.         Headquartered in Stamford,  Connecticut,  we have additional offices inNew York City, London, Chicago and San Francisco.        Our   electronic   trading   systems,    industry-wide   trade   routingconnectivity,  STP and execution  services and systems  supported by our desktopsolutions,  stationary  and  wireless  exchange  floor  systems  and  electronicautomation systems provide a complete  electronic  solution to enter, manage androute trade data and execute orders for brokerage firms and international  bankstrading in equities, futures and options.        We  operate  a  diverse   electronic  order  routing  and  communicationplatform,  our NYFIX Network, based on the FIX protocol. The FIX protocol is themessaging standard underlying language,  which was developed to enable real-timeelectronic  trading  and  communications.  Our NYFIX  Network  is  connected  toredundant data centers enabling electronic  communications between our customersthroughout the equities and  derivatives  markets as well as offering  long-termoptical disk storage and compliance retrieval of customer transactions.  Throughour NYFIX  Network,  we provide  the  technology  and  infrastructure  for tradecommunication   and  global  order  routing   between   buy-side  and  sell-sideinstitutions,  numerous  exchange  floors,  as well as  other  electronic  tradeexecution  venues,  such as ECNs and ATSs.  We sell an  integrated  portfolio ofmodular desktop  trading  applications,  exchange floor  automation and exchangeaccess  applications  for trading in domestic and  international  equities,  andderivatives,  including futures and options.  Many of our applications reside onour centralized  system in our data center and are accessible  through our NYFIXNetwork. By seamlessly  integrating our proprietary  infrastructure and softwareapplications,  we  provide  our  customers  with  a  complete  electronic  ordermanagement and execution solution.        Through NYFIX Millennium,  our 80% owned  broker-dealer  subsidiary,  wehave developed an ATS that functions  similarly to an ECN in that it matches buyand sell orders.  NYFIX  Millennium can match either buy and sell orders or passthem  through to the  exchange or execution  venue of the  trader's  choice,  inreal-time,  which we believe is a unique feature and key differential from otherATSs and ECNs that rely on captive order liquidity.  NYFIX  Millennium  augmentstraditional auction markets by combining the electronic  execution technology ofan ECN with the liquidity of traditional primary markets.  Institutional tradersbenefit from the order  invisibility and anonymity provided by NYFIX Millennium,which  eliminates the negative price impact  associated  with  displaying  largeblocks of shares.  NYFIX Millennium's ATS went into full production on September5, 2001 and we continue to focus on expanding NYFIX  Millennium's  user base andexecution volumes.                                       28                                   NYFIX, INC.ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTSNYFIX TRANSACTION SERVICES        In December 2001, we acquired an inactive  broker-dealer for $34,000 andfiled a  membership  application  with the NASD to  operate  as a  broker-dealerthrough  the  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  which  we  renamed  NYFIX  TransactionServices. The application was approved by NASD in May 2002 and NYFIX TransactionServices  started  generating  revenue  as of July 1,  2002.  NYFIX  TransactionServices  provides  electronic  execution  services,  primarily  to domestic andinternational broker-dealers and specialized trading firms.NYFIX MILLENNIUM        NYFIX  Millennium,  a  broker-dealer,  developed  an  ATS,  which  is anelectronic  system that  matches  buyers and sellers in a  completely  anonymousenvironment.  The system  aims to provide  high  quality  execution  for clientsthrough computerized matching technologies. NYFIX Millennium offers users accessto multiple  liquidity points through a single terminal,  complete anonymity andinvisibility,   intelligent   order  routing  and  the   opportunity  for  priceimprovement and liquidity  enhancement.  NYFIX Millennium  provides an efficientway for major  financial  institutions  and  traders  to obtain  the best  matchavailable for their transactions in the listed equities marketplace.        In September 1999,  NYFIX  Millennium was formed as a limited  liabilitycompany,  by us and seven  international  investment  banks and brokerage firms,consisting of Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro Securities (formerly ING Barings),  LehmanBrothers,  Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Equity Investments Ltd.,  Alliance CapitalManagement  (formerly Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.),  Societe Generale  InvestmentCorporation  (formerly SG Cowen) and UBS Warburg (the "Initial Partners").  Eachof the Initial  Partners  invested $2.0 million in NYFIX  Millennium in exchangefor  25,000  units of NYFIX  Millennium,  collectively  owning a 50%  membershipinterest in NYFIX  Millennium.  We invested $2.0 million and owned the remaining50%. In addition,  we purchased an option to buy, from the Initial Partners,  anadditional 30% membership interest in NYFIX Millennium (the "Option"), for whichwe paid each of the Initial  Partners  281,250  shares of our common stock.  TheOption allowed us to increase our membership  interest in NYFIX Millennium up to80% of the total  membership  interest  through the exchange of one share of ourcommon  stock for each unit of NYFIX  Millennium  purchased,  subject to certainadjustments.        In March 2001, NYFIX Millennium added four more partners,  consisting ofBank of America,  Wachovia  Securities  (formerly  First Union  Securities)  andLabMorgan  Corporation  (formerly  J.P.  Morgan & Co.  and Chase  H&Q) (the "NewPartners").  Pursuant to the terms of the NYFIX Millennium  Operating Agreement,each New Partner  invested  $2.0  million in NYFIX  Millennium  in exchange  for25,000 units of NYFIX Millennium.  We maintained our 50% membership  interest inNYFIX  Millennium  in exchange  for  reducing  certain of our rights to share infuture dividend  distributions of NYFIX  Millennium.  We issued 94,000 shares ofour common  stock to each New Partner in return for the same Option noted above,with LabMorgan  Corporation (as the successor to two partners) receiving 188,000shares.        At December  31,  2001,  our  investment  in NYFIX  Millennium  of $27.5million  consisted  of $25.5  million of our shares of common  stock  (1,968,750shares in 1999 of our  common  stock at $8.89 per  share and  376,000  shares inMarch and April  2001 of our common  stock at $21.28 per share) and our  capitalcash contribution of $2.0 million. We funded certain operating costs and capitalexpenditures on behalf of NYFIX  Millennium.  Such advances of $5.2 million werereflected as "Due from  unconsolidated  affiliates" on our consolidated  balancesheet at December  31,  2001.  In  addition,  we loaned to NYFIX  Millennium  anaggregate of $11.0  million,  plus accrued  interest,  of which $5.0 million wasloaned in 2002.  The $6.0  million  loaned in 2001,  plus accrued  interest,  isreflected  in  "notes   receivable  from   unconsolidated   affiliates"  on  ourconsolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2001.                                       29                                   NYFIX, INC.        On January 23, 2002,  we notified the Initial  Partners and New Partnersthat we would exercise our Option,  effective  February 1, 2002. In exchange forthe  increased  membership  interest  in NYFIX  Millennium,  we paid the InitialPartners and New  Partners an  aggregate  of 296,250  shares of our common stockwith a fair value of $4.5 million,  with each Initial Partner  receiving  33,750shares of common stock and each New Partner  receiving  15,000  shares of commonstock. As a result,  we increased our ownership of NYFIX  Millennium to 80%. Theresults  of  operations  of NYFIX  Millennium  have  been  included  in our 2002consolidated  statement of operations  since the acquisition  date. All advancesand loans,  including  accrued  interest,  have been eliminated in consolidationcommencing on February 1, 2002.  The excess of the purchase  price over the fairvalue of the net assets  acquired  was $27.8  million  and has been  recorded asgoodwill. Some of our key considerations for the acquisition of NYFIX Millenniumincluded  NYFIX  Millennium's  growth  in  revenue,  the  attractiveness  of thesynergies we anticipated with our  recently-acquired  NYFIX Transaction Servicesbroker-dealer,  and our  ability  to  exercise  significant  control  over NYFIXMillennium's operations.        Pursuant to our NYFIX Millennium  Operating  Agreement,  as amended, thefirst $22.0 million in NYFIX  Millennium  operating  losses since  inception wasallocated to the Initial Partners and New Partners,  which equaled the extent oftheir capital  contribution to NYFIX Millennium.  The minority interest in NYFIXMillennium  disclosed in our accompanying  consolidated  statement of operationsfor the year ended December 31, 2002 reflects the allocation of NYFIX Millenniumlosses to the Initial  Partners and New Partners post  acquisition to the extentof their capital contribution, thereby reducing their minority interest to zero.In addition, we recognized NYFIX Millennium operating losses of $6.0 million forthe year ended  December  31,  2002,  which were $4.0  million  greater than ourcapital  contribution  of $2.0 million.  While we expect NYFIX  Millennium to beprofitable in the future, there can be no assurances of such profitability. As aresult, we have not allocated to the Initial Partners and New Partners their prorata share of NYFIX  Millennium  losses in excess of our  capital  contribution,aggregating  $1.0  million,  at  December  31,  2002,  since  we  cannot  assurerecoverability  of the asset that such an allocation would create.  At such timewhen NYFIX  Millennium  achieves  profitability,  24% of its profits,  net of usrecovering our over-allocated  losses, will be allocated to the Initial Partnersand New Partners.JAVELIN        On March 31, 2002, we acquired 100% of the outstanding  capital stock ofJavelin.  We financed the transaction with a combination of (i) $10.0 million innet cash; (ii) 2,784,896 shares of our common stock having a fair value of $41.2million;  and (iii)  493,699  shares of our common  stock having a fair value of$3.5 million  reserved  for  issuance  upon  exercise of Javelin  stock  optionsassumed  by us.  The  excess of the  purchase  price over the fair value of netassets acquired was $42.3 million and has been recorded as goodwill.  Javelin isa  provider  of  electronic  trade  communication  technology  and FIX  protocoltechnology.  The FIX protocol is the  messaging  standard  underlying  language,which was developed to enable real-time  electronic trading and  communications.In utilizing the FIX protocol technology, companies can eliminate the high costsand  associated  risks of  developing  their own  proprietary  network links andimplementing a non-standard  protocol.  Javelin has over 1,000  installations atmore than 350 major buy and sell-side institutions,  securities clearing houses,hedge fund managers, exchanges and ECNs worldwide,  including over 50 clients inEurope and 20 in Asia.  Some of our key  considerations  for the  acquisition ofJavelin included:  increased  connectivity to the buy-side institutional market,consolidated  product  offering,  cross-selling of core products and transactionservices,  and a single point of  electronic  exchange  access  across all majordomestic and international equity and derivatives exchanges.EUROLINK                                       30                                   NYFIX, INC.        On March 6, 2002, we acquired a convertible  preferred stock interest inEuroLink with its operations  based in Madrid,  Spain, for $4.0 million in cash.EuroLink offers the European securities industry direct electronic access to theU.S. equity markets from Europe. EuroLink offers our equity terminals and marketaccess  services to the European  marketplace,  primarily on a  transaction  feebasis.  The preferred stock will  automatically  convert into a 40% common stockinterest  upon the  earlier  of two years  from the date of the  agreement  or achange of control, as defined,  of EuroLink.  We also have an option to purchaseup to an  additional  40% common stock  interest in EuroLink from certain of itsstockholders  at a price to be  determined  based upon a formula  of  EuroLink'searnings, as defined.RENAISSANCE        On October 2, 2002,  we  acquired  an 18%  interest  in  Renaissance,  alimited  liability  company.  Renaissance was formed to commercialize the NASDAQPlatform.  We acquired our  interest in return for 300,000  shares of our commonstock with a fair value of $1.1  million.  We have also loaned  $1.5  million toRenaissance, for which Renaissance issued a convertible secured promissory note.The Note bears an interest rate of 5.5%,  is due in October 2007 or earlier,  asset forth therein, and is convertible into additional equity in Renaissance,  atour option, at certain times over the next five years. We also have an option topurchase up to a controlling interest in Renaissance at a price to be determinedbased  upon a  formula,  as  defined.  In  connection  with our  investment,  weacquired,  for $1.0 million, the intellectual property rights and source code tothe Platform,  which was  developed  over the last several years by a major bankand brokerage firm and contributed such intellectual  property rights and sourcecode to Renaissance.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Resultsof Operations discusses our consolidated  financial statements,  which have beenprepared in accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in theUnited  States of America.  These  principles  require us to make  estimates andassumptions  which could  materially  affect the reported  amounts of assets andliabilities and the disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the dateof the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenue and expenseduring the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates andassumptions,   including   those  related  to  accounts   receivable   reserves,investments,   goodwill,   long-lived  assets,   revenue  recognition,   productenhancement  costs,  income taxes and  contingencies.  We base our estimates andassumptions  on  historical  experience  and on various  other  factors that arebelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form thebasis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilitiesthat are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ fromthese estimates under different assumptions or conditions.        We believe the following accounting policies, among others, are criticalto the understanding of our results of operations due to the assumptions we mustmake in their  application.  Senior management has discussed the development andselection  of  these  accounting  policies,  and  estimates,   and  the  relateddisclosures  with  the  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  ("AuditCommittee"). See Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 15 of this  Annual  Report  on Form  10-K  for our  significant  accountingpolicies.REVENUE RECOGNITION        Our revenue is comprised of  subscription,  sale,  service  contract andtransaction components.        Subscription   revenue  contracts  are  generally  for  leasing  of  ourequipment  and use of our NYFIX  Network,  with an initial  term of one to threeyears  with  automatic  renewal  periods  unless  we  receive  prior  notice  of                                       31                                   NYFIX, INC.cancellation.  Under  the terms of the  subscription  contracts,  customers  aretypically  invoiced  a flat  periodic  charge  after  initial  installation  andacceptance.  Revenue  related to these  contracts is recognized over the initialterm of the  contract  on a  straight-line  basis.  We also  include  within oursubscription revenue,  telecommunication and other charges,  which we provide tothe customer at cost plus a normal  profit.  Such revenue is  recognized  as theservices are provided. As we have no history of significant cancellations, we donot record a reserve for cancellations.        Sale  revenue,  which is  comprised  of software  and capital  equipmentsales,  is  recognized  when the  software and  equipment  have been shipped andaccepted  by the  customer  and when other  contractual  obligations,  includinginstallation if applicable,  have been satisfied and collection of the resultingreceivable is reasonably  assured.  As we have no history of  significant  salesreturns, we do not record a reserve for sales returns and allowances.        Service contract  revenue,  which is comprised of maintenance  contractsfor  subscription  equipment and software and capital  equipment,  is recognizedover the  contract  period  on a  straight-line  basis.  Service  contracts  forsubscription equipment are generally co-terminus with the subscription contract.Service  contracts  for  software and capital  equipment  are  generally  for aninitial  term of one to three years with  automatic  renewal  periods  unless wereceive prior notice of cancellation.        Transaction  revenue  contracts  provide for  transaction  or  executionservices,  which are  comprised of a usage or  transaction-based  fee for tradesexecuted  through our  broker-dealer  operations.  Revenue on these contracts isgenerally  invoiced  in  arrears  and  recognized  in the  period in which it isearned.  We  periodically  enter  into  contracts,  which  include  subscriptionequipment   and   telecommunication   charges  to  be   invoiced  at  a  minimumtransaction-based  fee.  We account  for these  contracts  as both  subscriptionrevenue,  for its minimal fee, and transaction revenue, for the amount earned inexcess of its minimal fee. We value the minimal fee as the fair value of similarsubscription equipment leased and telecommunication  charges provided to similarcustomers.        Certain   subscription  and  service  contract  agreements  provide  forinvoicing  in advance  of the  service  being  performed,  generally  quarterly.Revenue on contracts  invoiced in advance is deferred and  recognized as revenueover the period earned and is included in "deferred revenue" in our accompanyingconsolidated  balance sheets.  Shipping,  handling and installation  charges, ifany,  are  generally  invoiced to a customer  and are  included in revenue  uponcompletion of the installation.        We  periodically   enter  into   arrangements   that  include   multipledeliverables,  which  typically  consist  of the sale of  software  and  capitalequipment with additional services,  such as installation,  training and serviceamong others. Services provided subsequent to initial delivery and installationsare typically invoiced separately. We account for each element of an arrangementwith  multiple  deliverables  separately.   The  arrangement   consideration  isallocated to each element  based on the  relative  fair values of each  element.Vendor  specific  objective  evidence  for fair value of services  is  primarilydetermined by reference to renewal pricing.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE        Accounts  receivable  are stated at net  realizable  value by  recordingallowances  for  those  accounts  receivable  amounts  that  we  believe  to  beuncollectible.  The estimate of our allowance for doubtful  accounts is based oncollection  experience,  which  includes  analyzing  prior  accounts  receivablewritten-off  and reviewing the aging of the accounts  receivable.  Our allowancefor doubtful  accounts  includes amounts for specific accounts that are believedto be  uncollectible,  as well as amounts  that have been  computed  by applyingcertain  percentages  based on  historical  loss  trends,  to  certain  accountsreceivable  aging  categories,  net of  accounts  receivable  for which  revenuerecognition has been deferred.                                       32                                   NYFIX, INC.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT        Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated  depreciation.Included in equipment are certain costs related to the  development of our NYFIXNetwork to support our subscription and service based businesses.BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL        Business  combinations  are accounted  for under the purchase  method ofaccounting and include the results of operations of the acquired businesses fromthe dates of their respective acquisition.  Net assets of acquired companies arerecorded  at  their  fair  value  to us at the  date  of  acquisition.  Goodwillrepresents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired.We adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")  No.  142,GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE  ASSETS effective  January 1, 2002, which requiresthat goodwill and certain other  intangible  assets having  indefinite  lives nolonger be amortized to income, but instead be tested for impairment  annually aswell as on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances  indicate thatgoodwill might be impaired.  Effective  October 1, 2002, we performed the annualtest for impairment using the discounted cash flow valuation  method.  There wasno impairment to the value of our recorded goodwill.CAPITALIZED PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT COSTS        We capitalize certain costs of internally  developed software as productenhancement costs.  Internally  capitalized costs consist of payroll and payrollrelated costs,  purchased  materials and services and software to be used withinour products.  We defer those costs that significantly enhance the marketabilityor  significantly  extend  the  life of our  products.  We are  required  to useprofessional  judgment in determining whether product enhancement costs meet thecriteria for immediate  expense or  capitalization,  in accordance with SFAS No.86,  ACCOUNTING  FOR THE  COSTS OF  COMPUTER  SOFTWARE  TO BE SOLD,  LEASED,  OROTHERWISE   MARKETED.   Product   enhancement  costs  are  amortized  using  thestraight-line method over three years.LONG-LIVED ASSETS        We review the carrying value of long-lived  assets,  including  propertyand equipment,  intangible  assets,  investments and other long-term amounts duefrom  unconsolidated  affiliates,  and capitalized product enhancement costs forimpairment  whenever events or  circumstances  indicate that the carrying amountmay not be fully  recoverable.  If such an event or  circumstances  occurs,  therelated  estimated  fair value of the assets  would be compared to the  carryingamount,  and if needed, we would record an impairment to the extent by which thecarrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset.  There was no impairment oflong-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.INCOME TAXES        Income taxes are  accounted  for under the asset and  liability  method.Under this method,  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized  based onthe  estimated  future tax  consequences  of  differences  between the financialstatement  carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities and their  respective taxbases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using presently enactedtax rates in effect for the periods the temporary differences are expected to besettled. A valuation allowance is established, as needed, to reduce net deferred                                       33                                   NYFIX, INC.tax assets to realizable  value.

Subscription  fees  currently  represent a majority oftotal  revenue.  Subscription  revenue  contracts are primarily  with  brokeragefirms,  international  banks and global exchanges  trading in equities,  and aregenerally  for an initial  period of one to three years with  automatic  renewalperiods, unless we receive prior notice of cancellation. Subscription revenue isrecognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lives  of  the  subscriptionagreements  and  begins  once  installation  is  complete  and  accepted  by thecustomer.  Sale  revenue,  which is comprised of software and capital  equipmentsales, is generated primarily by sales to customers in the futures,  options andcurrencies  trading  market,  and is recognized upon shipment of the product andacceptance by the customer. Service contract revenue is comprised of maintenancecontracts for software and capital  equipment sales and  subscription  equipmentand is recognized  over the contract period on a  straight-line  basis.  Servicecontract revenue is typically  charged to customers as a fixed percentage of theoriginal sale contract.  Transaction  revenue consists of per-share fees chargedto customers who route orders through our order matching  system,  and per-sharefees charged to customers,  primarily domestic and international  broker-dealersand  specialized  trading  firms,  to provide  execution and smart order routingsolutions.        Cost of revenue  principally  consists of costs associated with our datacenters  where  we  maintain   equipment  and   infrastructure  to  support  our                                       35                                   NYFIX, INC.operations,  amortization of capitalized product enhancement costs, depreciationof subscription equipment and execution, clearing fees and market data feeds.        Selling, general and administrative expense accounts for the majority ofour  operating  expense and consists of salaries and  benefits,  rent and officeexpense,  provision for doubtful accounts and marketing expense. During the pastseveral years,  we have expanded our efforts to support an increasing  number ofservices and to increase the number of exchanges,  sell-side  firms and buy-sideinstitutions connecting to our NYFIX Network.        Research and development  expense relates to developing new products andtechnologies to meet the current and future needs of our customers.  These costsconsist  primarily of salaries and related costs for  technical and  programmingpersonnel.        Depreciation  and  amortization  expense  consists of  depreciation  andamortization of corporate equipment and software, and amortization of intangibleassets.        Certain   reclassifications   have  been   made  in  the  prior   years'consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year's presentation.In connection  therewith,  we reclassified  certain operating expense to cost ofrevenue, during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.        The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction withthe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  Historical results arenot necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001REVENUE        Total  revenue  increased  $14.4  million,  or 35%, to $55.8 million for2002, from $41.4 million for 2001,  primarily due to revenue attributable to ourrecently  acquired Javelin  business,  transaction  revenue  attributable to ourrecently acquired  broker-dealer  subsidiaries,  and increased  subscription andservice contract  revenue from increased demand from our existing  customers andthe  addition of new  customers.  These  amounts were  slightly  offset by lowerrevenue attributable to capital sales of software and hardware.        Subscription  revenue  increased $2.7 million,  or 10%, to $31.7 millionfor 2002,  from $29.0 million for 2001,  primarily due to  subscription  revenueattributable to our recently acquired Javelin and NYFIX Millennium businesses of$1.8 million,  increased demand from our existing customers and the net additionof  new  customers,   of  $0.9  million.  As  a  percentage  of  total  revenue,subscription  revenue  decreased to 56.8% in 2002 from 70.0% in 2001,  primarilydue to the addition of  transaction  revenue in 2002 and the increase of servicecontract  revenue of $3.6 million for our recently  acquired  Javelin  products.Without transaction revenue, subscription revenue would have been 65.1% of totalrevenue.        Sale revenue  increased  $0.4 million,  or 5%, to $8.5 million for 2002,from $8.1  million for 2001.  Sale  revenue  increased  $2.8  million due to ourrecently  acquired Javelin  business.  This amount was  significantly  offset bylower sale revenue for our core products of $2.4 million, principally due to ourcontinued  effort to convert  customers to our  subscription-based  model.  As apercentage  of total  revenue,  sales revenue  decreased to 15.3% in 2002,  from19.6% in 2001,  partially  due to the  effect  of the  addition  of  transactionrevenue and the general  slower  growth of sale revenue  compared with our otherrevenue components during 2002.        Service contract revenue increased $4.2 million, or 96%, to $8.5 millionfor 2002,  from $4.3 million in 2001.  The increase is primarily  due to servicecontract revenue of our recently acquired Javelin business of $3.6 million,  andan  increase in  subscription  contract  revenue  for our core  products of $0.6million. As a percentage of total revenue, service contract revenue was 15.2% in                                       36                                   NYFIX, INC.2002, as compared to 10.4% in 2001, primarily due to the aforementioned  servicecontract revenue for our recently acquired Javelin  business,  offset in part bythe effect of the addition of transaction revenue during 2002.        Transaction  revenue  amounted to $7.1 million for 2002, and represented12.7% of total revenue for the year. Transaction revenue was attributable to ourbroker-dealer  businesses,  including NYFIX Transaction Services,  which startedgenerating  revenue on July 1, 2002,  and NYFIX  Millennium,  whose results havebeen included in our consolidated  financial statements since our acquisition ofNYFIX Millennium on February 1, 2002.COST OF REVENUE        Total cost of revenue increased $12.6 million,  or 89%, to $26.7 millionfor 2002,  from $14.1 million in 2001,  due  primarily to increased  data centercosts of $3.8  million,  clearing,  execution  and other  costs  related  to ourrecently acquired NYFIX Millennium and NYFIX Transaction Services businesses, of$2.5 million,  increased  costs  attributable  to support our recently  acquiredJavelin  business of $2.5 million,  increased  telecommunication  charges due tomore desktop  connections and increased  capacity in our data centers to supportour core business, of $1.7 million,  increased depreciation expense attributableto  investment  in data center  equipment  to support our  subscription  revenuecomponents,  of $1.3  million,  and  increased  amortization  expense of productenhancement costs due to continued efforts to maintain  competitive  products of$0.6 million.        Subscription  cost of revenue  increased $4.1 million,  or 34%, to $16.1million for 2002,  from $12.0 million for 2001,  primarily due to increased datacenter  costs,   including   telecommunication   charges  due  to  more  desktopconnections  and  increased  capacity  in our  data  centers,  of $2.5  million,increased costs  attributable to our recently  acquired Javelin business of $0.7million,  increased  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  of $0.7  million,attributable  to increased  subscription  equipment at our customers,  increasedinvestment in our data center equipment to support our subscription revenue, andproduct  enhancement  costs due to  continued  efforts to  maintain  competitiveproducts. As a percentage of subscription revenue,  subscription cost of revenueincreased to 50.8% in 2002 from 41.5% in 2001, primarily due to increases in theaforementioned  costs  related  to  investments  in our data  centers,  which webelieve will support future revenue growth.        Sale cost of revenue increased $1.2 million, or 132% to $2.1 million for2002,  from $0.9  million  for 2001.  The  increase  in sale cost of  revenue isprimarily  due to increased  labor costs to deliver and install our hardware andsoftware  of  $0.9  million,  attributable  to  our  recently  acquired  Javelinbusiness, and increased  amortization expense, of $0.3 million,  attributable tocapitalized software included in our products.  As a percentage of sale revenue,sale cost of revenue  increased to 24.3% in 2002, from 11.0% in 2001,  primarilydue to the aforementioned cost increases.        Service contract cost of revenue increased $0.7 million,  or 55% to $1.9million for 2002,  from $1.2 million in 2001. The increase is principally due toservice  contract labor costs of our recently  acquired Javelin business of $0.7million.  As a percentage of service contract revenue,  service contract cost ofrevenue decreased to 22.6% in 2002, as compared to 28.7% in 2001.        Transaction  cost of revenue was $6.6 million for 2002, and  represented93.1% of transaction  revenue.  Transaction  cost of revenue was attributable toour previously mentioned broker-dealer  businesses,  including NYFIX TransactionServices,   which  started  generating  revenue  on  July  1,  2002,  and  NYFIXMillennium,  which  results  have been  included in our  consolidated  financialstatements  since our  acquisition  of NYFIX  Millennium  on  February  1, 2002.Transaction  cost of revenue  primarily  included  data center  cost,  includinglabor,  maintenance,  lease,  communication  and  data  feed  expenses,  of $3.3million,  clearing and execution  related fees of $1.9 million and  depreciationand amortization expense of $1.0 million.                                       37                                   NYFIX, INC.GROSS PROFIT        Gross  profit  decreased  to 52.1% for 2002,  from  65.8% for 2001.  Thedecrease in gross profit is primarily  attributable to the impact of lower grossprofit for our recently acquired Javelin business, the impact of increased laborcosts to deliver and install our hardware and software,  increased  depreciationand  amortization  expense  of our  product  enhancement  costs and data  centerinfrastructure  investments to support our subscription and transaction  revenuecomponents.        Subscription  gross profit  decreased to 49.2% for 2002,  from 58.5% for2001. The decrease in subscription gross profit is primarily attributable to theimpact of lower gross  profit for our  recently  acquired  Javelin  business anddepreciation and amortization  expense related to our product  enhancement costsand capital and  telecommunication  infrastructure  investments made in our datacenter.        Sale gross profit  decreased to 75.7% for 2002, from 89.0% for 2001. Thedecrease in sale gross profit is primarily  attributable  to the impact of lowergross  profit  for  our  recently   acquired   Javelin  business  and  increaseddepreciation  expense  attributable to software capitalized which is included inour products delivered to our customers.        Service  contract gross profit  increased to 77.4% for 2002,  from 71.3%for  2001.   The  increase  in  service   contract  gross  profit  is  primarilyattributable  to the impact of higher  gross  profit for our  recently  acquiredJavelin business.        Transaction gross profit was 6.9% for 2002. Transaction gross profit wasadversely  affected by the impact of certain fixed costs  incurred  prior to thestart of our NYFIX  Transaction  Services  business,  which  started  generatingrevenue on July 1, 2002, and NYFIX Millennium,  which results have been includedin  our  consolidated  financial  statements  since  our  acquisition  of  NYFIXMillennium  on February 1, 2002.  Gross  profit was also  adversely  affected byhigher data center costs to handle increased system demands.SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE        Selling,  general and administrative expense increased $17.7 million, or144% to $29.9 million for 2002,  from $12.2  million for 2001.  The increase wasprimarily  due to the  selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  for  ourrecently acquired NYFIX Millennium and Javelin  businesses and start-up expensesrelated to NYFIX Transaction  Services of $13.2 million,  and increased costs ofcorporate departments to support a larger organization,  of $4.5 million,  whichreflects  increased  salaries,  commissions  and  related  benefit  costs,  rentexpense,  and various office expenses due to an increase in personnel to supportour growth and acquisitions.  As a percentage of total revenue,  selling generaland  administrative  expense  increased to 53.5% in 2002 from 29.6% in 2001. Theincrease as a percentage of total revenue was attributable to increased  expenseto support our growth and acquisitions.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT        Research  and  development  expense  increased to $1.4 million for 2002,from $0.5 million for 2001,  primarily as a result of our continuing  efforts todevelop new products and services.  As a percentage of total  revenue,  researchand development expense was 2.5% for 2002 as compared to 1.1% for 2001.DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION        Depreciation and amortization  expense increased $3.5 million,  or 246%,to $4.9  million  for  2002,  from $1.4  million  for 2001.  This  increase  wasprimarily  attributable to the  depreciation  and  amortization  expense for ourrecently acquired NYFIX Millennium and Javelin businesses,  of $0.8 million, thecontinued  investment  in  our  infrastructure,  and to  administrative  support                                       38                                   NYFIX, INC.equipment and leasehold improvements to support our growth, of $1.1 million, andamortization  expense  related to our acquired  intangible  assets in connectionwith our recently  acquired  NYFIX  Millennium and Javelin  businesses,  of $1.6million. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization expensewas 8.7% for 2002 as compared to 3.4% for 2001.  The increase in  percentage  ofrevenue was primarily attributable to the impact of the aforementioned costs.INTEREST EXPENSE        Interest expense  decreased  $81,000,  or 24% to $262,000 for 2002, from$343,000  for 2001,  principally  as a result of decreased  interest  expense onloans due to the payoff of our line of credit  during July 2001 of $118,000  andlower interest paid on capital lease obligations of $33,000. Slightly offsettingthese amounts was interest  incurred in connection with late payments of certainobligations, of $70,000.INVESTMENT INCOME        Investment income decreased slightly to $0.7 million for 2002, from $0.8million for 2001, principally due to the combination of lower average investmentbalances   coupled  with  lower  yields  on  cash   equivalents  and  short-terminvestments in 2002 as compared to 2001.OTHER EXPENSE        Other expense increased  $607,000 to $621,000 for 2002, from $14,000 for2001,  principally  as a result of  losses  recognized  from our  unconsolidatedaffiliates of $474,000 for EuroLink and of $138,000 for Renaissance in 2002.INCOME TAX        We recorded an income tax benefit of $3.8 million for 2002,  compared toa provision  for income taxes of $5.4  million for 2001.  The income tax benefitwas  attributable  to our  pretax  loss in 2002 and  certain  Federal  and stateresearch and  development tax credits,  of $0.9 million,  available for researchand development expenses incurred during 1999 to 2002. Our effective tax benefitrate of 52% in the  current  year  exceeds the Federal  statutory  benefit  rateprimarily due to the effects of the aforementioned  research and development taxcredits and state income taxes.YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000REVENUE        Total  revenue  increased  $17.4  million,  or 73%, to $41.4 million for2001,  from $24.0  million for 2000,  primarily  due to  increased  demand amongexisting  subscription  customers,  the addition of new  customers,  new productofferings  sold to existing and new customers  and increased  demand for capitalsales of our derivatives products, offset slightly by lower hardware sales.        Subscription  revenue increased $13.0 million,  or 81%, to $29.0 millionfor 2001, from $16.0 million for 2000,  primarily due to increased  demand amongexisting subscription  customers,  the addition of new customers and new productofferings.  As a percentage of total revenue,  subscription revenue increased to70.0% in 2001  from  66.5% in  2000,  due to our  continued  effort  to  convertcustomers to a subscription-based revenue model.        Sale revenue  increased  $3.0 million,  or 60% to $8.1 million for 2001,from $5.1 million for 2000.  The increase in sale  revenue was  attributable  toincreased  customer demand for our OBMS product of $3.6 million,  offset in partby a decrease  in  hardware  sales of $0.6  million.  As a  percentage  of totalrevenue, sales revenue decreased to 19.6% in 2001, from 21.2% in 2000, primarily                                       39                                   NYFIX, INC.due to our efforts to convert customers to a  subscription-based  model and lessreliance on capital sales.        Service contract revenue increased $1.4 million, or 47%, to $4.3 millionfor  2001,  from  $2.9  million  in  2000,  due  primarily  to  an  increase  insubscription  revenue for our core  products.  As a percentage of total revenue,service  contract  revenue was 10.4% in 2001, as compared to 12.3% in 2000. Thisdecrease was primarily due to subscription  revenue increasing more than servicecontract  revenue.  Telecommunication  fees  revenue,  which is a  component  ofsubscription  revenue  but not  subject to  service  contracts,  increased  $2.0million.COST OF REVENUE        Total cost of revenue  increased $5.3 million,  or 59%, to $14.2 millionfor 2001,  from $8.9 million in 2000,  due  primarily  to increased  data centercosts, including telecommunication,  maintenance and rental expenses due to moredesktop connections and increased capacity in our data centers, of $2.3 million,increased  depreciation expense attributable to increased subscription equipmentleased to our customers and increased investment in our data center equipment tosupport our subscription  revenue components,  of $1.3 million,  increased laborcosts of $1.1 million, to support our subscription and service contract revenue,and increased amortization expense of product enhancement costs of $0.6 million,due to continued efforts to maintain competitive products.        Subscription  cost of revenue  increased $4.4 million,  or 59%, to $12.0million for 2001,  from $7.6 million for 2000,  primarily due to increased  datacenter costs, including  telecommunication,  maintenance and rental expenses dueto more desktop  connections and increased capacity in our data centers, of $1.8million,  increased  depreciation expense attributable to increased subscriptionequipment at our customers and increased investment in our data center equipmentto support our subscription revenue, of $1.3 million,  increased labor costs, of$0.9 million to support our  subscription  revenue,  and increased  amortizationexpense of  product  enhancement  costs due to  continued  efforts  to  maintaincompetitive  products, of $0.3 million. As a percentage of subscription revenue,subscription  cost of  revenue  decreased  to 41.5% in 2001 from  47.4% in 2000,primarily due to greater  increases in  subscription  revenue than  subscriptioncost of revenue.        Sale cost of revenue increased $0.2 million,  or 33% to $0.9 million for2001,  from $0.7  million  for 2000.  The  increase  in sale cost of  revenue isprimarily due to increased  amortization  expense for product enhancement costs.As a  percentage  of sale  revenue,  sale cost of revenue  decreased to 11.0% in2001,  from 13.2% in 2000,  primarily  due to greater  increases in sale revenuethan sale cost of revenue.        Service contract cost of revenue increased $0.5 million,  or 84% to $1.2million for 2001,  from $0.7 million for 2000.  The increase is primarily due toincreased  labor  costs to support our  customers.  As a  percentage  of servicecontract  revenue,  service contract cost of revenue increased to 28.7% in 2001,as compared to 23.0% in 2000.GROSS PROFIT        Gross  profit  increased  to 65.8% for 2001,  from  62.9% for 2000.  Theincrease in gross profit is primarily  attributable to more profitable  softwareinstallations  as  compared  to  equipment  installations,  offset  in  part  byincreased  communication  charges  relating to  increased  desktop  connections,higher  labor  costs due to  increased  data center  costs and service  contractrevenue, increased depreciation expense for subscription-based  equipment due toadditional  units being  placed into  service  and higher  amortization  expenserelated to product enhancement costs.        Subscription  gross profit  increased to 58.5% for 2001,  from 52.6% for2000.  The increase in  subscription  gross profit is  attributable  to softwarebeing a larger component of the installation as opposed to equipment,  which had                                       40                                   NYFIX, INC.a  higher  gross  profit,  offset  in part by  increased  communication  chargesrelating to increased desktop  connections,  higher labor costs due to increasedsubscription    contract   revenue,    increased    depreciation   expense   forsubscription-based  equipment due to additional  units being placed into serviceand  increased  purchases  and  leases  of  data  center  equipment  and  higheramortization expense related to product enhancement costs.        Sale gross profit  increased  slightly to 89.0% for 2001, from 86.8% for2000. The increase in sale gross profit is primarily attributable to the sale ofmore profitable software, primarily our OBMS product.        Service  contract gross profit  decreased to 71.3% for 2001,  from 77.0%for  2000.   The  decrease  in  service   contract  gross  profit  is  primarilyattributable to higher costs of labor to service our products.SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE        Selling,  general and administrative  expense increased $4.6 million, or61% to $12.2  million for 2001,  from $7.6  million for 2000.  The  increase wasprimarily due to increased  salaries and commissions,  related  personnel costs,rent expense and various office  expenses to support an increase in employees of24% in 2001 from 2000 to support our growth.  As a percentage of total  revenue,selling general and administrative expense decreased to 29.6% in 2001 from 31.6%in 2000.  The decrease as a percentage  of total revenue was  attributable  to agreater increase in revenue as compared to the increased  expense to support ourgrowth and acquisitions.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT        Research and  development  expense of $0.5 million for 2001 was constantwith the $0.5 million for 2000. As a percentage of total  revenue,  research anddevelopment  expense  was 1.1% for 2001 as  compared to 1.9% for 2000 as revenueincreased for 2001 while research and development expense remained constant.DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION        Depreciation and amortization  expense increased $0.8 million,  or 149%,to $1.4  million  for  2001,  from $0.6  million  for 2000.  This  increase  wasprimarily  attributable  to  additional  investment  in  administrative  supportequipment and leasehold  improvements to support our growth.  As a percentage oftotal  revenue,  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  was  3.4% for 2001 ascompared to 2.4% for 2000.  The increase in  percentage of revenue was primarilyattributable to the impact of the aforementioned costs.INTEREST EXPENSE        Interest  expense of $0.3  million for 2001 was  constant  with the $0.3million for 2000, as we had increased  interest on capital lease  obligations of$0.1 million,  offset by a decrease in loan interest expense of $0.1 million dueto the payoff of our line of credit during July 2001.INVESTMENT INCOME        Investment  income increased to $0.8 million for 2001, from $0.2 millionfor 2000,  principally due to the higher average investment balances as a resultof the proceeds from our offering of common stock in June 2001.INCOME TAX        Our income tax  provision  increased to $5.4 million in 2001 as comparedto $0.6  million  for  2000.  The  increase  in our  income  tax  provision  wasattributable  to an increase in our pretax  income in 2001.  Our  effective  tax                                       41                                   NYFIX, INC.provision rate of 40% in 2001 reflects the combined Federal statutory income taxrate and state income taxes. The effective income tax provision rate of 9.6% for2000 was lower than the Federal  statutory  tax rate as a result of the reversalof  valuation  allowances  as we believed  that we would  realize the benefit ofprior income tax net operating  losses and other  temporary  differences,  whichresulted in the previously established valuation allowance.EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11TH        The events of September 11, 2001, did not have a material  effect on ourfinancial position,  results of operations, or cash flows. We believe that theseevents did not affect our  overall  growth  outlook.  We  credited  the  ongoinginvestment  in  state-of-the-art  redundant  data centers and our NYFIX  Networkinfrastructure for our ability to maintain 100% effective  operations across allproducts  and  services  throughout  the  month of  September  2001.  While  ouremployees  worked  around the clock to assist many clients in recovery  testing,and in some cases establishing  temporary emergency operations,  we opted not tocharge any customers one-time fees in connection with these efforts. We also didnot incur any significant  incremental  expense in connection with the events ofSeptember 11, 2001.        Although  the events of  September  11, 2001 did not have a  significanteffect  on our  results  of  operations,  they  did  have  an  effect  on  NYFIXMillennium,  which we had a 50%  ownership  interest  in,  at that  time.  Afterroll-out  efforts  were  temporarily  stalled by the tragic  events of September11th,  NYFIX  Millennium  usage  increased  later in the fourth quarter of 2001,bringing the system back to initial execution levels.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES        In June 2001, we raised $57.3 million, net of expenses, from a follow-onpublic  offering of 3 million  shares of our common stock.  We used a portion ofthe net proceeds for working  capital  requirements,  to re-purchase 1.3 millionshares of our common  stock,  to  continue to invest in our  infrastructure  andproducts and,  subsequently,  to acquire  Javelin in March of 2002 and invest inEuroLink and  Renaissance.  At December 31, 2002, our cash, cash equivalents andshort-term  investments  totaled  $21.9  million as compared to $33.9 million atDecember 31, 2001. We had  investments  of $10.7  million in current  marketablesecurity  instruments,  having  interest  rates ranging from 1.2% to 3.5%,  $0.6million in a tax-free  money fund with an average 30 day yield of 0.55% and $6.3million in money market funds with an average 30 day yield of 1.1%,  at December31, 2002.        At  December  31,  2002,  we had  total  debt  of  $1.8  million,  whichrepresented  current and  long-term  amounts  outstanding  under  capital  leaseobligations.  At December 31, 2002, we had no material  commitments  for capitalexpenditures  or inventory  purchases.  Our  long-term  capital  needs depend onnumerous factors,  including the rate we obtain new clients and expand our staffand  infrastructure,  as needed, to accommodate such growth, as well as the rateat which we choose to invest in new technologies to modify our NYFIX Network andinfrastructure. We have ongoing needs for capital, including working capital foroperations and capital expenditures to maintain and expand our operations.        We believe  that we can achieve  synergies  from our  recently  acquiredNYFIX Millennium and Javelin businesses.  Although our NYFIX Millennium businesshas incurred losses through its development and start-up stages, we believe thatrevenue will  continue to increase as we gain greater  acceptance of our productofferings.  However,  we expect NYFIX  Millennium  to possibly  need  additionalworking  capital during the first six to nine months of 2003,  until it achievespositive cash flow from  operations.  Our strategy is to migrate Javelin to moreof a  subscription-based  revenue model, similar to our core NYFIX USA business.This  may  cause  Javelin   capital  sale  revenue  to  be   unpredictable   andinconsistent.  As such, this too, may unfavorably impact our working capital. Inaddition, our unconsolidated affiliates, Renaissance and EuroLink, have required                                       42                                   NYFIX, INC.$3.1  million  in funding  from us in the past.  We may be  required  to provideadditional  funding to them,  until they  generate  positive cash flow or obtainother sources of capital. Such additional funding, if required,  may unfavorablyimpact our working capital.        We believe that our cash and investments of $21.9 million, together withanticipated  cash to be generated from  operations will be sufficient to supportour  capital  and  operating  needs,  including  the  operating  needs  of NYFIXMillennium and Javelin for at least the next twelve months.        The following  summarizes our contractual  obligations under capital andoperating  leases at December  31,  2002,  and the effect such  obligations  areexpected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:                                      Capital       Operating         Total                                      -------        -------        -------Year ending December 31,                          (in thousands)- -----------------------   2003                               $ 1,161        $ 4,983        $ 6,144   2004                                   551          4,898          5,449   2005                                   136          2,224          2,360   2006                                    --            786            786   2007                                    --            820            820   Thereafter                              --          2,030          2,030                                      -------        -------        -------   Total minimum lease payments       $ 1,848        $15,741        $17,589                                      =======        =======        =======WORKING CAPITAL        At  December  31,  2002,  we had  working  capital  of $30.8  million ascompared to $47.5 million at December 31, 2001.  Our present  capital  resourcesinclude proceeds from internal  operations.  The decrease in working capital wasprincipally  due to the cash used to acquire  Javelin  and invest in and provideloans and working capital advances to our  unconsolidated  affiliates,  EuroLinkand Renaissance.CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES        Net cash provided by operating  activities in 2002 was $4.1 million,  asour net loss of $3.2 million, adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation,amortization,  deferred  taxes,  provision  for  bad  debts,  equity  in loss ofunconsolidated   affiliates  and  minority   interest   provided  $7.4  million.Unfavorable  working  capital  changes  offset by other  changes,  net of assetsacquired and liabilities assumed from our recently acquired NYFIX Millennium andJavelin businesses, decreased cash by $3.3 million.        Net cash provided by operating  activities in 2001 was $10.6 million, asour  net  income  of  $8.1  million,   adjusted  for  non-cash  items,  such  asdepreciation,  amortization, deferred taxes and provision for bad debts provided$16.3 million.  Unfavorable  working  capital offset by other changes  decreasedcash by $5.7 million.CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES        The 2002 cash provided by investing  activities  was $2.8 million.  Thisconsisted  primarily of net proceeds  from the sales and purchases of short-terminvestments of $22.4 million, offset by payments for our recently acquired NYFIXMillennium  and  Javelin  businesses,  net of cash  acquired,  of $6.8  million,investments  in and net advances to  unconsolidated  affiliates of $5.4 million,capital  expenditures,  mostly for data center  equipment and software,  of $4.6                                       43                                   NYFIX, INC.million and product enhancement costs of $2.8 million.        The 2001 cash used in  investing  activities  was  $48.1  million.  Thisconsisted primarily of net purchases of short-term  investments of $29.0 millionusing the proceeds  from our  follow-on  offering,  loans and net advances to anunconsolidated affiliate of $9.2 million, capital expenditures,  mostly for datacenter equipment and to support our infrastructure,  of $7.1 million and productenhancement costs of $2.7 million.CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES        In 2002, our net cash used in financing activities totaled $0.7 million,consisting  primarily of principal  payments under capital lease  obligations of$1.2  million,  offset by net  proceeds  from the  exercise of stock  options byemployees of $0.5 million.        In 2001,  our net cash  provided by financing  activities  totaled $37.6million,  consisting primarily of $57.3 million raised in our follow on offeringand $2.2 million  provided by net proceeds from the exercise of stock options byemployees, offset by purchases of treasury stock of $19.1 million, repayments ofborrowings  under our credit  facility of $2.0  million and  principal  paymentsunder capital lease obligations of $0.8 million.SEASONALITY AND INFLATION        We believe that our operations have not been  significantly  affected byseasonality or inflation.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        In October  2001,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")issued SFAS No. 144,  ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS,  whichsupercedes SFAS No. 121,  ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS ANDFOR  LONG-LIVED  ASSETS TO BE  DISPOSED  OF, and the  accounting  and  reportingprovisions of Accounting  Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 30, REPORTING THERESULTS OF  OPERATIONS  -  REPORTING  THE  EFFECTS OF DISPOSAL OF A SEGMENT OF ABUSINESS,  AND  EXTRAORDINARY,  UNUSUAL AND  INFREQUENTLY  OCCURRING  EVENTS ANDTRANSACTIONS,  for the disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS No. 144 retainsmany of the  provisions  of SFAS No. 121, but addresses  certain  implementationissues  associated  with that  Statement.  SFAS No. 144 is effective  for fiscalyears  beginning  after  December  15, 2001.  We adopted SFAS No. 144  effectiveJanuary 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material  effect onour financial position, results of operations or cash flows.        In  April  2002,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS No.  145,  RESCISSION  OF FASBSTATEMENTS  NO. 4, 44 AND 64,  AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 13, AND TECHNICALCORRECTIONS.  SFAS No. 145  eliminates  extraordinary  accounting  treatment forreporting  gains or losses on debt  extinguishment,  and amends  other  existingauthoritative  pronouncements to make various technical corrections.  We adoptedSFAS No. 145  effective  January 1, 2003.  The  adoption of SFAS No. 145 did nothave a material effect on our financial position,  results of operations or cashflows.        In July 2002,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No.  146,  ACCOUNTING  FOR EXIT ORDISPOSAL ACTIVITIES.  SFAS No. 146 requires recording costs associated with exitor disposal  activities at their fair values when a liability has been incurred.Under  previous  guidance,  certain exit costs were  accrued  upon  management'scommitment  to an exit plan.  The  provisions  of SFAS No. 146 are effective forexit or disposal activities  initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not expectthat  adoption  of SFAS No.  146 will have a  material  effect on our  financialposition, results of operations or cash flows.        In November 2002, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached aconsensus  on No.  00-21,  ACCOUNTING  FOR REVENUE  ARRANGEMENTS  WITH  MULTIPLEDELIVERABLES.   EITF  No.  00-21  applies  to  certain   contractually   binding                                       44                                   NYFIX, INC.arrangements   under  which  a  company  performs  multiple  revenue  generatingactivities  and requires that all companies  account for each element  within anarrangement  with multiple  deliverables  as separate units of accounting if (a)the delivered item has value on a stand-alone  basis, (b) there is objective andreliable  evidence  of fair  value and (c) the  amount of the total  arrangementconsideration  is fixed.  EITF No. 00-21 is effective  for revenue  arrangementsentered into in fiscal periods  beginning after June 15, 2003. We are evaluatingthe  provisions  of EITF  No.  00-21  and  whether  the  implementation  of thisstatement  will have a material  effect on our  financial  position,  results ofoperations or cash flows.        In  November  2002,  the FASB  issued  FASB  Interpretation  ("FIN") 45,GUARANTOR'S  ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE  REQUIREMENTS  FOR GUARANTEES,  INCLUDINGINDIRECT  GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS.  FIN 45 disclosure  requirementsare  effective  for the year ended  December 31, 2002 and other  provisions  areeffective for 2003. The interpretation  requires additional  disclosure relatingto guarantees and in some cases requires the  recognition of a liability for thefair value of certain guarantees. The adoption of FIN 45 had no effect on us, aswe do not guarantee the liabilities of others.        In  December  2002,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  148,  ACCOUNTING  FORSTOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION - TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE.  SFAS No. 148 amends SFASNo. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, to provide alternative methodsof transition  for  companies  that  voluntarily  change to the fair value basedmethod of accounting for stock-based  employee  compensation.  SFAS No. 148 alsoamends  the  disclosure  provisions  of SFAS  No.  123 and APB No.  28,  INTERIMFINANCIAL  REPORTING,  to  require  disclosure  in the  summary  of  significantaccounting policies of the effects of an entity's accounting policy with respectto stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and income per sharein annual and interim financial  statements.  The disclosure  provisions of SFASNo. 148 are effective for both interim and annual  periods ending after December15, 2002. We have adopted the disclosure  provisions of SFAS No. 148 at December31, 2002.        In January  2003,  the FASB  issued FIN 46,  CONSOLIDATION  OF  VARIABLEINTEREST  ENTITIES,   which  requires  the  consolidation  of  certain  entitiesconsidered to be variable interest entities ("VIEs"). An entity is considered tobe a VIE  when it has  equity  investors  which  lack the  characteristics  of acontrolling  financial interest,  or its capital is insufficient to permit it tofinance  its  activities  without  additional  subordinated  financial  support.Consolidation of a VIE by an investor is required when it is determined that theinvestor will absorb a majority of the VIE's expected losses or residual returnsif they occur.  FIN 46 provides  certain  exceptions  to these rules,  includingqualifying special purpose entities subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 140,ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL  ASSETS AND  EXTINGUISHMENTSOF  LIABILITIES.  VIEs  created  after  January  31,  2003 must be  consolidatedimmediately,  while  VIEs  that  existed  prior  to  February  1,  2003  must beconsolidated  as of July 1, 2003. We are evaluating the provisions of FIN 46 andwhether the implementation of this statement,  with regard to our unconsolidatedaffiliates,  will have a material effect on our financial  position,  results ofoperations or cash flows.FACTORS AFFECTING OPERATING RESULTSSOME  OF  OUR  RECENTLY-ACQUIRED  SUBSIDIARIES  HAVE  NOT  BEEN  PROFITABLE  ANDTHEREFORE WE MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE.        In December 2001, we acquired an inactive  broker-dealer  and renamed itNYFIX  Transaction  Services,   Inc.  In  May  2002,  the  NASD  approved  NYFIXTransaction  Services'  membership  application and it first started  generatingrevenues  as of July 1,  2002.  Through  its  first  year of  operations,  NYFIXTransaction Services had incurred a net loss of $0.8 million. Although we expectNYFIX Transaction Services to start to generate positive cash flows during 2003,we can provide no  assurances of our success in doing such.  Accordingly,  NYFIXTransaction  Services may need us to provide the  necessary  capital to maintaintheir minimum capital requirements, thus impacting our working capital.                                       45                                   NYFIX, INC.        Effective as of February 1, 2002, we increased our ownership interest inNYFIX  Millennium from 50% to 80%. NYFIX Millennium was formed in September 1999and since  that time has been in the  development  and  start-up  stages and hasincurred  aggregate  net losses of $28.0  million  through  December  31,  2002.Although we expect NYFIX  Millennium  to start to generate  positive  cash flowstowards the latter half of 2003,  we can provide no assurances of our success indoing such.  Accordingly,  NYFIX Millennium may need us to provide the necessarycapital to maintain  their  minimum  capital  requirements,  thus  impacting ourworking capital.        Effective as of March 31, 2002, we acquired  Javelin.  Javelin  incurrednet losses of $1.8 million, $6.7 million and $2.0 million for the years 2000 and2001 and the three months ended March 31, 2002,  respectively.  Although Javelinresults are not reported separately, Javelin continued to incur operating lossesuntil the fourth  quarter of 2002.  We believe that our  synergies  with Javelinwill enhance our overall operating results.  However,  our strategy to apply oursubscription-based  model to  Javelin's  products,  where  feasible,  may not besuccessful.  Javelin's business is heavily  concentrated  towards capital sales,which are very unpredictable and inconsistent.  Transitioning Javelin to more ofa subscription-based model could have an adverse impact on our working capital.A NUMBER OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES  HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING  HISTORY,  WHICH MAKES ITDIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THEIR PROSPECTS, SO THEIR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAYDISAPPOINT SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS AND RESULT IN A DECLINE IN OUR STOCKPRICE.        NYFIX  Millennium and Javelin were formed in September 1999 and November1997,  respectively.  Also, we purchased NYFIX Transaction  Services in December2001.  Because of their limited operating  history,  these entities have limitedfinancial data,  which can be used to evaluate their  businesses.  Considerationmust be given to their  prospects  in  light  of the  risks,  expenses,  delays,problems and difficulties  frequently  encountered in the establishment of a newbusiness in an emerging and rapidly evolving industry. NYFIX Millennium, Javelinand NYFIX Transaction  Services may not be successful in their  businesses,  andprofitability may never be attained or sustained.WE HAVE TWO UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES,  WHICH MAY NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROMUS, THUS HAVING AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY.        We have provided funding to our unconsolidated  affiliates,  Renaissanceand EuroLink,  in the past. In our balance sheet,  at December 31, 2002, we haveamounts due and notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates of $3.1 million.We provided  Renaissance an additional $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2003in exchange for a secured  promissory note.  Renaissance may require  additionalfunds from us, until they generate positive cash flow or obtain other sources ofcapital.  We cannot  provide  assurance  that  additional  interim  funding,  ifrequired, won't have an adverse impact on our liquidity.A  SIGNIFICANT  POWER  AND  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  FAILURE  COULD  CAUSE US TO LOSEREVENUES AND CUSTOMERS AND SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY FOR CUSTOMER LOSSES.        Our  services  depend on our  ability to store,  retrieve,  process  andmanage  significant  databases and to  electronically  receive and process tradeorders. Our systems and data centers could fail due to power failures, caused bya variety of factors, or outages,  caused by high demand placed on the utility'sinfrastructure.  Due to the complexity of these  electrical  systems,  errors orfailures could occur which render an entire site to be unusable.        We constantly  monitor  system loads and  performances  and as necessaryupgrade our systems to handle estimated increases in power consumption. However,we may not be able to accurately  predict future demand.  To mitigate the impactof power failures,  we maintain  critical data center facilities at two separatelocations in North Bergen, New Jersey and Carlstadt,  New Jersey. Although thesedata centers are serviced by the same  utility,  they are serviced via differentsub-stations.  In the  event of a power  outage at any of our data  centers,  wemaintain  uninterruptible  power  supplies  ("UPS") to provide  limited  batterybackup for critical  systems.  We also  maintain  diesel-powered  generators  tobackup the UPSs.                                       46                                   NYFIX, INC.        In the event of loss of power or  telecommunications  services at eitherof these locations,  we believe there are sufficient  backup facilities in placeto give us the necessary  time to access,  or fail-over  to, our redundant  datacenter.  It is  possible  that  multiple  telecommunications  vendors  could  beimpacted so severely that the  multi-vendor  and  multi-site  strategy would notinsure communications services to our clients.        Since it is  fairly  common  for  multiple  carriers  to share  the samephysical  infrastructure  such as Central  Offices  (CO's),  telephone poles andbelow-ground  conduit,  instances  like  major  cable cuts or  regional  naturaldisasters could adversely impact our clients and us.ANY  INFILTRATION  OF  HARMFUL  VIRUSES  COULD  CAUSE  US TO LOSE  REVENUES  ANDCUSTOMERS AND SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY FOR CUSTOMER LOSSES.        We utilize  multiple  methods to combat viruses.  The first method is toprevent  viruses from entering our NYFIX Network.  This is done by placing rigidrestrictions on our NYFIX Network called access controls lists ("ACL"). ACLs areused where clients or vendors  connect to our NYFIX Network.  A second method ofpreventing  viruses from entering our NYFIX  Network is the use of firewalls.  Afirewall  typically guards an internal network against malicious access from theoutside;  however,  firewalls  may also be  configured  to limit  access  to theoutside from internal users. In spite of the ACLs and firewalls, it may still bepossible for viruses to enter our NYFIX Network.        If a virus is still  able to  penetrate  our NYFIX  Network,  we utilizecentrally managed anti-virus scanning software on servers and workstations.  Ouranti-virus  software actively scans servers and workstations on the network.  Inspite of the active  anti-virus  scanning,  it is possible for a virus to not bedetected.        As  an  additional  method  to  combat  viruses,  we  utilize  intrusiondetection  software ("IDS").  IDS servers and software are located at key pointsaround the network and monitor systems for malicious activity.WE  RELY  ON  MULTIPLE   TELECOMMUNICATIONS  CARRIERS  FOR  DATA  DELIVERY.  ANYDISRUPTIONS  TO THESE  SERVICES  COULD  HAVE A  MATERIAL  ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OURBUSINESS.        We utilize frame relay network services from five major carriers:  AT&T,Qwest, Sprint, WorldCom and Verizon. Customers are given the choice of using oneor more  network  carriers  to provide  network  services to their  location.  Amajority of NYFIX clients utilize a dual carrier solution.        The utilization of five major carriers has multiple benefits:     o    Diversity  of  telecommunication   infrastructure  between  the  major          carriers     o    A  competitive  environment  to help  insure  aggressive  pricing  for          network services     o    The ability to completely migrate circuits from one carrier to another          due to  non-competitive  pricing  or a  carrier  no  longer  providing          adequate services.        In the event that a major carrier was to shut down their network with noadvance warning (e.g.  WorldCom),  it would take at least 45 days to replace thecircuits  with  another  vendor.  In the  event of a move  from one  carrier  toanother,  we would incur  substantial  expenses related to the cost of utilizingtwo  carriers  for the  same  period  of  time.  We could  also be  impacted  byexclusivity  agreements  between carriers and connecting  points on the network.For example,  WorldCom is the sole provider of network  services for NASDAQ.  Inthe event WorldCom discontinued  operations,  we would incur costs transitioningto a new NASDAQ network service provider.                                       47                                   NYFIX, INC.        The  approximate  time  necessary  for the transfer of circuits from onecarrier to the other would be four to six weeks.  During the transfer,  we wouldincur  overlapping  circuit charges for a minimum of thirty days.  These chargesare due to a  thirty  day  delay  that  begins  when  the  original  circuit  isdisconnected, therefore, the minimum cost of moving business from one carrier toanother would be at least one months worth of charges from the original carrier.WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL  COMPETITION IN OUR INDIVIDUAL  PRODUCT AREAS FROM COMPANIESTHAT HAVE LARGER AND GREATER  FINANCIAL,  TECHNICAL AND MARKETING  CAPABILITIES,WHICH  COULD MAKE IT MORE  DIFFICULT  TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN  MARKET  SHARE AND MAYHINDER OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY.        We operate in a highly  competitive  market  and expect  competition  tointensify in the future.  Certain of our  competitors,  including  the financialexchanges,  may have significantly  greater  financial,  technical and marketingresources  and more  extensive  customer  bases and  extensive  knowledge of theindustry.        Our industry is constantly evolving through technological and regulatorychange. Our competition varies widely and we encounter  different  categories ofcompetitors  for  each of our  product  and  service  offerings.  We  also  facecompetition from customers who choose to maintain their own  infrastructure  anddevelop their own in-house proprietary order management software systems.OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES  AND GROW OUR BUSINESS  COULD BESIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF KEY PERSONNEL.        Our business is highly dependent on a number of key executive  officers,including Peter K. Hansen,  our founder,  Chief Executive Officer and President,and Lars Kragh, our Chief Information  Officer,  who have been with us since ourinception in 1991.  The loss of the services of any of our key  personnel  couldhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.WE RELY, IN PART,  ON OTHERS TO SUPPLY THE  MATERIALS  AND SUPPLIES,  UNDERLYINGSOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS WE USE TO PROVIDE OUR SERVICES.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAINTHIRD PARTY SUPPORT AND DELIVERY ON A TIMELY AND RELIABLE BASIS,  OUR ABILITY TOPERFORM  SERVICES  COULD BE  HINDERED  AND THE  RELATIONSHIPS  WE HAVE  WITH OURCUSTOMERS COULD BE HARMED.        Our  manufactured  products are based on standard PC components  readilyavailable  in the  consumer  market  place.  All  electronic,  computer-relatedcomponents  utilized  within  our  products  are not  manufacturer  or  supplierspecific.  We can substitute  components  from a diverse group of  manufacturerswith no assembly or delivery delays to our customers.                                       48                                   NYFIX, INC.        However, our manufactured products contain several custom parts specificto our design.  These parts are limited to sheet metal  enclosures  and internalwiring.  We own the  designs  for  these  components  and can  source  them frommultiple  vendors in our  immediate  area or  throughout  the U.S.  Currently wemaintain  relationships  with a minimum of two alternate vendors for cabling andsheet metal,  either of which can deliver  components  within standard  deliverycycles. For both of these components we use vendors such as CTC, Advantage SheetMetal and Interface Technology. Although we maintain relationships with numerousvendors for our  manufactured  products,  if we are unable to obtain third partydelivery and support on a timely and reliable basis,  our ability to provide ourproduct and services could be hindered.        We rely on a number of third parties to supply software and systems,  aswell as equipment and related maintenance.  Our systems are built using a numberof commonly used technologies. As an example, we use systems from EMC, Sun MicroSystems,  Oracle,  Sybase,  Veritas and  Microsoft.  Our products are subject topotential defects in these third party  components.  Although we (as well as theindividual  vendors)  exercise  strict testing and  verification  of systems andsoftware, defects can cause disruptions of customer service. We have invested invarious  test  systems to make sure  supplier's  components  work as well as ourdeveloped software.        Since we depend on third parties to supply us with  underlying  softwareand systems on a reliable,  timely basis,  we maintain  service and  maintenanceagreements  with all our main vendors.  We have standard  service  agreements atdifferent  levels,  depending  on how  critical  the  vendor's  system is to theoperation of our business.  For most systems we have a high level of redundancy,which gives us less time  critical  dependency on a particular  vendor.  We haveservice and maintenance agreements with all above-mentioned  vendors. Because ofthe diversity in vendors, there is no dependence on a single vendor. However, ifwe are  unable to obtain  third  party  support  and  delivery  on a timely  andreliable  basis,  our  ability to perform  services  could be  hindered  and therelationships we have with our customers could be harmed.OUR PRODUCTS MAY SUFFER FROM DEFECTS OR ERRORS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR REPUTATION ORSUBJECT US TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS.        The  products  we offer are  inherently  complex.  Despite  testing  andquality control,  current versions, new versions or enhancements of our productsmay contain errors. Any errors, slowdown or failure in our products may harm ourreputation  or subject us to product  liability  claims.  Significant  technicalchallenges  also arise with our  products  because our  customers  purchase  andintegrate them with a number of third party computer  applications and software.Such  integration  may not always be successful.  Any defects or errors that arediscovered after commercial release could result in the loss of revenue or delayin market acceptance of our products. Moreover, we could face higher developmentcosts  if our  products  contain  undetected  errors,  or if we fail to meet ourcustomers'  expectations.  Although  we  maintain  general  liability  insurancecoverage,  this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms orat all. In addition, a product liability claim, whether or not successful, couldharm our business by increasing our costs and distracting our management.WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT  OUR  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  RIGHTS,  WHICH COULDWEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND INCREASE OUR COSTS.        Our success and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degreeon our intellectual property rights, which includes our proprietary  technology,trade secrets and client base. However,  no one patent,  trademark or other formof intellectual property rights is critical to our business.        Despite  our  efforts to protect our  proprietary  rights,  unauthorizedparties  may  attempt  to copy or  otherwise  obtain  and  use our  products  ortechnology.  Monitoring  unauthorized  use of our products is  difficult  and we                                       49                                   NYFIX, INC.cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent  unauthorized use ofour technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protectour  proprietary  rights as fully as in the U.S. If competitors  are able to useour technology,  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.  Litigationmay be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual  property rights,  toprotect  our  trade  secrets,  to  determine  the  validity  and  scope  of  theproprietary  rights of others,  or to defend against claims of  infringement  orinvalidity.  Litigation,  whether or not successful, could result in substantialcosts and diversions of resources.        We may in the future receive  notices of claims of infringement of otherparties' proprietary rights. We cannot assure you that claims of infringement orinvalidity,  or claims for indemnification  resulting from infringement  claims,will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. Any such claims,  with or withoutmerit, could be time consuming to defend,  result in costly  litigation,  divertmanagement's  attention  and  resources  or require us to enter into  royalty orlicensing  agreements.  We cannot  assure you that these  royalties  or licenseswould be available on reasonable terms, if at all.CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS SUBJECTS US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS.        For the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, approximately 11%,15% and 5%,  respectively,  of our revenue was  derived  from our  internationaloperations.  Although we have recently relied less on international  revenue, webelieve it will be an important  component for our future success.  Thus, we aresubject to risks inherent in doing business in international markets, including:     o    difficulties  in  recruiting  and  retaining  personnel  and  managing          international operations;     o    a high degree of costs  associated  with  servicing  smaller  national          markets; and     o    fluctuations in currency exchange rates.        Any of the above could  affect the  profitability  of our  internationaloperations or hinder our ability to expand further internationally.A DECLINE IN SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE, OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE, OR TRANSACTIONREVENUE WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.        Subscription   revenue  is  our  most  significant  source  of  revenue.Subscription  revenue is fixed based on a contractual period of time,  typicallyone to three years,  and are not affected by trading volumes.  However,  tradingvolumes do affect the  revenues of our  customers  and this could  affect  theirfuture  purchases of our  technology  and  services.  Pricing  pressures  due tocompetition, failure to sign new agreements with customers because of reductionsin their new technology  spending,  and observed  consolidation in the financialsector could affect our revenues and  profitability.  Our costs  associated withsupporting the  subscription  agreements are generally  fixed and thus a loss ofrevenue would impact profitability.        Transaction  revenue  has  been a  growing  component  of  our  revenue,however,  there is no assurance we can continue to grow transaction  revenue. Asour costs to support  transaction  revenue  are  generally  fixed,  a decline inrevenue would directly impact our  profitability.  Several risk factors apply tothe analysis of the potential growth of transaction revenue.        There is significant  competitive pressure brought on by a proliferationof electronic execution  competitors.  There is the potential for changes in thecurrent U.S.  Market  Structure  that may make it difficult for the  transactionbusiness to compete with more traditional  broker-dealer  business  models.  Forexample, the NYSE could establish limits on electronic access, or the NYSE couldcreate an electronic matching order engine of their own.        Customer   demands  for  increased   bandwidth  and  speed  could  placesignificant stress on our  infrastructure  requiring  continued  reinvestment in                                       50                                   NYFIX, INC.hardware  and  software to keep pace with overall  business  growth.  We have nocurrent plans to transition from the subscription or  transaction-based  revenuemodel due to general  acceptance of it in the  marketplace and the current trendof recurring, predictable revenue recognition and cash flows.THE SECURITIES BROKERAGE INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.IF NYFIX  MILLENNIUM  OR NYFIX  TRANSACTION  SERVICES  FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESEREGULATIONS,  THEY MAY BE SUBJECT TO  DISCIPLINARY OR OTHER ACTION BY REGULATORYORGANIZATIONS.        We are subject to extensive government  regulation and may be subject todisciplinary  or other action by regulatory  organizations  if we fail to complywith such regulation, which could increase our capital expenditures and decreaseour earnings.        NYFIX Millennium and NYFIX Transaction Services are subject to extensiveregulation under both federal and state laws. In addition to these laws, we mustcomply with rules of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC),  includingRegulation ATS for NYFIX Millennium,  and The National Association of SecuritiesDealers, Inc. (NASD), various stock exchanges,  state securities commissions andother  regulatory   bodies  charged  with  safeguarding  the  integrity  of  thesecurities  markets and other financial  markets and protecting the interests ofinvestors  participating in these markets.  As registered broker dealers,  NYFIXMillennium and NYFIX  Transaction  Services are subject to numerous  regulationscovering the securities business, including:     o    marketing practices;     o    capital structure, including net capital requirements;     o    record keeping; and     o    conduct of directors, officers and employees.        Any  failure  to comply  with  these  regulations  could  subject  NYFIXMillennium and NYFIX  Transaction  Services to censure,  fines,  the issuance ofcease-and-desist  orders  or  the  suspension,  and/or  disqualification  of itsofficers,  directors or employees. The fines, if material, could have an adverseeffect  on  our  earnings   because  it  could  greatly   increase  our  capitalexpenditures.  If any of our employees were suspended or disqualified, we may beunable to meet the needs of our clients or to solicit new  business.  This couldalso have an adverse  effect on our earnings.  Furthermore,  any such  penaltiescould  materially  harm our  reputation  in the  industry,  which  could  have along-term effect on our financial growth.NYFIX  MILLENNIUM'S  AND  NYFIX  TRANSACTION   SERVICES'   COMPLIANCE  AND  RISKMANAGEMENT METHODS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.        NYFIX  Millennium's and NYFIX  Transaction  Services'  ability to complywith  regulations  depends  largely on the  establishment  and maintenance of aneffective  compliance  system,  as well as their  ability to attract  and retainqualified compliance personnel.  NYFIX Millennium and NYFIX Transaction Servicescould be subject to disciplinary  or other actions due to claimed  noncompliancewith  regulations  in the  future.  If a  claim  of  noncompliance  is made by aregulatory  authority,  the efforts of the  management of NYFIX  Millennium  andNYFIX  Transaction  Services  could be diverted to  responding to such claim andNYFIX Millennium and NYFIX  Transaction  Services could be subject to a range ofpossible  consequences,  including the payment of fines,  civil lawsuits and thesuspension of one or more portions of its business.  In addition,  their mode ofoperation and profitability may be directly affected by:     o    additional legislation;     o    changes  in rules  promulgated  by the SEC,  the  NASD,  the  Board of          Governors of the Federal Reserve  System,  the various stock exchanges          or other self-regulatory organizations; or                                       51                                   NYFIX, INC.     o    changes in the  interpretation  or  enforcement  of existing  laws and          rules.        In addition, NYFIX Millennium's status as a recognized ATS requires thatits trade  execution  and  communication  systems be able to handle  anticipatedpresent and future peak trading volumes.  If any of our systems become disabled,the  ability  to  process  trades  and  handle  peak  trading  volumes  will  becompromised.  The status of NYFIX Millennium as an SEC registered  broker-dealerand NASD member is  conditioned,  in part,  on its ability to process and settletrades.TERRORIST  THREATS  AND  ATTACKS  AND THE  IRAQI  WAR HAVE  CREATED  SIGNIFICANTINSTABILITY  AND  UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL  MARKETPLACE TO WHICH WE SELL ANDMAY CREATE A MORE VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT.        The terrorist attacks in the U.S. on September 11, 2001, the declarationof war by the U.S.  against  terrorism  and the current war in Iraq have createdsignificant  instability and uncertainty in the financial  marketplace,  both inthe U.S.  and  globally.  Such  adverse  political  events may have a  continuednegative  impact on economic  conditions  in the financial  marketplace  and ourcustomers.  The  unfavorable  conditions  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on ourfinancial  operations  including,  but not limited to, our ability to expand themarket for our products,  enter into  strategic  relationships  and  effectivelycompete.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        Market risk  generally  represents the risk of loss that may be expectedto result  from the  potential  change in value of a financial  instrument  as aresult of fluctuations in credit ratings of the issuer, equity prices,  interestrates or foreign  currency  exchange rates.  We do not use derivative  financialinstruments for any purpose.        We are exposed to market risk  principally  through  changes in interestrates and equity prices.  Our short-term  investment  portfolio of $10.7 millionand $29.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, consisted of $6.8million and $9.0 million,  respectively,  of auction rate  certificates and $3.9million and $20.0  million,  respectively,  of mutual fund  securities.  Risk islimited on the auction rate  certificates  portfolio  due to the fact that it isinvested in insured  municipal  bonds of which no more than 5% of our  portfoliocan be invested in any one security issue. The potential  decrease in fair valueresulting from a hypothetical  10% change in interest rates for the auction ratecertificates would not be material to income, cash flows or fair value.        The mutual fund securities  portfolio was invested in a quoted fund thatis  managed by an  institution  which  primarily  invests  in  investment  gradesecurities,  with up to a maximum of 10% invested in high yield securities ratedB or higher.  These  securities  are subject to equity price risk. The estimatedpotential loss in fair value  resulting from a hypothetical  10% decrease in thequoted price is $0.4 million.        We are also  subject to interest  rate risk on our $2.0 million of notesreceivable from  unconsolidated  affiliates at December 31, 2002. A hypothetical10% change in interest rates would not result in a material change in their fairvalue.ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
