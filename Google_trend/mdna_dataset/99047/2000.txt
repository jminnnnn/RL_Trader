ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following  discussion and analysis  should be read in  conjunction  with the consolidated  financial  statements  and notes thereto.  Historical  results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.  The Company  commenced its present  business  operations in January 1991 through the acquisition of a software license for its  Guided-Input(R)  Touchpad system. Since  that time,  the  Company  has  transitioned  from a hardware  vendor to a software  development  company  focusing  exclusively  on  applications  for the financial  marketplace.  The  Company  provides a complete  line of  workstation products for the  financial  trading desk  environment  and its systems  provide order  management and routing  software for firms engaged in financial  trading. During 1999 the Company achieved its first full year of profitability  since the launch  of its NYFIX  subscription  business  model in late  1997.  The  Company currently offers its trading products (integrated systems including hardware and software) together with linkage through its NYFIX data center.  The  data  center  is  a  communication   infrastructure  known  as  the  "NYFIX network"enabling  the Company to provide its  customers  with global  electronic connectivity  for order  routing  and  allows  NYFIX to deploy and  monitor  its systems and  services  from a single  location.  Customers  subscribe to various products,  paying  a  monthly  fee per  terminal  for the  Company's  integrated software  systems.  Most  contracts  provide the customer with a basic system or infrastructure,  via the Company's NYFIX data center and are entered into by the customer with the intention to expand the level of services  subscribed to, once the basic  system  and  infrastructure  are  operational.  Subscription  revenue contracts are  generally  for an initial  period of one or two years with one to three year renewal periods.  The Company begins recording  subscription  revenue once installation is complete.  Management has continued to apply a considerable  effort to the expansion of its operations and the  development of various  product  enhancements to its trading systems. The development of the NYFIX network has enabled the Company to improve its  market  share.  The  Company  believes  that its  expansion  of  personnel, facilities,  product portfolio and  subscription-based  model has positioned the Company for steady future growth.  On October 27, 1999,  the Company  announced the  formation of NYFIX  Millennium L.L.C.  ("NYFIX  Millennium")  with a consortium of seven leading  international investment  banks and brokerage  firms.  NYFIX  Millennium is  registering  as a Broker/Dealer  and plans to operate in compliance  with  Regulation  ATS.  NYFIX Millennium  is  an  "Integrated  ATS,  Exchange  Access  and  Intelligent  `Best Execution'  Order-Routing  System"  designed to provide the financial  community with "Best-Execution." NYFIX Millennium is built upon NYFIX's proprietary "Super FIX  Engine"  technology  and  existing  NYFIX  network  infrastructure.   NYFIX Millennium is a Hybrid Market System  leveraging  new  regulation and technology with the power of the traditional markets.                                         9  Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998  Revenues Subscription  revenue for 1999 exceeded the Company's  total revenue  recognized during 1998. The increase in subscription sales is partly due to a number of new products  enhancements and order routing services introduced during 1999 as well as the Company's continued increase in new orders.  Consistent with the Company's  objectives,  recurring revenue has generally been increasing on a quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis. Recurring contractual revenue  is  accounting  for a greater  share of the  Company's  total  revenue. Recurring  contractual revenue is comprised of subscription  revenue and service contracts.   Recurring   contractual   revenue  for  the  Company  increased  by approximately  137% for the year ended  December  31, 1999 (from  $3,582,000  to $8,494,000) over the comparable 1998 period.  During the year ended December 31, 1999, subscription revenues and service contracts were approximately 79% and 21% of  recurring  contractual  revenue,  respectively,  as compared to 64% and 36%, respectively,  during the  comparable  1998  period.  The  increase in recurring contractual revenue is due principally to the Company's strategy of offering its products and services on a subscription  basis rather than capital sales coupled with increased service agreements.  Sales revenue is comprised of software sales and capital equipment sales.  Sales revenue  for the  Company  increased  by  approximately  40% for the year  ended December  31,  1999  over  the  comparable  1998  period  (from   $2,653,000  to $3,715,000). During the year ended December 31, 1999, software sales and capital equipment   revenue  were   approximately   81%  and  19%  of  sales   revenues, respectively,  as compared to 61% and 39%,  respectively,  during the year ended December  31,  1998.  The increase in sales  revenue is due  principally  to the demand  of  its  OBMS   (derivatives)   products.   Revenue  from  export  sales approximated  $733,000  (approximately  6% of  revenue)  during  the year  ended December 31, 1999 as compared to  approximately  $234,000  (approximately  4% of revenue) during the comparable period in 1998.  Total revenue for the Stamford/New York location increased by approximately 121% for the year ended  December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1998.  This  increase  was  principally  due to increased  subscription  revenue recognized  throughout 1999. Total revenue for the London location  increased by approximately  32% for the year ended December 31, 1999 over the comparable 1998 period.  This  increase  was  primarily  due to an increase  in software  sales, partially offset by a decrease in hardware sales.  Total revenue for the Chicago location increased by approximately 823% for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1998 (from  $31,000 to  $286,000).  The increase   was   directly   attributable   to  the   growth  of  the   Company's subscription-based business model.  Cost of Sales and Service and Gross Profit The Company's cost of recurring contracts and sales are principally comprised of labor, materials,  overhead,  subscription  communication lines, amortization of capitalized  product  enhancement  costs and depreciation of  subscription-based equipment.  Gross profit, as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 69% and 59%  during  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  The  increase  in gross  profit percentage  experienced by the Company during fiscal 1999  principally  resulted from an  increase  in the amount of higher  margin  software  installations  and subscription  agreements.  The Company obtains its materials and supplies from a variety of vendors in the US and Far East.  During  1999,  the  Company  did not experience any significant  price  increases in its component  parts  purchased. Included in cost of sales is amortization  expense for product enhancement costs of  approximately  $719,000 and $479,000 for 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  Also included  in  cost of  sales  is  depreciation  expense  for  subscription-based equipment   of   approximately   $586,000   and  $291,000  for  1999  and  1998, respectively.  Selling, General and Administrative During fiscal 1999, selling,  general and administrative  expenses increased 20% (from  $5,494,000  to  $6,587,000)  when  compared  to fiscal  year 1998.  These increases  reflect the continued  expansion of the development teams both in the U.S.  and in  London.  The  expansion  in  development  efforts  relates  to the Company's plans of providing an increased  number of new and enhanced  services. These  services  relate to offering  subscription  and  transaction-based  order routing, via the Company's data center, to multiple  exchange-floors and between the "Buy-side" and "Sell-side"                                           10  industry. As a result, the Company experienced increases in salaries and related personnel costs,  travel expenses and various office  expenses.  During the past three  years  the  Company  added   personnel   principally  to  its  technical, programming,  service,  support and accounting  staff.  During 1999, the Company added 25 new employees. The Company's recruitment effort continues to strengthen the Company's  infrastructure  and position the Company to respond to increasing market and revenue  opportunities.  The Company,  during the past several years, has spent a considerable effort in developing and enhancing a variety of "trader desk-top" and  "exchange-floor"  trading systems.  Management  believes that the continued  investment  in  development  of the new NYFIX  data  center,  and its services,  are designed to better leverage the existing  products  together with providing  additional  sources of revenue.  The Company  decreased its marketing programs  during 1999 from 1998 and will continue to market its products in 2000 however;  a greater  emphasis  will be placed  on its newer  products  & product enhancements.  Research and development (new explorative  research) expenses for the year  ended  December  31,  1999 and 1998 were  approximately  $297,000  and $537,000, respectively, (a decrease of 45%) and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Depreciation Depreciation  expense increased by approximately 45% for the year ended December 31, 1999 over the  comparable  1998 period  (from  $457,000 to  $663,000).  Such increases   principally  reflect  the  continued  investment  in  the  Company's infrastructure in its NYFIX data center on Wall Street.  Other (Expense) Income Financing and interest expense  increased in fiscal 1999 principally  because of higher balances  outstanding on the Company's new line of credit and the cost of warrants issued to a non-employee  for the guarantee of the amounts  outstanding under the credit facility.  Other income  includes  interest  income and other  miscellaneous  non-operating items.  Interest  income in 1999 and 1998  approximated  $113,000  and  $92,000, respectively.  The 20% increase in interest  income was  principally  because of higher  average cash balances  maintained  by the Company  during the year ended December 31, 1999 versus the comparable period in 1998.  Net Earnings/(Loss) Net  earnings  for  fiscal  1999 was  approximately  $960,000  ($0.07 per share) compared  to a net loss of  $2,234,000  ($0.17 per share) for fiscal  1998.  The change in profitability  resulted from the increase in subscription type revenue and the increase in software capital sales.  See "Revenues",  "Cost of Sales and Service and Gross Profit" and "Selling, General and Administrative" above.  Management  continues to make a considerable effort with respect to expansion of its operations,  development of various trading systems, which began in 1993 and continues   into  1999  and  changes  to  its  business   model  to  that  of  a subscription-based product offering. The Company believes that this expansion of personnel,  facilities,  product  portfolio  and  subscription-based  model  has positioned the Company for future growth.  At December 31, 1999, the Company had net operating loss carryforward balance of approximately   $4,300,000,   which  expire   between   2014  and  2019.   These carryforwards  may be  significantly  limited under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,  as a result of ownership changes resulting from the Company's equity  offerings.  A  valuation  allowance  of  approximately   $2,010,300  was established  at December 31, 1999 to offset any benefit  from the net  operating loss carryforwards.                                              11  Year Ended December 31, 1998 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1997  Revenues The  increase  in  revenues  for the  year  ended  December  31,  1998  over the comparable  1997  period  was  principally  due to the  Company's  changing  its strategy to electronic  order routing which it began  executing in late 1997. In addition to the conversion from capital sales to subscription sales, a number of new  products  and  order  routing   services   under  the  NYFIX  umbrella  are contributing to the Company's continued increase in new orders and corresponding recurring revenues.  Consistent with the Company's  objectives,  recurring revenue has generally been increasing on a quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis. Recurring contractual revenue  is  accounting  for a greater  share of the  Company's  total  revenue. Recurring  contractual revenue is comprised of subscription  revenue and service contracts.   Recurring   contractual   revenue  for  the  Company  increased  by approximately  172% for the year ended  December  31, 1998 (from  $1,318,000  to $3,582,000) over the comparable 1997 period.  During the year ended December 31, 1998, subscription revenues and service contracts were approximately 64% and 36% of  recurring  contractual  revenue,  respectively,  as compared to 21% and 79%, respectively,  during the  comparable  1997  period.  The  increase in recurring contractual revenue is due principally to the Company's strategy of offering its products and services on a subscription  basis rather than capital sales coupled with increased service agreements.  Sales revenue is comprised of capital equipment sales and software sales.  Sales revenue  for the  Company  decreased  by  approximately  28% for the year  ended December  31,  1998  over  the  comparable  1997  period  (from   $3,688,000  to $2,653,000).  During the year ended December 31, 1998,  capital  equipment sales and  software  revenue  were  approximately  39%  and  61%  of  sales  revenues, respectively,  as compared to 66% and 34%,  respectively,  during the year ended December  31,  1997.  The decrease in sales  revenue is due  principally  to the Company's strategy of offering its products and services on a subscription basis rather than  capital  sales.  Revenue from export  sales  approximated  $234,000 (approximately  4% of  revenue)  during  the year  ended  December  31,  1998 as compared to approximately  $1,283,000  (approximately 26% of revenue) during the comparable period in 1997. During fiscal 1998, sales to two customers  accounted for approximately 26% of total revenue.  Total revenue for the Stamford/New York location  increased by approximately 19% for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. This increase was  principally  due to higher levels of  subscription  and service revenue  partially offset by a decrease in sales revenue  resulting from the  Company's  efforts to market its products on a  subscription  basis.  Total revenue for the London  location  increased  by  approximately  55% for the year ended December 31, 1998 over the comparable 1997 period.  This increase was also due to higher  levels of  subscription  and  service  revenue  together  with an increase in software  sales,  partially  offset by a decrease in hardware sales. Total revenue for the Chicago location  decreased by  approximately  81% for the year ended  December  31, 1998 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1997 (from $167,000 to $31,000). The decrease was directly attributable to the change in  the  Company's   business  model  from  capital  sales  to  an  emphasis  on subscription-based revenue.  Cost of Sales and Service and Gross Profit The Company's cost of recurring contracts and sales are principally comprised of labor, materials,  overhead,  subscription  communication lines, amortization of capitalized  product  enhancement  costs and depreciation of  subscription-based equipment.  Gross profit, as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 59% and 46%  during  1998 and  1997,  respectively.  The  increase  in gross  profit percentage  experienced by the Company during fiscal 1998  principally  resulted from an  increase  in the amount of higher  margin  software  installations  and subscription  agreements.  The Company obtains its materials and supplies from a variety of vendors in the US and Far East.  During  1998,  the  Company  did not experience any significant  price  increases in its component  parts  purchased. Included in cost of sales is amortization  expense for product enhancement costs of  approximately  $479,000 and $373,000 for 1998 and 1997,  respectively.  Also included  in  cost of  sales  is  depreciation  expense  for  subscription-based equipment   of   approximately   $291,000   and  $111,000  for  1998  and  1997, respectively.                                          12  Selling, General and Administrative During fiscal 1998, selling,  general and administrative  expenses increased 14% (from  $4,830,000  to  $5,494,000)  when  compared  to fiscal  year 1997.  These increases  reflect the continued  expansion of the development teams both in the U.S.  and in  London.  The  expansion  in  development  efforts  relates  to the Company's  plans of providing an increased  number of new  additional  services. These  services  relate to offering  subscription  and  transaction-based  order routing, via the Company's data center, to multiple  exchange-floors and between the "Buy-side" and "Sell-side"  industry.  As a result, the Company  experienced increases in salaries and related  personnel costs,  travel expenses and various office  expenses.  During  the  past  two  years  the  Company  added  personnel principally  to its  technical,  programming,  service,  support and  accounting staff. During 1998, the Company added 7 new employees. The Company's recruitment effort  continues to strengthen  the Company's  infrastructure  and position the Company to respond to increasing market and revenue opportunities.  The Company, during the past several years,  has spent a considerable  effort in developing a variety of "trader desk-top" and  "exchange-floor"  trading systems.  Management believes that the investment in  development  of the new NYFIX data center,  and its services,  are designed to better  leverage the existing  products  together with  providing  additional  sources of revenue.  The Company has  continued its marketing  programs in 1998 primarily  focusing on public relations  activities, production of various product  brochures,  and  representation  at technological exhibitions  planned  throughout  the year.  The Company will continue to expand these programs during 1999. Research and development (new explorative  research) expenses  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998 and 1997  were  approximately $537,000 and  $322,000,  respectively,  (an increase of 67%) and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Depreciation Depreciation expense increased by approximately 145% for the year ended December 31, 1998 over the  comparable  1997 period  (from  $186,000 to  $457,000).  Such increases   principally  reflect  the  continued  investment  in  the  Company's infrastructure in its state of the art NYFIX data center on Wall Street.  Other (Expense) Income Financing and interest expense  increased in fiscal 1998 principally  because of higher balances  outstanding on the Company's new line of credit and the cost of warrants issued to a non-employee  for the guarantee of the amounts  outstanding under the credit facility.  Other income  includes  interest  income and other  miscellaneous  non-operating items.  Interest  income in 1998 and 1997  approximated  $92,000  and  $133,000, respectively.  The 31% decrease in interest  income was  principally  because of lower  average cash  balances  maintained  by the Company  during the year ended December 31, 1998 versus the comparable  period in 1997. The Company  previously leased a portion of its corporate  office facility under a three-year  sublease, which expired on April 30, 1997. Due to the continuing  expansion of operations, (see "Selling, General and Administrative" above) the Company has decided not to renew the  sublease  and  incorporated  such space into its  existing  corporate facility. Sublease rental income earned during 1997 approximated $13,000.  Net Loss Net loss for fiscal 1998 was $2,234,000 ($0.17 per share) compared to a net loss of  $2,594,000  ($0.21  per share) for fiscal  1997.  The  decrease  in net loss principally  resulted  from the  increase in  subscription  type revenue and the increase in software capital sales.  See "Revenues",  "Cost of Sales and Service and Gross Profit" and "Selling, General and Administrative" above.  Management  has made a  considerable  effort with respect to an expansion of its operations,  development  of various  trading  systems,  which began in 1993 and continues   into  1998  and  changes  to  its  business   model  to  that  of  a subscription-based product offering. The Company believes that this expansion of personnel,  facilities,  product  portfolio  and  subscription-based  model will better position the Company and facilitate its future growth.  However, in spite of its optimism,  management is also  cautioning  that the Company's  aggressive conversion  from a capital  sales model to  subscription-based  model is causing revenue recognition from subscription-based  orders to be realized over a longer period of time than the previous capital sales model.  At December  31,  1998,  the Company had net  operating  loss carry  forwards of approximately  $5,270,000,  which  expire  between  2008 and 2013.  These  carry forwards may be  significantly  limited under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as a result of ownership changes resulting from the Company's equity offerings.   A  valuation   allowance  of                                         13  approximately $2,400,000 has been established at December 31, 1998 to offset any benefit from the net operating loss carry  forwards,  as it cannot be determined when or if the Company will be able to utilize the net operating losses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company's primary source of liquidity has been equity capital and draw downs from  its  line of  credit.  In  November  of 1998  NYFIX  raised  approximately $3,450,000 and in September of 1999 raised approximately $2,547,000 from private placements of its securities.  At December 31, 1999, cash balances  decreased to $1,566,000  from  $3,948,000  at December 31, 1998 as a result of the  Company's working  capital  needs  and  continued  desire  to  strengthen  its  NYFIX  and subscription infrastructure.  The Company at December 31, 1999 had total debt of $2,500,000,  which represents amounts drawn down from its line of credit.  See discussion  below. In addition, at December  31,  1999,  the Company  had no  material  commitments  for capital expenditures or inventory purchases.  On July 13,  1998,  the Company  entered  into a  three-year  $3 million line of credit agreement (the "Agreement") with a financial institution with advances on such  agreement  available  to the  Company  during  the  first 18  months.  The Agreement  is  primarily  intended  to finance  existing  and  future  equipment expenditures.  The  Agreement  bears  interest at either LIBOR plus 1.25% or the Bank's Prime rate. The rate used is  management's  discretion.  The Company drew down  an  aggregate  of  $1,800,000  under  the  agreement  during  1998  and an additional  $700,000  during  August of 1999.  The  Agreement  requires  monthly payments of interest only until January 30, 2000.  Principal drawdowns under the Agreement cannot be prepaid in the first eighteen months. Repayment of principal commences on July 30, 2000 with twelve monthly  installments of $83,333 with the remaining balance due on July 30, 2001. A Company  shareholder and the Company's president  personally  secure  the  debt.  In  consideration  for  securing  the Agreement,  the said  shareholder  and  president  received  150,000  and 25,000 warrants  respectively,  to purchase  the  Company's  common stock at $6.375 per share, which was the market value of the Company's common stock on the date such warrants were issued. Expense related to the warrants issued to the non-employee shareholder will be recognized over the three-year term of the Agreement.  In  association  with  obtaining  the $3 million  line of credit  facility,  the Company  terminated its previous $500,000 line of credit agreement (revised from $1 million  line of credit  agreement  in June 1998) and repaid all  outstanding term loans.  In addition,  the Company has warrants  outstanding  for the purchase of 367,500 shares of its  Common  Stock.  Assuming  the  exercise  of all such  outstanding warrants, the Company would receive approximately $1,512,000 in gross proceeds.  On October 27, 1999, NYFIX announced the formation of NYFIX  Millennium,  with a consortium  of seven leading  international  banks and  brokerage  firms.  NYFIX Millennium  intends to  operate as an  alternative  trading  system.  All of the members of the consortium,  including NYFIX, Inc. have invested  $2,000,000 each in NYFIX Millennium.  In addition,  each of the seven non-NYFIX members received 187,500  shares of common  stock of NYFIX  totaling  1,312,500  shares of common stock (adjusted for stock split).  Working Capital At December 31, 1999 and 1998 the Company had working  capital of  approximately $4,488,000 and $5,970,000, respectively. The Company's present capital resources include  proceeds  from its 1999 and 1998 private  placement of Common Stock and drawdowns from its bank credit facility.  Cash Used in Operating Activities During fiscal 1999, net cash earned from operations was approximately $1,583,000 as  compared  to cash  used  in  operations  in  fiscal  1998  of  approximately $1,159,000.   The  increase  from  fiscal  1998  to  fiscal  1999  is  primarily attributable  to the  change  in  profitability  from a  loss  of  approximately $2,234,000 in 1998 to net income of approximately $960,000.                                           14  Cash Used in Investing Activities During fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998,  net cash used in investing  activities  was approximately   $7,907,000  and   $3,152,000,   respectively,   and  principally represents the Company's investment in NYFIX Millennium, along with payments for the increased  purchases of equipment  related to the Company's  data center and subscription equipment and payments related to product enhancement costs for the Company's product portfolio.  Proceeds From Financing Activities During fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998,  proceeds  from  financing  activities  were approximately $3,942,000 and $6,117,000,  respectively.  Such increase in fiscal 1999  primarily  resulted from the issuance of Common Stock through the issuance of common  stock for the  investment  of NYFIX  Millennium  and the  exercise of warrants and stock options totaling approximately $874,000, and borrowings under our credit line of approximately $700,000.   Year 2000 Compliance  NYFIX  completed a Year 2000 plan  consisting of several  phases which  include, risk  assessment,  manual and automated  review of  programming  code,  baseline testing, unit testing,  integrated testing and a review of third party products. Our systems, both internal and external,  were fully functional during and after the  calendar  year and leap year  transitions.  The  Company  will  continue to monitor critical business systems for possible Year 2000 system issues.   Seasonality The Company  believes  that its  operations  are not  significantly  effected by seasonality.   New Accounting Pronouncements  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities." This statement establishes   standards  for  the   accounting   and  reporting  for  derivative instruments  and for hedging  activities  and  requires the  recognition  of all derivatives  as assets or  liabilities  measured at their fair  value.  Gains or losses  resulting  from  changes  in the  fair  value  of  derivatives  would be recognized in earnings in the period of change unless certain  hedging  criteria are met.  We do not  expect  the  Statement  to have a  material  impact  on our consolidated  financial statements.  The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999.  ITEM 7a. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The  Company is exposed to market  risk  principally  with  changes in  interest rates.  Interest  rate  exposure is  principally  limited to the $2.5 million of long-term  debt  outstanding  at December 31, 1999,  under the Company's line of credit agreement. Borrowings under the line of credit agreement bear interest at rates that float with the market.  Assuming a change of 100 basis  points in the interest rates on the line of credit agreement,  interest expense and cash flows would be affected by approximately  $25,000 on an annual basis. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for any purpose.   ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  AND  SUPPLEMENTARY  DATA See index to  Financial
