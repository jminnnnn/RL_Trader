ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following  discussion and analysis  should be read in  conjunction  with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.  The  Company  commenced  operations  in  January  1991,  initially  focusing  on order-capturing of trading information via its Guided-Input(R)  Touchpad system, and since then has transitioned from a hardware vendor to a provider of complete infrastructure,  systems,  software and  wireless  trading  technologies  to the brokerage industry. The Company provides electronic trading and straight-through trade  processing  solutions to various  participants in the brokerage  industry such as brokerage firms,  international  banks and global  exchanges  trading in equities,  futures, options and currencies. The Company's deployment of products and services via the  Company's  NYFIX network has resulted in its customer base processing  a daily  volume  ranging  from as low as 200  million  shares in the beginning  of the year to single  trading days  exceeding  more than 500 million shares towards the end of year 2000.  By 1996, the financial  services industry had adopted the Financial  Information Exchange Protocol,  commonly referred to as the FIX protocol, which provides the brokerage  industry  with a common  underlying  language  to  enable  electronic trading and  communications.  In late 1997,  the Company  built a  communication infrastructure  known as the "NYFIX network"  utilizing the FIX protocol through an individual  dedicated  circuit into the NYFIX network  which  provides  NYFIX customers  with global  electronic  connectivity  for trade order  routing.  The Company  currently offers its NYFIX services,  consisting of integrated  systems including  hardware and software,  together with linkage  through its NYFIX data center.  Customers  subscribe  to NYFIX  services  by paying a  monthly  fee per terminal  for  use of  the  Company's  integrated  infrastructure  and  software systems.  Beginning in late 1997, the Company  focused  primarily on selling its products and services on a subscription basis with ongoing monthly  subscription fees rather than a software  and capital  equipment  sales model with  one-time, upfront fees.  Since making this  transition,  total  revenues have increased to $23,980,000  in 2000 from  $5,006,000 in 1997,  representing  a compound  annual growth rate of 69%. The Company has been  profitable  since the first quarter of 1999 and has had eight consecutive quarters of increasing profitability.  The  Company's  revenues  comprise  subscription,  sales  and  service  contract revenue. Consistent with the Company's transition to a subscription sales model, subscription  fees represent a majority and increasing  share of total revenues. Subscription revenue contracts are primarily with brokerage firms, international banks and global exchanges trading in equities, and are generally for an initial period  of  one  to  three  years  with  one  to  three  year  renewal  periods. Subscription  revenues are recognized ratably over the lives of the subscription agreements  with  customers  and begin  once  installation  is  complete.  Sales revenue,  which is comprised of software sales and capital  equipment  sales, is generated primarily by sales to customers in the futures, options and currencies trading market, and is expected to decrease as a percentage of total revenues as the Company  continues to shift its focus to  servicing  those  markets  using a subscription fee model. Sales revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product and  acceptance  by the  customer.  Service  contract  revenue is  comprised  of maintenance contracts for capital sales equipment and subscription equipment and is  recognized  ratably  over the period that the service is  provided.  Service contract  revenue on  subscription  contracts is charged to customers as a fixed percentage of such contracts.  Cost of revenues  principally  consists  of  subscription  communication  lines, amortization  of  capitalized  product  enhancement  costs and  depreciation  of subscription-based equipment, labor, materials and overhead.  Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  account for the majority of the Company's  operating  expenses  and consist of salaries and  benefits,  rent and office  expenses,  non-customer  specific  communication  fees,  provisions  for doubtful  accounts and marketing  expenses.  During the past several years,  the Company has expanded its efforts to support an increasing number of services and to increase the number of exchanges, brokerage firms and "buy-side" institutions connecting  to  the  NYFIX  network.  Management  believes  that  its  continued investment  in  the   development   of  the  NYFIX  system  and  its  associated applications  and  services  has  increased  order  flow,  which in turn  should facilitate both revenue growth and further distribution of its products.  Research  and  development  expenses  relate  to  developing  new  products  and technologies  to meet the current and future needs of the  Company's  customers. These costs  consist  primarily of salaries and related  costs for technical                                         8    and programming personnel.  Depreciation and amortization  expense consists of depreciation and amortization of equipment and software used to operate the Company's systems.  On October 27, 1999,  the Company  announced the  formation of NYFIX  Millennium L.L.C., a consortium of the Company and seven international investment banks and brokerage  firms,  consisting of Deutsche  Bank, ING Barings,  Lehman  Brothers, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., SG Cowen Securities and UBS Warburg.  NYFIX Millennium is registered as a Broker/Dealer and is operating in compliance with Regulation ATS. In October 2000, NYFIX  Millennium  commenced the roll-out of its ATS on a limited basis to the Company's existing clients and is  allowing  them to use the  system  without  charging  for  orders  executed. Although the number of users and orders  passing  through NYFIX  Millennium  has been increasing, the Company currently does not anticipate that NYFIX Millennium will generate revenue until sufficient liquidity has been established within the system. Once sufficient liquidity is established in the system, NYFIX Millennium intends to generate  revenue by charging for each transaction on a fee per share basis.  On March 14,  2001,  NYFIX  Millennium  added  Bank of America  and First  Union Securities as new partners, with additional partners and funding expected in the near term. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement of NYFIX Millennium, each new partner  contributed  $2,000,000 to NYFIX  Millennium,  and the Company maintained  its 50%  ownership  interest in NYFIX  Millennium  in  exchange  for reducing  certain of its  rights to share in future  dividend  distributions  of NYFIX  Millennium.  The Company issued 94,000 shares of its common stock to each new partner in return for the same option rights noted above.  Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999  Revenues Subscription  revenue  increased 137% to $15,955,000 in 2000, from $6,733,000 in 1999,  principally due to increased desktop placements among existing customers, and also  the  addition  of new  customers  and new  product  offerings  sold to existing and new  customers.  As a percentage  of total  revenues,  subscription revenue increased to 67% in 2000 from 55% in 1999.  Sales revenue  increased 37% to $5,089,000 in 2000, from $3,715,000 in 1999. The increase  in  sales  revenue  is  principally  due to  customer  demand  for the Company's Order Book Management  System ("OBMS")  derivatives  trading  software products.  As a percentage of total revenue,  sales revenue  decreased to 21% in 2000, from 30% in 1999,  which is consistent with the Company's  transition to a subscription-based  model,  with software sales comprising the majority of sales revenue.  Service contract revenue increased 67% to $2,936,000 in 2000, from $1,761,000 in 1999,  principally due to an increase in subscription contract revenue. In 2000, service contract revenue  comprised 12% of total revenue,  as compared to 14% in 1999.  Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of total revenues increased to 73% in 2000 from 69% in 1999. The increase in gross profit  percentage  principally  resulted from an increase in the amount of higher  margin  software  installations  and  improved pricing on  communication  charges  relating  to  subscription  agreements.  The Company obtains its materials and supplies from a variety of vendors in the U.S. and Far East and did not  experience  any  significant  price  increases  in its component  parts  purchased  during  2000.  Included  in  cost of  revenues  was amortization expense of product enhancement costs of $1,185,000 and $719,000 for 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Also included in cost of revenues was depreciation expense for subscription-based equipment of $1,257,000 and $586,000 for 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Selling, General and Administrative Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  increased  50% to $9,419,000 in 2000,  from  $6,290,000 in 1999, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues to 39% in  2000  from  52% in  1999.  The  dollar  increase  reflects  increased salaries,  related personnel costs, rent expense and various office expenses due to personnel  increases to support the                                         9    Company's growth. Also increasing were  non-recoverable  communication fees, and bad debt  expense  primarily  due to certain  independent  brokers  going out of business during 2000.  Research and Development Research  and  development  expenses  increased  53% to $454,000  in 2000,  from $297,000  in 1999,  as the  Company  continued  to  research  ways to expand its product portfolio.  Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization  expenses increased 89% to $1,255,000 in 2000 from $663,000  in  1999,  reflecting  principally  the  continued  investment  in the Company's infrastructure.  Interest Expense Interest  expense  increased  50% to  $333,000 in 2000,  from  $222,000 in 1999, principally  as a result of capital  lease  obligations  entered into during the period and higher average  balances  outstanding on the Company's line of credit due to the draw down of an additional $700,000 in August 1999, offset in part by repayment of the principal of $83,000 a month commencing in July 2000.  Interest Income Interest  income  increased  38% to  $156,000  in 2000,  from  $113,000 in 1999, principally due to higher average cash balances maintained by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2000 versus the comparable period in 1999.  Provision for Income Taxes The  provision for income taxes  increased to $601,000 in 2000,  from $94,000 in 1999.  As of  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  established  a full  valuation allowance of  $2,010,000  for its  deferred  tax assets based upon  management's determination  of the amount that would  ultimately be realized.  Based upon the continued  profitability  of the Company during 2000 as well as expected  future profitability,  management  determined as of December 31, 2000, that a valuation allowance was no longer required.  At December 31, 2000, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward  balance for federal  income tax purposes of  $3,776,000,  expiring in 2014 through 2019. This  carryforward  balance  may be  significantly  limited  under the  Internal Revenue  Code as a result of  ownership  changes  resulting  from the  Company's equity offerings.  In the event that the Company continues to be profitable,  as it has been since the first quarter of 1999,  the Company will have income taxes on its  earnings.  These  taxes  will  have an effect  on the  Company's  future reported net earnings and cash flows.  Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998  Revenues Subscription  revenue  increased 196% to $6,733,000 in 1999,  from $2,278,000 in 1998. The increase in  subscription  revenue is principally due to the Company's transition from offering its products and services on a capital sales basis to a subscription basis. The increase in subscription revenue is also partly due to a number of new product  enhancements and order routing services introduced during the year as well as the Company's continued increase in new orders.  Sales revenue  increased 40% to $3,715,000 in 1999, from $2,653,000 in 1998. The increase  in sales  revenue  was  principally  due to  increased  demand for the Company's OBMS derivatives trading software.  Service contract revenue increased 35% to $1,761,000 in 1999, from $1,304,000 in 1998,  primarily due to the increase in subscription  contract revenue. In 1999, service contract revenue comprised 14% of total revenues,  as compared to 21% in 1998.  Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of total  revenues  increased to 69% in 1999,  from 59% in 1998,  principally  due to an  increase  in the  amount of higher  margin software installations and subscription agreements. During 1999, the Company did not experience any significant  price  increases in component  parts  purchased. Included in cost of sales was                                         10    amortization  expense for product enhancement costs of $719,000 and $479,000 for 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  Also  included in cost of sales was  depreciation expense for  subscription-based  equipment of $586,000 and $291,000 for 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Selling, General and Administrative Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  increased  27% to $6,290,000 in 1999, from $4,957,000 in 1998. This increase reflected increases in salaries and related personnel costs,  travel expenses and various office expenses  resulting from continued expansion both in the U.S. and in London.  Research and Development Research  and  development  expenses  decreased  45% to $297,000  in 1999,  from $537,000 in 1998, primarily as a result of the Company focusing on enhancing its existing product line in 1999 as opposed to developing new products in 1998.  Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization  expenses  increased 40% to $663,000 in 1999, from $475,000  in  1998,  reflecting  principally  the  continued  investment  in the Company's infrastructure in its NYFIX data center.  Interest Expense Interest expense increased 106% to $222,000 in 1999, from $108,000 in 1998. This increase  was  principally  a  result  of  higher  balances  outstanding  on the Company's  new line of credit and the cost of warrants  issued for the guarantee of the amounts outstanding under the line of credit.  Interest Income Interest  income  increased  23% to  $113,000  in 1999,  from  $92,000  in 1998, principally as a result of higher cash balances maintained by the Company.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Prior to achieving the Company's present levels of profitability,  the Company's primary  source of  liquidity  had been equity  capital and  drawdowns  from the Company's line of credit agreement.  In November 1998 and in September 1999, the Company raised $3,450,000 and $2,547,000,  respectively, from private placements of  securities.  At December 31,  2000,  the cash and cash  equivalents  balance increased to $4,867,000  from $1,566,000 at December 31, 1999 as a result of the increase  in net  earnings  and the  exercise  of stock  options  and  warrants, partially offset by capital  expenditures and the acquisition of other assets to support the Company's infrastructure and repayments under the line of credit.  At December 31, 2000, the Company had total debt of $3,823,000, which represents amounts  outstanding  under the line of credit and  capital  lease  obligations. Subsequent to year-end,  the Company has entered into capital lease  obligations for service bureau equipment valued at $524,000. The leases are for a three-year period,  with  annual  payments  of  $193,000.  Except for these  capital  lease obligations,  at December 31, 2000, the Company had no material  commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases.  On July 13,  1998,  the Company  entered  into a  three-year  $3 million line of credit  agreement with a financial  institution  with advances on such agreement available to the Company  during the first 18 months.  The credit  agreement was primarily intended to finance equipment expenditures. The credit agreement bears interest at either LIBOR plus 1.25% or the bank's prime rate,  at the  Company's discretion. The Company drew down an aggregate of $1,800,000 under the agreement during  1998 and an  additional  $700,000  during  1999.  The  credit  agreement prohibited  the Company from making  principal  repayments  prior to February 1, 2000.  Repayment  of principal  commenced  on July 30, 2000 with twelve  monthly installments  of $83,333  with the  remaining  balance due on July 30,  2001.  A non-employee  shareholder of the Company and the Company's president  personally secured the debt.  In  consideration  for  securing  the credit  agreement,  the non-employee shareholder and the Company's president received 337,500 and 56,250 warrants,  respectively,  to purchase the Company's  common stock at $2.8333 per share, which was the market value of the Company's common stock on the date such warrants were issued.  Expense related to the warrants is being  recognized over the three-year term of the credit agreement.                                         11    The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity,  including cash generated from operations and issuances of common stock,  to support its cash needs in the year 2001.  Working Capital At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had working capital of $9,159,000 and $4,513,000, respectively, representing an 82% improvement. The Company's present capital resources  include proceeds from internal  operations and from issuances of common stock.  Cash Provided by Operating Activities During 2000, net cash provided by operations was $9,432,000,  as compared to net cash provided by  operations  of $2,445,000 in 1999.  This increase is primarily attributable  to the 491% increase in net  earnings,  to $5,676,000 in 2000 from $960,000 in 1999.  Cash Used in Investing Activities During 2000 and 1999,  net cash used in investing  activities was $9,387,000 and $8,769,000,  respectively.  The  increase  principally  represents  payments for purchases of equipment  related to the  Company's  data center and  subscription equipment and payments  related to product  enhancement  costs for the Company's product portfolio, along with advances made to NYFIX Millennium.  Cash Provided By Financing Activities During 2000 and 1999, net proceeds from financing activities were $3,256,000 and $3,942,000,  respectively.  During 2000 proceeds of $3,955,000 from the exercise of warrants and stock  options were  partially  offset by  repayments  under the credit line of $500,000 and principal  payments under capital lease  obligations of $200,000.  During 1999,  proceeds were $2,547,000 from a private placement of common  stock,  the exercise of warrants and stock  options  generated  funds of $695,000, and borrowings under our line of credit were $700,000.  Seasonality  The Company  believes  that its  operations  are not  significantly  effected by seasonality.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 133  ("SFAS  133"),   "Accounting   for  Derivative   Instruments   and  Hedging Activities." SFAS 133 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133, as amended,  establishes  accounting and reporting standards for derivative  instruments,  including certain derivative  instruments  embedded in other contracts and for hedging  activities.  Under SFAS 133, certain  contracts that were not formerly  considered  derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative.  The Company adopted SFAS 133 effective January 1, 2001.  Management believes that the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.  In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting  Bulletin  No. 101 ("SAB  101"),  "Revenue  Recognition  in Financial Statements." SAB 101 summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting  principles to revenue recognition in financial  statements. The  adoption  of SAB 101 did not have an effect on the  Company's  consolidated financial statements.  In March 2000, the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 44,  "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation" ("FIN 44"). FIN 44, an interpretation of APB 25, provides guidance on the application of APB 25 for stock compensation involving  employees.  The  adoption  of FIN 44 did not  have an  effect  on the Company's consolidated financial statements.                                         12     ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company is exposed to financial market risks,  including changes in interest rates and foreign  currency  exchange rates. The Company does not use derivative financial  instruments  for any purpose.  Interest rate exposure is  principally limited to the $2 million  current  portion of  long-term  debt  outstanding  at December 31, 2000,  under the  Company's  line of credit  agreement.  Borrowings under the line of credit  agreement  bear  interest at rates that float with the market.  The impact of a 100 basis point change in the interest rate on the line of credit agreement would not be material to earnings, cash flows or fair value. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated  financial statements,  the financial statements of the Company's London sales office are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the U.S.  dollar as the functional  currency.  The market risk  associated with  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  is not  material  in  relation  to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
