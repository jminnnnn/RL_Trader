Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K. The information presented in the following tables has been adjusted to reflect the 2005 Restatement of our financial results which is more fully described in the Introductory Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I of this report on Form 10-K, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   We derived the selected consolidated financial data for the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003 from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto appearing in this report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of the years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001 have been restated and are presented herein on an unaudited basis.    We have not amended our annual reports on Form 10-K or quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods affected by the 2005 Restatement. The information that has been previously filed or otherwise reported for these periods is superseded by the information in this report on Form 10-K, and the financial statements and related financial information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon.                              -53-                                     Year Ended December 31,    2005    2004    2003    2002    2001        (in thousands, except per share amounts)     Consolidated statement of operations data:     (1)     Restated   (A) (1)     Restated  (A) (1) (2)     Restated  (A) (1) (3) (6)     Restated  (A) (1) (6)      Revenue:                                                                                           Subscription and maintenance        $   62,370         $   51,974         $   44,516         $   40,228         $   32,274              Product sales and services          9,025           8,015           8,785           7,746           7,123              Transaction          26,222           14,827           12,877           7,148           -

In some cases, forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believes, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, and similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to our plans, expectations, strategies or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or conditions to differ from those anticipated by these and other forward-looking statements include those more fully described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business may have changed since the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.              You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in this report on Form 10-K.  The following discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement of our financial results for periods prior to 2005 which is more fully described below under the caption Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.            Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements   As described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have restated our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods and related financial statement disclosures to reflect adjustments necessary to correct accounting errors (the 2005 Restatement). The 2005 Restatement corrects errors in the previously reported Consolidated Financial Statements for years 1993 through 2004. Previously, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 (filed in June 2005), the Company, led then by a different Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, corrected errors in our previously reported Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal years 1993 through 2003 and interim periods in 2004 (the 2004 Restatement).  We have concluded that the 2004 Restatement was incomplete and incorrect, and believe that the 2005 Restatement addresses those defects.    On August 1, 2005, after the issuance of the audited consolidated financial statements as part of the 2004 Restatement, Deloitte, our independent registered public accounting firm at the time, asked the Audit Committee to provide answers to particular questions related to stock option grants, including questions about the accuracy of minutes, the accuracy of a grant date, the timing of particular grants, whether grants were reallocated after a Board or Compensation Committee meeting, and the grant and measurement dates the Company had used prior to any reallocation.  Deloitte informed the Audit Committee that it was suspending all audit and review services to the Company until its questions were addressed and remedial action was taken.  In connection with efforts to permit the Company to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q due August 14, 2005, the Audit Committee on August 1, 2005 asked our outside counsel, working together with former management, to review the testimony and documents produced up to that time in the SEC inquiry relating to these questions and to provide a report to the Audit Committee about the relevant information provided to the SEC to date.  After a report to Deloitte on August 4, 2005 responding to certain questions, the Audit Committee directed former management to conduct a second internal review of our historical activities relating to stock option grants. The Audit Committee also retained separate outside counsel to assist in the Audit Committees oversight of this second internal review and in the Audit Committees response to Deloitte.    In October 2005, former management completed its second internal review and issued a report to the Audit Committee, which included certain conclusions of our outside counsel on limited questions delegated to counsel. On October 19, 2005, the Company announced that, as directed by the Audit Committee, it had completed its review of the accounting for stock options and that it believed the Company's non-cash compensation expense for stock option grants, primarily in the years 1999 to 2004, was understated                              -58-                             by approximately $2.0 million.  The Company announced that, accordingly, it would restate its financial results.    The Audit Committee reviewed the report with Deloitte and, shortly thereafter on October 26, 2005, Deloitte informed the Chairman of the Audit Committee that Deloitte was unwilling to continue as independent registered public accountants of the Company or to rely on the representations of former management.    Following the resignation of Deloitte, during November 2005, the Board began to implement the management and corporate governance changes described below, which led to the 2005 Restatement, as described below.  See also Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    The 2005 Restatement reflects the accounting conclusions of current management following our extensive internal review of historical stock-based compensation awards as well as our overall accounting review.  Our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 have been re-audited by our independent registered public accounting firm engaged in November 2005.  Our internal review was overseen by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and a special Subcommittee of the Audit Committee formed in connection with a restructuring of the Board and of management that commenced in September 2005.   The 2005 Restatement corrected accounting errors, decreasing previously reported results of operations (both pre-tax and post-tax) by $42.1 million. The items restated consist of the following:   Stock-Based Compensation , increasing (decreasing) pre-tax and post-tax results by $(0.3) million for 2004, $(3.0) million for 2003, $4.6 million for 2002, $(9.3) million for 2001 and $(30.4) million for prior periods. These errors were primarily associated with post-grant modifications of options, including extensions, accelerations, repricings and increases in shares; exercises of options and warrants using non-recourse notes; and incorrect determinations of measurement dates and resulting determinations of intrinsic values of stock option awards.   Acquisitions and Investments,  increasing (decreasing) pre-tax and post-tax results by $0.2 million for 2004, $(2.9) million for 2003 and $(2.8) million for 2002. These errors were associated with the incorrect application of the equity method of accounting for the initial investment in and full acquisition of Renaissance, an entity in which we absorbed all of the losses; the incorrect use of the equity method of accounting for the losses of EuroLink, an entity over which we had effective control; and the incorrect determination of purchase price, goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisitions of Renaissance, EuroLink and Javelin Technologies, Inc.    Revenue Recognition , reversing $2.0 million of revenue and resulting pre-tax and post-tax results recorded in 2001 related to transactions with an entity operated by substantially the same principals as EuroLink prior to our initial investment in EuroLink in 2002. The $2.0 million was paid by EuroLink out of proceeds from an initial investment made by us in EuroLink in 2002. We also adjusted revenue and resulting pre-tax and post-tax results recorded by NYFIX Overseas due to the timing of delivery of products and service periods. The NYFIX Overseas adjustments included a $0.4 million decrease to revenues for 2004, a $0.1 million increase to revenues for 2003 and a $0.7 million decrease to revenues for 2002.   Income Tax Expense , associated with the need for a valuation allowance on the realizable value of net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 1999. From 1999 through the third quarter of 2004, we had not reserved for the value of our net deferred tax assets. The decision to establish an allowance as of 1999 in the 2005 Restatement reflects our view that historical pre-tax book income and historical income for tax purposes, including the impacts of the restatement adjustments noted above and of non-recurring items, were not sufficient to support a conclusion at that time that the value of net deferred tax assets was more likely than not to be realized. As a result, the provision (benefit) for                              -59-                             income taxes for 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and prior periods has been adjusted resulting in an increase (decrease) in our net loss of $(18.9) million, $4.6 million, $4.4 million, $(4.2) million and $9.3 million, respectively.   Treasury Stock , associated with a charge to accumulated deficit in 2004 for $0.3 million for the difference between the fair market value of our stock on the date shares were issued from treasury and the average cost of the treasury shares on that date, which shares were issued in connection with certain principal payments under notes payable. This charge is offset by an increase to additional paid in capital.   Internal Review of Stock-Based Compensation   In November 2005, we commenced an extensive document review in connection with the SECs investigation into our stock option practices under the oversight of the recently established Subcommittee of the Audit Committee.  This document review was a necessary step in completing our review of our accounting for historical stock-based compensation awards, which was conducted under the oversight of the Audit Committee and the Subcommittee.  In February 2006, Steven Vigliotti, our Chief Financial Officer (CFO) hired in January 2006, assumed management oversight of the internal review.  The 2005 Restatement is based on this internal review.   This internal review was performed with the assistance of over sixty contract lawyers and accountants and required us to expend significant resources.  The review included interviews with current and former employees and current and former Board members, the creation of a new stock-compensation grant database, and the examination of:                                  every stock option grant from 1991 (inception) through 2004, including related cancellations and exercises, or approximately 1,500 awards (or portions of awards) of options covering 12.7 million shares granted to approximately 450 grantees;                                        certain warrants, covering 2.0 million shares, issued to directors, officers and employees;                                         non-recourse loans issued to pay for option and warrant exercises;                                        accounting policies, accounting records and material previously filed with the SEC; and                                         hundreds of thousands of documents and supporting documentation, including payroll records, offer letters, employment contracts, Board of Directors and Compensation Committee meeting minutes (including resolutions and schedules), email communications, and meta-data for such documents (such as computer generated and fax header date and time stamps), to the extent available.              Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes detailed findings of the internal review. These findings include (i) grants to officers and directors which were made outside the terms of the stock option plans then in effect; (ii) modifications of grants to Peter Hansen, our founder, former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairman and a current director, where evidence could not be located to demonstrate that the modifications were authorized by the Board or Compensation Committee; (iii) retroactive reinstatement of the employment status of Richard Castillo, our former CFO and Secretary, after he had discontinued providing employee services and the continued vesting of his outstanding awards; (iv) subsequent changing of vesting terms with retroactive documentation as of an earlier date; (v) grant schedules to the minutes of Board or Compensation Committee meetings included awards that were not initiated until after the dates of these meetings; (vi) grant schedules to the minutes of Board or Compensation Committee meetings included awards which were modified after the dates of such meetings to increase the number of options granted or to decrease the exercise price, but which were included on such schedules as if they had been granted in modified form on the dates of the Board or Compensation Committee meetings; (vii) options and warrants exercised by officers and directors with non-recourse notes where evidence could not be located to demonstrate that the issuance of such notes was approved by the Board or Compensation Committee; and (viii) other circumstances indicating the                              -60-                             issuance of in-the-money grants. The modifications to Mr. Hansens grants noted in (ii) above resulted in the recording of a $25 million charge in March 2000 based on the incremental intrinsic value on the date assumed to be the modification date. Please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a fuller description of these findings.   Remedial Actions   In September 2005, the Board appointed two new outside directors to the Board, Richard Roberts and Lon Gorman.  At its next regular meeting in November 2005, the Board revised the membership of its committees.  Following that action, William Jennings remained Chairman of the Audit Committee, Thomas Wajnert remained on the Audit Committee, and Mr. Gorman joined the Audit Committee; George Deehan (Chairman), William Lynch and Mr. Gorman constituted the Compensation Committee; and Mr. Lynch (Chairman), Mr. Deehan and Mr. Jennings constituted the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.  At that time, the Audit Committee appointed Messrs. Wajnert and Gorman to the Subcommittee of the Audit Committee authorized to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, such analyses, investigations, reports and other actions relating to investigations by the SEC as the Subcommittee deemed to be appropriate.  In November 2005, Mr. Wajnert was appointed non-executive Lead Director to coordinate the activities of the independent directors and consult with the then executive Chairman; additionally, the Board also commenced making significant changes in management.  Mr. Hansen resigned as CEO in November 2005, stepped down as Chairman of the Board in September 2006 and remains a director of the Company.  Mr. Gorman succeeded Mr. Hansen as Chairman of the Board in October 2006.     In November 2005, the Board appointed Robert Gasser as CEO, replacing Mr. Hansen. In January 2006, the Board appointed Steven Vigliotti as CFO, replacing Mark Hahn.    In June 2006, the Board increased the exercise prices of certain grants still outstanding to certain directors and officers (including Messrs. Hansen, Lynch, Deehan, Jennings, Brian Bellardo, our General Counsel and Secretary, and Mr. Hahn, a former CFO and for a period of time Secretary) where a higher exercise price was deemed more appropriate. We did not adjust grants to rank and file employees.   In February 2007, the Board adopted Equity Award Guidelines (the Guidelines) covering the authorization, timing, documentation and verification of equity awards. The Guidelines include provisions which among other things provide that: awards shall only be made by the Compensation Committee or, for non-employee directors, by the Board; the granting process for annual awards to existing employees is intended to occur at a regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the Compensation Committee during the first half of the fiscal year, after preliminary or final year-end financial results are announced and the annual operating budget for the current fiscal year has been submitted to the Board, except that, in the first half of 2007, any awards  may be made at any regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the Compensation Committee; inducement or new-hire grants can not be effective prior to commencement of the recipients services to the Company; and inducement or new-hire grants and other grants to recently promoted employees or for retention purposes may be made at a regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the Compensation Committee or by unanimous written consent.  The Guidelines also specify documentation and grant verification procedures.     We had suspended the granting of new stock-based compensation awards since April 2005 until the completion of our internal review and adoption of the Guidelines.    SEC Investigation and Related Contingencies    We filed a current report on Form 8-K on February 25, 2005 indicating our belief that the informal investigation related to certain stock option grants initiated by the SEC in October 2004 had become formal. We are cooperating with the SEC with respect to this matter.  We believe we are substantially complete with regard to producing all documents responsive to document requests and a subpoena. The SEC staff has taken testimony from current and/or former officers and/or directors, as well as from third parties, including Deloitte, in this investigation.                             -61-                             In May 2006, we received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.  The subpoena sought documents relating to our granting of stock options.  With the agreement of the Assistant U.S. Attorney, we are responding to the subpoena by producing the documents we produce to the staff of the Division of Enforcement of the SEC.  The U.S. Attorney has also conducted interviews with at least one of our current employees and one of our former employees and with at least one employee of our former independent registered public accounting firm.   We are a nominal defendant in two separate consolidated shareholder derivative actions, one in the Superior Court for the State of Connecticut (the State Court Consolidated Complaint) and the other in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut (the Federal Court Consolidated Complaint). The complaints assert counts for an accounting of stock options granted to certain of the individual defendants and counts against all individual defendants for violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, constructive fraud, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, and breach of contract.   In November 2006, we received a document request from the IRS relating to stock option grants and exercises in connection with the IRS examination of our returns for the years 2001 and 2004. Since certain of these options were granted at a price below the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and have other documentation issues, they do not qualify for Incentive Stock Option tax treatment under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, we have certain tax exposure, as the Company, under former management, did not properly withhold income and payroll taxes. We also have certain tax exposure, under Section 409A, for employee taxes potentially due on option grants made with exercise prices below fair market value on the date of grant. In 2006, we remedied the 409A exposure with respect to directors and executive officers by increasing exercise prices of affected grants.  The remedies that can be taken prior to December 31, 2007 with respect to rank and file employees are currently being evaluated. The overall tax exposure could be significantly higher than the $0.7 million reserve recorded as of December 31, 2005 if the IRS seeks more than the amounts involved in a recently proposed settlement offer for the years 2003 through 2005 and if the IRS does not accept our position on the exercise date for the exercise of options and warrants by certain officers and directors with non-recourse loans.   Due to the fact that we are not current with our SEC reporting obligations, we have not issued shares to employees and directors in connection with the exercise of stock options since July 2005. Certain employees (and former employees) have notified us in writing of their intent to exercise; however, we have not honored such exercises at this time. We may have exposure if our stock price drops after employees have notified us in writing of their intent to exercise. As of December 31, 2005, we had been notified of intents to exercise aggregating 69,492 shares. The range of fair market values for our common stock on the dates of these notifications was from $4.25 to $6.75, with a weighted average fair market value for such shares on the notification dates of $5.60. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2005 of $93,000 based on the closing fair market value of $4.26. During 2006, we were notified of additional intents to exercise aggregating approximately 1.0 million shares. As of December 31, 2006, the cumulative notifications of intents to exercise aggregate approximately 1.1 million shares. The range of fair market values for our common stock on the dates of the cumulative notifications was from $4.20 to $7.10, with a weighted average fair market value for such shares on the notification dates of $5.93. Our potential exposure as of December 31, 2006 for declines in our stock price after such notifications is approximately $70,000 (based on the closing fair market value of $6.30 at December 31, 2006). We may have additional exposure if we cannot settle pending exercises with our stock prior to their expiration. While the final settlement amounts as to pending exercises are unknown, as of March 1, 2007 options for approximately 130,000 shares are beyond their original ten-year life. The intrinsic value of these options on the notification date is approximately $500,000.    As noted separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, we have incurred costs of $3.1 million, $1.3 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relating to the stock option investigation, subpoenas and derivative actions and the related financial restatements, together with an earlier SEC inquiry into former managements accounting for NYFIX Millennium, related litigation and restatement. In addition, we incurred $11.7 million of costs in 2006 related to these matters and will likely incur material amounts going forward. These costs include outside counsels, contract attorneys and forensic accountants, other consultants and the cost of re-auditing previously issued financial statements following the resignation of Deloitte as our independent registered                              -62-                             public accounting firm. These costs do not include any portion of time that our employees have dedicated to these matters.    Other than the amount described above for employee-related taxes for stock options and pending exercises, we have not recorded any liability with respect to these matters, as we are currently unable to predict the outcomes and reasonably estimate the amounts of loss, if any. With respect to the SEC investigation of stock option grants, the grand jury subpoena, the State Court Consolidated Complaint, and the Federal Court Consolidated Complaint associated with such matters and other related matters, we could be subject to penalties, fines or regulatory sanctions or claims by current and former officers, directors or employees for indemnification of costs or losses they may incur and such amounts, individually or collectively, could have a material impact on our financial condition. In addition, other actions may be brought against us related to the matters described above.   Please see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detail description of these matters.   Sale of NYFIX Overseas   During the third quarter of 2006, we committed to a plan to dispose of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of NYFIX Overseas, a wholly-owned subsidiary which previously comprised our OBMS Division.  The transaction closed on August 25, 2006. The initial amount paid by G.L. for the purchase of NYFIX Overseas was $9.0 million. A portion of this amount is expected to be repaid to GL in settlement of a working capital adjustment. There is also an earn-out adjustment, under the terms of which we are eligible for additional earn-out payments based on future revenues of NYFIX Overseas through December 31, 2007.  The maximum earn-out payment is $5.1 million, net of additional payments to the management team of NYFIX Overseas.   We currently estimate recording a net gain on this transaction in excess of $4.0 million. This estimate is preliminary and may be impacted by the outcome of the final working capital adjustment.   The disposition of NYFIX Overseas constitutes a discontinued operation and accordingly our results of operations presented subsequent to the second quarter of 2006 will reflect amounts relative to NYFIX Overseas, except for previously allocated overhead charges, as a discontinued operation on a historical comparative basis.    Revenue and loss before income tax provision of NYFIX Overseas, included in our consolidated financial statements, were as follows for the years ended December 31:                             2005                   2004                   2003                                                                                                          (As Restated - See Note 2)                        (in thousands)              Revenue         $  8,824                    $  9,186                    $  7,128                                                                                                                                              Loss before income tax provision         $    (4,190)                   $    (1,429)                   $    (1,212)                                                                       The loss before income tax provision noted above includes allocated overhead charges from affiliates of $3.9 million, $2.3 million and $1.3 million, for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.                         -63-                                        Overview   We are a pioneer in electronic trading solutions and we continue to transform trading through innovation.  The NYFIX Marketplace   is a global community of trading counterparties utilizing innovative services that optimize the business of trading, including trading workstations, middle office trade automation technologies and trade messaging services.  NYFIX Millennium provides the NYFIX Marketplace   with new methods of accessing liquidity.  We also provide value-added informational and analytic services and powerful tools for measuring execution quality.  As a trusted business partner to Buy-Side and Sell-Side alike, we enable ultra-low touch, low impact market access and end-to-end transaction processing.      We operate businesses that design, produce and sell technology based products and services to professional financial services organizations that are engaged in trading activities including traditional asset management (including the trading of those assets), proprietary trading, and/or the handling of client orders in the U.S. and international securities markets.   Many of our products and services utilize the FIX Protocol which is a messaging standard developed specifically for real-time electronic exchange of securities trading information.     Our innovative NYFIX products and services deliver improvements in speed, quality of execution and cost efficiency by automating both the work flows at the user work station level and the interactive process of transmitting and executing orders between Buy-Side institutional investors (e.g., hedge funds, investment advisers, mutual funds and pension funds) and Sell-Side broker-dealers through exchanges (e.g., NYSE, AMEX, Nasdaq and regional exchanges), the OTC market, ATSs and ECNs.     Business Model   Our revenue is comprised of subscription and maintenance, product sales and services and transaction revenue, as follows:     Subscription and maintenance consists of contracts that provide for the use of our systems and our messaging channels, together with managed services, with a term of generally one to three years.  Additional services, provided under schedules, or addenda to the contracts, are either co-terminus with the original contract or have provisions similar to the original contract.  Under the terms of the subscription contracts and addenda, clients are typically invoiced a flat periodic charge after initial installation and acceptance. Subscription and maintenance also includes maintenance contracts for software under separate, renewable maintenance contracts.  Software related maintenance contracts are generally for a term of one year. Revenue related to these contracts and addenda is recognized over the term of the contract, addendum, or service period, on a straight-line basis.  We include within our subscription and maintenance revenue charges for connectivity to the NYFIX trading community (the NYFIX Marketplace).  These include the various costs of connecting clients which include telecommunications, installation and maintenance of routers, network management software, and staff, and other costs related to the management of connectivity.  The connectivity charges are recognized as the services are provided.   Product sales and services are primarily comprised of software licenses, equipment sales and professional services fees. This revenue is recognized when the software and equipment have been shipped and accepted by the client and when other contractual obligations, including installation, if applicable, have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.     Transaction revenue primarily consists of per-share commissions charged to clients who send and receive a match and execution in our NYFIX Millennium ATS and clients to whom we provide execution and smart order routing technology, gateways to access markets and algorithmic trading ability in: (i) their own name, (ii) a third party name, or (iii) our name. Revenue for these services is generally invoiced monthly in arrears or is obtained through the clearing process within three days of the trade date, and is recognized on a trade date basis, in the period in which it is earned. Transaction revenue also includes the net interest spread on our matched book of securities borrowed/loaned.    Cost of revenue includes the following:                                  Data center operating costs, including salaries, related to equipment, infrastructure                                    -64-                                                   and software supporting operations and the NYFIX Marketplace. TM                                          Managed connectivity costs, including telecommunication and other costs incurred on behalf of clients and costs to maintain the data centers, including depreciation and amortization of assets utilized by the data centers, which are recognized as either a cost of subscription and maintenance or cost of transaction revenue, as appropriate.                                           Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets and capitalized product enhancement costs relating to the applicable revenue category.                                         Developer and quality assurance personnel labor for client and product support of software products.                                        The cost of leased subscription and service bureau equipment, which is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment.  When inventory is leased on a subscription basis, the cost of the inventory is relieved and transferred to property and equipment. The depreciation expense related to this equipment is included in cost of subscription and maintenance revenue.                                        Execution and clearing costs to access various markets and exchanges and to process and settle transactions.

This growth was attributable to an increase in the number of Buy-Side to Sell-Side messaging channels, primarily for order routing, as we continued our efforts to increase the level of business with Buy-Side institutions. Subscriptions (and related managed services) of our OMS Division desktop and floor products were comparable between 2005 and 2004. Recurring maintenance related to prior software sales was comparable between 2005 and 2004 at $6.3 million, reflecting the net effects of an increase related to FIX software products and a decrease related to OBMS software products.     The increase in subscription and maintenance revenue during 2004 was primarily attributable to an increase in subscriptions (and related managed services) of messaging channels offered by our FIX Division. This growth was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of Buy-Side to Sell-Side messaging channels, primarily for order routing, as we continued our efforts to increase the level of business with Buy-Side institutions. Subscriptions (and managed services) of our OMS Division products were comparable between 2004 and 2003, reflecting the net effect of an increase in the subscription of desktop products offset by a decrease in the subscription of floor products. Recurring maintenance related to prior software sales increased $0.8 million from $5.5 million in 2003 to $6.3 million in 2004, primarily related to OBMS Division software products.   Product Sales and Services   The increase in product sales and services during 2005 was primarily due to a one-time sale of hand-held floor application equipment of $0.3 million and an increase in sales of FIX software licenses and related services by our FIX Division, offset in part by a decrease in sales of software licenses and related services by our OBMS Division.   The decrease in product sales and services during 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in sales of FIX software licenses and related services by our FIX Division, offset in part by an increase in sales of software licenses and related services by our OBMS Division.   Transaction   The increase in transaction revenue during 2005 was attributable to an increase in commissions on trade executions and the ramp up of our securities lending business by our Transaction Services Division. Commissions increased $10.6 million to $25.3 million during 2005, compared to $14.7 million during 2004 due primarily to a $6.7 million increase in commissions from Buy-Side clients and a $3.9 million increase in commissions from Sell-Side clients. The increase in commissions from Buy-Side clients resulted from our efforts in 2005 to increase the level of business with these institutions. The increase from Sell-Side clients was due to increased matched volumes in NYFIX Millennium, a full years activity from the NYFIX NEXAS   algorithmic trading products, which were rolled out in the fourth quarter of 2004, and an increase in billed specialist fees. These increased Sell-Side revenues were offset in part by a decline in commissions for direct market access services due to continued price compression. The average daily matched volume in NYFIX Millennium during 2005 was 11.6 million shares, a 68% increase over the average of 6.9 million shares during 2004. Our securities lending business generated net interest spread on its matched book stock borrow/stock loan portfolio of $0.9 million during 2005 compared to $0.1 million during 2004. This increase was due to the hiring of a new sales team in mid-2005.     The increase in transaction revenue during 2004 was primarily attributable to increased commissions by our Transaction Services Division, including a $1.7 million increase in commissions from Buy-Side clients and a $0.2 million increase in commissions from Sell-Side clients. The increase in commissions from Buy-Side clients resulted from our efforts during 2004 to increase the level of business with Buy-Side institutions. The increase in commissions from Sell-Side clients was due to increased matched                              -67-                             volumes in NYFIX Millennium and an increase in billed specialist fees. These increased Sell-Side revenues were offset in part by a decline in commissions for direct market access services due to price compression. The average daily matched volume in NYFIX Millennium during 2004 was 6.9 million shares, a 17% increase over the average of 5.9 million shares during 2003.   Included in the NYFIX Millennium volume figures reported above are conditional orders executed against pass-through orders and other conditional orders, and third market trades crossed by clients and reported by NYFIX Millennium to Nasdaq.   Costs and Expenses    Cost of Revenue   The following table presents cost of revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):               Year ended December 31,     Increase     Year ended December 31,     Increase         2005     2004 (1)     $     %     2004 (1)     2003 (1)     $     %      Subscription and Maintenance               $     31,777          $     27,278          $      4,499               16    .5%     $     27,278          $     23,253          $      4,025               17    .3%     Product Sales and Services          5,304           4,675           629           13    .5%      4,675           3,988           687           17    .2%     Transaction          15,949           10,162           5,787           56    .9%      10,162           8,332           1,830           22    .0%                                     Total cost of revenue        $  53,030         $  42,115         $  10,915           25    .9%    $  42,115         $  35,573         $   6,542           18    .4%                                     Percent of total revenue                     54.3%                56.3%                                           56.3%                53.8%                                                                  (1)  As restated, see Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial           Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         Subscription and Maintenance   The increase in subscription and maintenance cost of revenue during 2005 was primarily attributable to increased telecommunication costs of $1.2 million, an increase in fees paid of $1.0 million to third-party order management system providers to establish messaging channels with their clients, investments in our subscription-based products, including higher personnel costs of $1.7 million and higher amortization of capitalized enhancements of $0.5 million, and increases in other costs. As a percentage of subscription and maintenance revenue, these costs declined to 51% in 2005, compared to 52% in 2004, due in part to the scalability of our infrastructure as revenues grow.   The increase in subscription and maintenance cost of revenue during 2004 was primarily attributable to increased telecommunication costs of $0.7 million, an increase in fees paid of $0.6 million to third-party order management system providers to establish messaging channels with their clients, investments in our subscription-based products, including higher personnel costs of $1.9 million and higher amortization of capitalized enhancements of $0.8 million, and increases in other costs. As a percentage of subscription and maintenance revenue, these costs were flat between 2004 and 2003 at 52% and 52%, respectively.   Product Sales and Services   The increase in product sales and services cost of revenue during 2005 was primarily attributable to investments in our licensed products and services offered, including higher personnel costs of $0.3 million and higher amortization of capitalized enhancement costs of $0.1 million. These costs were also higher in 2005 by $0.2 million related to the cost of equipment inventory sold as described above. As a percentage of product sales and services revenue, these costs were comparable for 2005 and 2004 at 59% and 58%, respectively.                              -68-                             The increase in product sales and services cost of revenue during 2004 was primarily attributable to investments in our licensed products and services offered, including higher personnel costs of $0.3 million and higher amortization of capitalized enhancement costs of $0.4 million. As a percentage of product sales and services revenue, these costs were 58% in 2004, compared to 45% for 2003, reflecting the combined effect of the decline in product sales and services revenue described above and these investments.   Transaction   The increase in transaction cost of revenue during 2005 primarily related to increased execution and clearing fees of $3.1 million associated with the growth in transaction volumes. These costs also increased in 2005 from higher fees of $0.7 million associated with the growth of commission sharing arrangements, losses incurred on trades executed in error of $0.6 million (including a single occurrence of $0.5 million in April 2005) and other costs. As a percentage of transaction revenue, transaction cost of revenue declined to 61% for 2005, compared to 69% for 2004, reflecting the realization of the operating leverage of our self-clearing infrastructure as our revenues grow.    The increase in transaction cost of revenue during 2004 primarily related to increased execution and clearing fees of $0.1 million from the growth in transaction volumes described above, payments associated with commission sharing arrangements (which commenced in 2004) of $0.8 million and investments made to improve our products and our settlement infrastructure, including higher personnel costs of $0.2 million and higher amortization of capitalized enhancement costs of $0.2 million. As a percentage of transaction revenue, transaction cost of revenue was 69% for 2004, compared to 65% for 2003, reflecting the impact of these investments.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)   The following table presents components of our selling, general and administrative expense for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):               Year ended December 31,     Increase (Decrease)     Year ended December 31,     Increase (Decrease)         2005     2004 (1)     $     %     2004 (1)     2003 (1)     $     %      Compensation and Related               $     25,507          $     21,187          $      4,320               20    .4%     $     21,187          $     19,838          $      1,349               6    .8%     Provision for Doubtful Accounts          480           763           (283    )      -37    .1%      763           2,831           (2,068    )      -73    .0%     Occupancy and Related          3,530           4,073           (543    )      -13    .3%      4,073           3,854           219           5    .7%     Marketing, Travel and Entertainment          2,998           2,890           108           3    .7%      2,890           2,536           354           14    .0%     Professional Fees          6,850           5,113           1,737           34    .0%      5,113           3,545           1,568           44    .2%     Research and Development          233           959           (726    )      -75    .7%      959           1,353           (394    )      -29    .1%     Stock-based Compensation          141           525           (384    )      -73    .1%      525           3,545           (3,020    )      -85    .2%     General and Other          5,296           4,511           785           17    .4%      4,511           3,944           567           14    .4%                                     Total SG&A        $  45,035         $  40,021         $   5,014           12    .5%    $  40,021         $  41,446         $  (1,425    )      -3    .4%                                 Percent of total revenue                     46.1%                53.5%                                           53.5%                62.6%                                                                    (1)            As restated, see Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial           Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     Compensation and Related   The increase in the portion of compensation and related costs included in SG&A during 2005 was primarily due to the impact of salary increases, growth in headcount, increased incentive compensation associated with higher revenue levels, increased costs for employee benefits and $0.6 million of severance costs incurred during 2005.    The increase in the portion of compensation and related costs included in SG&A during 2004 was primarily due to a full year of costs from the Renaissance acquisition, which was effective July 1, 2003,                              -69-                             the impact of salary increases and increased costs for employee benefits.    Provision for Doubtful Accounts   The decrease in provision for doubtful accounts during 2005 primarily reflected our efforts to stay more current with receivable balances.   The decrease in provision for doubtful accounts during 2004 primarily reflected the viability concerns we had with certain clients in 2003 with which we had exposures, including independent $2 brokers.   Occupancy and Related   The decrease in occupancy and related costs during 2005 was primarily attributable to the impact of closing an office in lower Manhattan during 2004 and the consolidation of those operations into our 100 Wall Street location. See  Restructuring Charge  below for a discussion of the restructuring charge recorded during 2004 regarding this office closing.   The increase in occupancy and related costs during 2004 was primarily attributable to the impact of additional occupancy costs associated with the Renaissance operations, which were fully acquired and consolidated in the second half of 2003.   Marketing, Travel and Entertainment   The increase in marketing, travel and entertainment expenses during 2005 and 2004 primarily reflected our continued efforts to market and sell our products, including our initiative to increase the level of business we do with Buy-Side institutions and our initial efforts to expand globally.   Professional Fees   The increase in professional fees incurred during 2005 was primarily due to the use of consultants to begin addressing administrative and operational weaknesses and deficiencies and to recast historical results by division in the manner currently used by management. Consultants and outside legal counsels were also engaged to supplement day-to-day management activities while the restatements and related legal issues were being addressed by management. These costs do not include the time spent by outside consultants and advisors on the restatements and related legal issues as such costs have been separately categorized below.    The increase in professional fees incurred during 2004 was primarily due to the use of consultants in connection with the internal control reporting requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.    Research and Development   The reduction in research and development expenses for 2005 and 2004 primarily reflected the increased focus of our software development and quality assurance personnel on enhancing and extending the lives of our existing products.    Stock-based Compensation   The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation for 2005 was primarily attributable to the impact of awards with initial measurement date intrinsic values becoming fully vested in earlier years.   The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation for 2004 was primarily attributable to the impact of awards with initial measurement date intrinsic values becoming fully vested in earlier years and the repayment at the end of 2003 of non-recourse notes issued for the exercise prices of certain awards.                              -70-                             For accounting purposes the awards underlying these notes were considered outstanding and required variable mark-to-market adjustments until the notes were repaid. The 2003 amounts were significantly adjusted in the 2005 Restatement. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.   General and Other   The increase in general and other expenses during 2005 primarily reflected increased costs for temporary administrative help, higher corporate insurance costs and various other general expenses.   The increase in general and other expenses during 2004 primarily reflected higher corporate insurance costs and various other general expenses.    Other Operating Expenses   Other operating expenses consist of the following for the periods indicated (in thousands):           Year ended December 31,     Increase (Decrease)     Year ended December 31,     Increase (Decrease)         2005     2004 (1)     $     2004 (1)     2003 (1)     $      Restatement and SEC Investigation Expenses               $      3,069          $      1,260          $      1,809          $      1,260          $        145          $      1,115          Depreciation and Amortization          2,061           2,304           (243    )      2,304           2,684           (380    )     Restructuring Charge          -           2,527           (2,527    )      2,527           -           2,527          Loss from Equity Affiliate          -           -           -           -           2,153           (2,153    )       (1)  As restated, see Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial           Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.      Restatement and SEC investigation expenses   During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we incurred costs relating to the stock option investigation and subpoenas and the related financial restatements, together with the NYFIX Millennium SEC inquiry, related class action litigation and restatement. These costs include outside counsels, contract attorneys and forensic accountants, other consultants and the cost of re-auditing previously issued financial statements following the resignation of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm. These costs do not include any portion of time that our employees have dedicated to these matters.   The increase during 2005 was due to the significant costs incurred in connection with the SEC investigation into prior stock option grants and the related restatements, including the 2004 Restatement and the initial efforts on the 2005 Restatement.   The increase in 2004 reflects costs incurred on the restatement of results for 1999 through 2002 related to the previous accounting for NYFIX Millennium and the related SEC inquiry and class action litigation.      In addition, we incurred $11.7 million of costs in 2006 related to these matters and related matters, including shareholder derivative litigation, and will likely continue to incur material amounts going forward.    Depreciation and Amortization   The decline in the portion of depreciation and amortization included in SG&A during 2005 and 2004 was due to an increase in the amount of general overhead assets that have become fully depreciated.                             -71-                             Restructuring Charge   The restructuring charge in 2004 was the result of the closing of an office in lower Manhattan and the consolidation of those operations into expanded space at our 100 Wall Street location. This charge reflected the fair value of the remaining rent payments for the closed office, net of sublease income, plus severance costs and write-offs of property and equipment.    We also incurred a restructuring charge of $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2006 relating to the relocation of our corporate headquarters from Stamford, Connecticut to 100 Wall Street. This charge reflected the fair value of the remaining rent payments for the closed office, net of sublease income, plus real estate commissions, leasehold improvements for the subtenant, employee relocation and severance costs, moving costs and write-offs of property and equipment.    We believe these consolidations of our office space will provide for substantial operational efficiencies as we better centralize our administrative and management functions across our entire organization.   Loss from Equity Affiliate   The loss from equity affiliate in 2003 represents 100% of the losses incurred by Renaissance prior to our full acquisition effective July 1, 2003. Prior to the 2005 Restatement, we only recorded 18% of these losses based on our then outstanding voting interest. We determined in the 2005 Restatement that because of loans and advances we made to Renaissance and the lack of recorded value attributable to the other members equity interests, we should have absorbed all of Renaissances losses during this period.    We also determined in the 2005 Restatement that the operations of EuroLink should have been consolidated in our results and should not have been presented in loss from equity affiliate based on our 40% as converted voting interest through the full acquisition in March 2002 as previously reported. Since there was no recorded value attributable to the other shareholders minority interests during the reporting periods, we absorbed 100% of these losses in our consolidated operations.    See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details of the 2005 Restatement.   Non-Operating Income (Expense)   Non-operating income (expense) items are as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):           Year ended December 31,     Increase (Decrease)     Year ended December 31,     Increase (Decrease)         2005     2004 (1)     $     2004 (1)     2003 (1)     $      Interest Expense               $     (728    )     $     (801    )     $      (73    )     $     (801    )     $     (187    )     $      614          Investment income          267           141           126           141           612           (471    )     Other (expense) income, net          (189    )      (99    )      90           (99    )      74           173             (1)               As restated, see Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial           Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     Interest expense    The decrease in 2005 was primarily attributable to decreases in interest expense on sales tax obligations and on reduced acquisition related notes outstanding, which also incurred accelerated interest in 2004 as a result of defaults relating to SEC reporting obligations. These decreases were partially offset                              -72-                             by an increase in 2005 of $0.4 million associated with the 7.5% convertible note issued on December 30, 2004.     The increase in 2004 was primarily attributable to interest expense associated with sales tax obligations and on acquisition notes due to higher average outstanding principal balances during the year and accelerated interest as a result of defaults relating to SEC reporting obligations.    In 2006, we incurred additional interest of $0.3 million associated with the shares underlying the $7.5 million convertible note not being registered.   Investment Income   The increase in 2005 reflected higher average cash balances invested during the year.    The decrease in 2004 reflected lower average cash balances invested during the year.   Other Income (Expense), Net   The change in the net expense in 2005 was primarily due to the write-off of deferred financing costs of $0.2 million associated with the deemed debt extinguishment of the $7.5 million convertible note from the conversion price reduction in June 2005.   The change in the net expense in 2004 was primarily due to the loss of $0.1 million on the repayment of certain Renaissance notes.    Income Tax Provision    The income tax provisions for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were solely attributable to the impact of deducting goodwill with the Renaissance acquisition in our tax filings. All other tax effects during 2005, 2004 and 2003 have been netted out in our deferred tax asset valuation reflecting our view that historical pre-tax book income and historical income for tax purposes are not sufficient to support a conclusion that the value of our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Until we achieve and sustain an appropriate level of profitability, we plan to maintain a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets.    2005 and 2004 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information   The following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations quarterly trend information for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2005.

The use of consultants and outside counsels also increased during this period to supplement day-to-day management activities while the restatement and related legal issues were being addressed by management.                                            Restatement and SEC investigation expenses increased significantly during the quarter ended December 31, 2005 as a result of the commencement of our extensive document review in connection with the SECs investigation into our stock option practices under the oversight of the Subcommittee.  This document review was a necessary step in completing our review of the accounting of historical stock-based compensation awards, which was conducted by management under the oversight of the Audit Committee and the Subcommittee.                                        -74-                              Liquidity and Capital Resources                                      Years Ended December 31,              (in thousands)                   2005                   2004                   2003                                                                                      Cash and cash equivalents         $         21,066         $         24,764         $         21,404              Short-term investments                   500                   1,175                   3,050                                                                                      Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments         $         21,566         $         25,939         $         24,454                                                                                                                                                                 Net cash provided by operating activities         $         4,571         $         6,901         $         13,860              Net cash used in investing activities                   (7,534)                   (10,596)                   (4,762)              Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities                   (297)                   7,439                   199              Effect of exchange rate changes on cash                   (438)                   (384)                   31                                                                                      Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents         $         (3,698)         $         3,360         $         9,328                                                                                        Liquidity   We derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations, and from long-term borrowings.  We continue to generate positive operating cash flows and use cash generated from operations for capital expenditures and product enhancements. Our resources available at December 31, 2005, together with the cash generated from operations in 2006 and our investment and financing activities during 2006, were sufficient to finance our investing and operating needs and the net capital requirements of our broker-dealer subsidiaries for 2006. At December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $105.9 million.  We also believe that our current resources, together with anticipated cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our current investing and operating needs. At December 31, 2005, $18.4 million of our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in our broker-dealer subsidiaries to maintain the combined amount of $3.7 million of excess regulatory capital described below under  Broker-Dealer Operations .   In December 2006 we infused an additional $12.5 million of cash into our broker-dealer subsidiaries to provide additional excess regulatory capital to allow for business expansion and to provide our broker-dealer transaction counterparties with a better capitalized business partner.    Operating Activities   The following table sets forth our net loss adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation, amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation and equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates; and the effect on cash generated by operating activities of changes in working capital and other operating accounts between years.                                                Years Ended December 31,              (in thousands)                   2005                   2004                   2003                                                                                      Net loss adjusted for non-cash items         $         8,763          $         4,126          $         6,211               Effect of changes in working capital and other operating accounts                   (4,192)                   2,775                    7,649                                                                                       Net cash provided by operating activities         $         4,571          $         6,901          $         13,860                                                                                          Broker-Dealer Operations       Clearing broker assets reflect amounts on hand to support our ability to self-clear the transactions of NYFIX Millennium and NYFIX Transaction Services, such as receivables from clearing organizations and deposits with clearing firms, as well as balances to support our matched-book stock borrow/stock                              -75-                             loan business. Our matched-book balances include offsetting stock borrowed and stock loaned and offsetting securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive. At December 31, 2005, the net balance for clearing broker assets and clearing broker liabilities was a net liability of $0.3 million.   Securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral provided for securities borrowed transactions and received for securities loaned transactions, plus accrued interest. We monitor the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary. At December 31, 2005, clearing broker assets include stock borrows of $454.1 million and clearing broker liabilities include stock loans of $456.4 million. These balances are significantly higher than the balances at December 31, 2004 reflecting our ability to grow this business. This business and the related balances continued to grow in 2006 and we expect further growth in 2007 as a result of the $12.5 million capital infusion described above under  Liquidity .    NYFIX Millennium, NYFIX Transaction and NYFIX Clearing are U.S. registered broker-dealers required to maintain levels of regulatory net capital under Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act. NYFIX Clearings DTCC membership, used to self-clear securities transactions, requires it to maintain $10 million in excess of its required net capital. Until July 2006, NYFIX International was registered as an ISD Category C firm with the FSA, required to maintain financial resources generally equal to three months average expenditures, subject to a minimum of 50,000, plus a proportion of less liquid assets on hand. In July 2006, NYFIX International became an ISD Category B registered firm and as a result is required to maintain financial resources generally equal to three months average expenditures, subject to a minimum of 125,000, plus a proportion of less liquid assets on hand. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate regulatory net capital/resources of our regulated subsidiaries in the U.S. and U.K. was $14.9 million, $3.7 million in excess of our aggregate requirement of $11.2 million (including the $10 million excess required by DTCC).    Investing Activities   Investments in current technology to maintain our infrastructure and to enhance our products remain an important requirement for our available cash resources.    Net cash used in investing activities in 2005 was $7.5 million.  This consisted primarily of capital expenditures for property and equipment, principally for data center equipment and software, of $3.7 million and product enhancement costs of $4.6 million. These amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the net sales of short-term investments of $0.7 million.       Net cash used in investing activities in 2004 was $10.6 million.  This consisted of capital expenditures, primarily for data center equipment and software, of $6.7 million, and product enhancement costs of $6.5 million. These amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the net sales of short-term investments of $1.3 million and by cash acquired from acquisitions of $1.2 million, which represented a return of funds held in escrow pursuant to a settlement agreement with a representative of the former shareholders of Javelin.   Net cash used in investing activities in 2003 was $4.8 million.  This consisted primarily of capital expenditures for property and equipment, principally for data center equipment and software, of $5.3 million, product enhancement costs of $5.4 million and loans and advances to unconsolidated affiliates of $2.5 million. These amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the net sales of short-term investments of $8.5 million.    The sale of our NYFIX Overseas subsidiary in August 2006 generated $9.0 million of proceeds. Upon resolution of the working capital adjustment a portion of these proceeds are expected to be returned to the buyer. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details of this transaction.                               -76-                             Financing Activities    Our financing activities primarily consist of long-term debt issued for acquisitions, capital lease obligations used for equipment purchases and long-term debt issued for working capital purposes. At December 31, 2005, we had long-term debt and capital lease obligations outstanding of $7.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively (including current portions).    At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding a $7.5 million convertible note with an interest rate of 5%, due in December 2009.  This note was issued in December 2004 through a private placement to a lender.  As a result of the restatements of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, we were in breach of certain representations and warranties relating to those financial statements that constituted events of default under this note.  This note was amended on June 24, 2005, at which time the lender waived all existing defaults, extended the requirement to have a registration statement be effective for the shares of our common stock that may be issued as payment of principal or interest and the conversion price was reduced (as amended, the Convertible Note).    The interest is payable in cash or, at our option as described below, by the issuance of shares of our common stock, semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, beginning June 30, 2005.     The Convertible Note is subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness. The lender has certain rights that require us to register the common stock to be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Note or for payment of interest, under the Securities Act.  Such registration statement was to be effective by March 31, 2006 and since it was not, we are required to pay additional interest, in cash, for each month the effectiveness is delayed. The additional interest varies by month and has an aggregate cap of $500,000 for the duration of the Convertible Note. We paid $338,000 of such additional interest in 2006.      The entire outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Note, together with all accrued but unpaid interest, is due in cash on December 30, 2009; and except under certain conditions, we have no right of early prepayment on the Convertible Note.     In exchange for the amendment described above, we agreed to reduce the price at which the lender can convert the Convertible Note into our common stock from $6.94 per share to $5.75 per share (the Conversion Price), a 16% premium over the average of our common stock closing price for the five trading days preceding June 24, 2005.   At our option, the Convertible Note is convertible into our common stock at the lenders conversion rate at any time provided our common stock has exceeded 150% of the Conversion Price, or $8.63 per common share, for at least ten trading days in the thirty day trading period ending within five trading days prior to the date we give notice of the conversion and provided that we have an effective registration statement covering the public resale of such shares.  If we convert the Convertible Note prior to December 30, 2007, we are required to pay an additional make-whole interest payment equal to the present value of the remaining interest payments in either cash or our stock at our discretion.    The Conversion Price may be reduced if we issue shares of common stock at a price below $5.75, excluding stock option exercises, the settlement of obligations outstanding as of the date of the Convertible Note and other transactions previously approved by our Board of Directors. As a result of the private placement of common shares that closed in July 2006 (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the Conversion Price was reduced to approximately $5.66.    If we issue our common stock in lieu of cash to convert the Convertible Note or to make interest payments, or any portion thereof, we are required to have an effective registration statement covering the public resale of such shares and pay a 5% premium based on an average of the closing price of our common stock for the previous ten trading days.                               -77-                             At the option of the lender, we may issue to the lender up to an additional $2.5 million note under terms substantially similar to those described above. The lender has received an extension to close on this additional issuance until fourteen days after the date on which we file this report on Form 10-K.    Net cash used in financing activities in 2005 was $0.3 million, consisting primarily of principal payments under capital lease obligations of $0.6 million and payments under long-term borrowings of $0.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options by employees of $0.1 million and other long-term obligations of $0.3 million.  In 2006, we repaid long-term borrowings of $0.3 million (by issuing our stock) and the principal value of capital lease obligations of $0.8 million.       Net cash provided by financing activities in 2004 was $7.4 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from long-term borrowings of $7.2 million and proceeds of $0.4 million from the issuance of common stock resulting from the exercise of stock options and other long-term obligations of $0.4 million, offset by principal payments under capital lease obligations of $0.6 million.   Net cash provided by financing activities in 2003 was $0.2 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting from the exercise of stock options by employees of $0.8 million and repayments of notes receivable issued for common stock of $0.5 million, offset in part by payments under capital lease obligations of $1.1 million.     As more fully described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2006 we issued shares of common stock and convertible preferred stock during 2006 in two separate private placement transactions. We issued 2.7 million shares of common stock for $12.7 million to clients of a large investment manager (plus an additional 0.2 million shares for placement agent fees), and 1.5 million shares of convertible preferred stock to Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX, L.P. for $75 million (less $5.8 million of transaction related expenses). The proceeds from these transactions are intended for general corporate purposes and business development activities.    Nasdaq Delisting Proceeding   On October 12, 2005, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel determined to continue the listing of our securities on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to our filing of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2005, on or before October 31, 2005. As a result of additional questions raised during the ongoing SEC investigation into our accounting for stock option grants (see Notes 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), these filings were not made by October 31, 2005 and our common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq National Market on November 1, 2005. As a result of this delisting, our common stock is currently traded in the OTC securities market with real-time quotes available on the Pink Sheets electronic quotation service using the symbol NYFX.    Commitments, Contingencies and Future Obligations    Commitments and Contingencies       There are various lawsuits and claims pending against us as well as ongoing SEC and United States Attorneys Office investigations into our accounting for stock option grants and an SEC investigation into our accounting for the losses incurred by NYFIX Millennium. We are currently unable to predict the outcomes and reasonably estimate the amounts of loss, if any, with respect to these matters. With respect to certain of these matters, we could be subject to penalties, fines or regulatory sanctions or claims by current and former officers, directors or employees for indemnification of costs or losses they may incur                              -78-                             and such amounts, individually or collectively, could have a material impact on our financial condition. In addition, other actions may be brought against us related to these matters.    See also Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    Future Obligations    The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations at December 31, 2005, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Additional disclosures relating to our long-term debt, capital lease obligations and commitments appear in Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.            Contractual Obligations        Payments due by period         Total         Less than  1 year       1-3 years       3-5 years       More than  5 years           (in thousands)     Long-term debt               $      7,952          $        259          $        193          $      7,500          $      -          Capital lease obligations          1,763           769           994           -           -          Operating leases          25,804           4,695           8,715           5,170           7,224          Other long-term obligations          1,006           894           112           -           -          Purchase obligations          4,849           2,759           1,786           304           -                                 Total        $  41,374         $   9,376         $  11,800         $  12,974         $   7,224                                                            Long-term debt consists of payments on promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions and the Convertible Note, described above.  Under the terms of the long-term debt instruments, we may elect to make payments in shares of our common stock instead of cash, which would reduce the amounts shown above and lessen the effect on liquidity and cash flows.                                    Operating lease obligations include minimum lease obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year primarily related to office and data center space as well as certain equipment.                                    Purchase obligations include minimum purchase obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year to certain telecommunication providers in exchange for pricing discounts and a software licensing arrangement with a minimum licensing fee.             Seasonality and Inflation   We believe that our operations have not been significantly affected by seasonality or inflation.   Off-balance Sheet Arrangements   We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements other than that related to the contingent obligation under the $7.5 million Convertible Note as described above.   Subsequent Events    For more information regarding events occurring after December 31, 2005, refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis                              -79-                             for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes the accounting estimates described in the following narrative to be the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed the accounting policies and critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our independent registered public accounting firm and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following narrative describes the critical accounting policies and estimates, the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions.   Revenue Recognition   We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.  We recognize revenue from software arrangements in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2,  Software Revenue Recognition,  as amended,   under which revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred, collectibility is reasonably assured and the arrangement does not require significant customization or modification of the software.     Our revenue is comprised of subscription and maintenance, product sales and services and transaction revenue, as follows:     Subscription and maintenance consists of contracts that provide for the use of our systems and our messaging channels, together with managed services, with a term of generally one to three years.  Additional services, provided under schedules, or addenda to the contracts, are either co-terminus with the original contract or have provisions similar to the original contract.  Under the terms of the subscription contracts and addenda, clients are typically invoiced a flat periodic charge after initial installation and acceptance. Subscription and maintenance also includes maintenance contracts for software, under separate renewable maintenance contracts. Software related maintenance contracts are generally for a term of one year. Revenue related to these contracts and addenda is recognized over the term of the contract, addendum, or service period, on a straight-line basis.  We include within our subscription and maintenance revenue charges for connectivity to the NYFIX Marketplace. These include the various costs of connecting clients which include telecommunications, installation and maintenance of routers, network management software, and staff, and other costs related to the management of connectivity.  The connectivity charges are recognized as the services are provided.     Product sales and services are primarily comprised of software licenses, equipment sales and professional services fees. This revenue is recognized when the software and equipment have been shipped and accepted by the client and when other contractual obligations, including installation, if applicable, have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.     Transaction revenue primarily consists of per-share commissions charged to clients who send and receive a match and execution in our NYFIX Millennium ATS and clients to whom we provide execution and smart order routing technology, gateways to access markets and algorithmic trading ability in: (i) their own name, (ii) a third party name, or (iii) our name. Revenue for these services is generally invoiced monthly in arrears or is obtained through the clearing process within three days of the trade date and is recognized on a trade date basis, in the period in which it is earned. Transaction revenue also includes the net interest spread on our matched book of securities borrowed/loaned.     Amounts invoiced in advance of the service being performed are deferred until earned and are included in deferred revenue.  Shipping, handling and installation charges, if any, are generally invoiced to a client and are included in revenue upon completion of the installation.                             -80-                             Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   We are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables and a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of receivables, including the current credit-worthiness of each client.  Allowances are established for those amounts that we believe are uncollectible due to the inability of clients to make required payments or because of billing adjustments. These allowances are estimated by considering a number of factors, including the length of time the accounts are past due, our previous loss history, the clients current ability to pay its obligations and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole.  If circumstances change (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major clients ability to meet its financial obligations to us), our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount.     Property and Equipment   Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the assets economic lives or the lease term.   Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates.  In those cases where we determine that the useful life of long-lived asset should be revised, we depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life.    Acquisitions and Goodwill   Net assets of companies we acquired have been recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in an acquisition. In accordance with SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,  we perform an impairment review of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances change. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 require that we allocate our goodwill to our various reporting units, determine the carrying value of those businesses, and estimate the fair value of the reporting units so that a two-step goodwill impairment test can be performed.  Our reporting units represent components of our operating segments and are the same as the reportable segments identified in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The two-step impairment review process is as follows:                                                 Step 1We compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value, including goodwill, of each of these units. For each reporting unit where the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the units fair value, we move on to Step 2. If the units fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment expense is necessary.                                                      Step 2If we determine in Step 1 that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non-goodwill intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. This results in an implied fair value for the reporting units goodwill. We then compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.             In the absence of circumstances requiring impairment testing on a quarterly or other more frequent basis, our annual impairment testing date is the beginning of our fourth quarter, which is October 1.  For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there was no indication of impairment for any of our                              -81-                             reporting units as the present value of the discounted future cash flows of each reporting unit with allocated goodwill exceeded their carrying values as of October 1st of each respective year, the date of our annual impairment analysis. Fair value assessments inherently involve estimates and judgments involving the amount and timing of cash flows that could materially differ with changes in circumstances.   Product Enhancement Costs   Costs incurred in the research, design and development of software for sale to others as a separate product or embedded in a product and sold as part of the product as a whole are charged to expense until technological feasibility is established.  Thereafter, software development costs, consisting primarily of payroll and related costs, purchased materials and services and software to be used within our products, which significantly enhance the marketability or significantly extend the life of our products are capitalized, and amortized to cost of revenue on a straight-line basis over three years, beginning when the products are offered for sale or when the enhancements are integrated into the product.  We are required to use professional judgment in determining whether product enhancement costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization, in accordance with SFAS No. 86,  Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.     Long-Lived Assets   We review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including property and equipment; intangible assets; investments, and capitalized product enhancement costs for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. If such an event or circumstances occur, the related estimated fair value of the assets would be compared to the carrying amount, and if needed, we would record an impairment to the extent by which the carrying amount exceeded the fair value of the assets.  We test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value methodology such as discounted cash flows.  There was no impairment of our long-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.  Fair value assessments inherently involve estimates and judgments involving the amount and timing of cash flows that could materially differ with changes in circumstances.   Income Taxes    We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed in SFAS No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes  (SFAS No. 109).  SFAS 109 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the recognition of tax effects for financial statement and income tax reporting purposes by applying enacted income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets to only that portion that is judged more likely than not to be realized.  Where there are cumulative losses in recent years, SFAS No. 109 requires, except in very limited circumstances, that a valuation allowance be established.  We began establishing a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, since inception (as restated - see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Until we can achieve and sustain an appropriate level of profitability, we plan to maintain a valuation allowance on the realizable value of our net deferred tax assets.     Contingencies   Contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Disclosure is required when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred or that the ultimate loss may exceed the recorded provision. We use outside counsel to assist us in various matters including regulations, acquisitions, trademark, patent,                              -82-                             personnel and other matters.  We rely on the professional judgment of outside counsel as well as our own assessment in determining whether contingencies should be recorded.   Stock-Based Compensation    We account for stock-based compensation for employees under the recognition and measurement provisions of the Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees  (APB No. 25), and related interpretations and have elected the disclosure-only alternative under SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation .  Stock-based compensation expense of $0.2 million, $0.6 million and $3.7 million was included in our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relating to the intrinsic value of certain stock options where the fair value of our common stock on the measurement date was in excess of the exercise price.  In accordance with SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure , we have disclosed the required pro forma information in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   With respect to certain awards, we have been confronted with various situations under which the required factual documentation necessary to determine measurement criteria was either inconsistent, incomplete or could not be located, and other situations relating to the validity and/or authorization of the grant. In these situations, our treatment is consistent with the SEC Staff guidance to industry dated September 19, 2006.    For instances where there are issues as to validity and/or authorization of grants, we have accounted for such awards as fixed options using as the measurement date the date that we have determined to be the date on which the terms and recipients were established with finality.   For instances where we have difficulty locating documentation to determine precisely the first date on which both the number of shares and exercise prices were known, we have determined measurement dates based upon the documentation available as to when the grants were included in our books and records or using assumptions based on the historical documentation on other grants with similar characteristics. These determinations require significant judgments.   Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a number of judgments made in determining initial measurement dates and dates of modifications for equity-based awards together with the outcomes if other judgments had been made.   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,  Fair Value Measurements  (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. SFAS 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We will adopt SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008 and anticipate that the adoption will not materially impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations.    In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109  (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires that entities recognize in their financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning                              -83-                             after December 15, 2006. We will adopt FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 and anticipate that the adoption will not materially impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,  Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments  (SFAS 155). SFAS 155 is an amendment of SFAS No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  (SFAS 133) and SFAS No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities  (SFAS 140) and allows companies to elect to measure at fair value entire financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would otherwise have to be accounted for separately. SFAS 155 also requires companies to identify interest in securitized financial assets that are freestanding derivatives or contain embedded derivatives that would have to be accounted for separately, clarifies which interest- and principal-only strips are subject to SFAS 133, and amends SFAS 140 to revise the conditions of a qualifying special purpose entity due to the new requirement to identify whether interests in securitized financial assets are freestanding derivatives or contain embedded derivatives. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. We will adopt SFAS 155 on January 1, 2007 and anticipate that the adoption will not materially impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations.    In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections  (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20,  Accounting Changes , and SFAS No. 3,  Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements , and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions.  SFAS 154 requires retrospective application, as defined therein, to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change.  SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.    In 2005, the SEC issued phased-in implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payments  (SFAS 123 (R)). SFAS 123(R) is a revision of SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25 and its related implementation guidance. SFAS 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity for goods or services.  It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.  SFAS 123(R) focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.  In accordance with that guidance, we will adopt SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006.  We expect the impact of adopting SAB 107 (defined below) and SFAS 123(R) to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107,  Share-Based Payment  (SAB 107).  SAB 107 expresses the SEC Staffs views regarding the interaction between SFAS 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides the Staffs views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. In particular, SAB 107 provides guidance related to share-based payment transactions with non-employees, the transition from nonpublic to public entity status, valuation methods (including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term), the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share-based payment arrangements, the classification of compensation expense, non-GAAP financial measures, first time adoption of SFAS 123(R) in an interim period, capitalization of compensation cost related to share-based payment arrangements, the accounting for income tax effects of share-based payment arrangements upon adoption of SFAS 123(R) and the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of SFAS 123(R).                              -84-                             Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may be expected to result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in credit ratings of the issuer, equity prices, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.     Interest Rates    Our long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates. Consequently, we do not believe we are currently exposed to any material interest rate or market risk in connection with our long-term debt.    Foreign Currency Risk    Our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared with foreign currencies, which are primarily the British pound and the Euro, due to our operations in the United Kingdom and Europe.    We manage foreign currency risk through the structure of our business. In the substantial majority of our transactions, we receive payments denominated in the U.S. dollar, British pounds sterling or the Euro. Therefore, we do not rely on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid according to our standard payment terms, which are generally short-term in nature.    Securities Market and Credit Risk   NYFIX Clearing is subject to market risk when a counterparty does not deliver cash or securities to it as expected and NYFIX Clearing holds cash (in lieu of securities) or securities (in lieu of cash) at any point in time.  This risk arises from the potential inability of the counterpartys clearing agent to meet its settlement obligation by delivering cash or securities, as required, which is a credit risk.  NYFIX Clearing is a member of several highly rated clearing organizations, which have margin requirements and other mechanisms that are designed to substantially mitigate this risk.   When necessary, NYFIX Clearing can liquidate or purchase securities in the market to close out the position at the prevailing market price.  NYFIX Clearings stock lending practice is to maintain collateral in excess of the contract value and to request additional collateral whenever necessary.
