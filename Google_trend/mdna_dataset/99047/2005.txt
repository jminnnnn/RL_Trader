ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS        The  purpose  of  management's  discussion  and  analysis  of  financialcondition and results of operations ("MD&A") is to provide an overview of NYFIX,Inc. to help facilitate an understanding of the significant  factors influencingour consolidated financial statements and also to convey our expectations of thepotential impact of known trends,  events, or uncertainties  that may impact ourfuture  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our MD&A includes  forward-lookingstatements,  including, without limitation, our expectations. Our actual resultsmay differ  materially  from those  expressed or implied in the  forward-lookingstatements as a result of various factors  including,  but not limited to, thosediscussed  under "Risk  Factors  Relating to Our Business"  below.  We assume noobligation to update the  forward-looking  statements or such risk factors.  Youshould read this  discussion  in  conjunction  with our  consolidated  financialstatements and related notes included in this Report on Form 10-K.        The following discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement ofour  consolidated  financial  statements to correctly  account for  compensationexpense attributable to stock options granted to our employees and directors andto correctly account for deferred tax assets and liabilities  related to certainacquisitions, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.OVERVIEW        NYFIX,   founded  in  1991  through  the   acquisition  of  a  New  Yorkcorporation,  is  headquartered in Stamford,  Connecticut.  In December 2003, wereincorporated as a Delaware corporation.        We are a provider to the domestic and international financial markets oftrading  workstations,  middle-office  trade  automation  technologies and tradecommunication  technologies.  Our NYFIX Network is one of the industry's largestnetworks, connecting broker-dealers,  institutions and exchanges. In addition toour  headquarters in Stamford,  we have offices on Wall Street in New York City,in London's Financial  District,  in Chicago, in San Francisco and in Madrid. Weoperate  redundant  data  centers in the  northeastern  US and have  establishedadditional data center hubs in London, Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Tokyo.        We are a provider of trading technology,  industry network  connectivityand execution  services,  offering certain  underlying,  universally  applicablenetwork  inter-connectivity   products,  systems,   facilities,  and  supportingoperations to our two business segments: our Technology Services segment and ourTransaction  Services segment.  These segments,  in turn, package these productsand services and add others to address the needs of their specific  markets.  Wealso  provide to our  segments  products  specifically  developed to support themarketing  strategy of that segment.  We provide  product  development,  systemsdevelopment, data center and network operations support to our segments.        Our   Technology   Services   segment  is   comprised  of  four  of  oursubsidiaries:  NYFIX  USA,  NYFIX  Overseas,  Javelin,  and  Renaissance.  Thesebusinesses  work  together  as  technology   providers,   focusing  on  offeringtrade-management   systems,  a  centralized  industry   order-routing   network,order-routing software,  exchange-floor  automation systems, exchange and marketaccess technology and post-trade  processing  systems.  Our Technology  Servicescustomers consist  primarily of US securities  brokerage firms and internationalderivatives   brokerage  firms.  Our  Technology   Services  segment   generatessubscription, capital sale and service revenue.        Our Transaction Services segment is comprised of six of our subsidiaries- - NYFIX Millennium,  NYFIX Transaction Services,  and NYFIX Clearing,  which areNASD  registered   broker-dealers;   NYFIX  Partners,  which  was  approved  formembership  in the  NFA  in  2002,  is our  Introducing  Broker  for  derivativetransactions; NYFIX International,  which was incorporated in the United Kingdom                                       37                                    NYFIX, INC.on March 29, 2004,  is a  broker-dealer  registered  with the FSA  broker-dealerlicense in connection  with our expansion into European and other  internationalmarkets; and EuroLink. We acquired the remaining 60% of EuroLink we did not own,effective  March 29,  2004.  We have  integrated  EuroLink's  operations,  whichrepresented our initial transaction efforts in the European markets,  into NYFIXInternational.        NYFIX Millennium provides a modernized  electronic execution venue underRegulation ATS for trading in US stocks.  NYFIX  Transaction  Services  providestechnology  and direct market  access and execution  links.  NYFIX  Clearing,  amember  of the  DTCC,  settles  and  clears  transactions  on  behalf  of  NYFIXMillennium  and  NYFIX  Transaction  Services.  While  NYFIX  Partners  has  notinitiated any active business,  we are discussing  opportunities with sponsoringbroker-dealers  and potential  customers for the derivatives  markets to augmentour future business plans.        Our main  growth  strategy,  based  on our  established  technology  andinvestments  in new  technologies  and market  segments,  is to respond to thesemarket  developments  with a unified packaging of our NYFIX Network as a "globalutility." We offer  products  that are  designed to address the  above-describedneeds while providing automatic and seamless unification of the data-elements oftrade-management,   trade-routing,   market   access,   computerized   executionenhancements and real-time transaction statistics.        For our traditional  Technology Service segment, we see our strategy for2005 as effectively managing our customer base. While we see limited opportunityfor revenue growth,  we believe that we have the opportunity to generate profitsand maintain this strategically  important component of our overall product mix.We believe we can  maintain  our  position as a leading  provider of  technologysolutions.  While  the  market  continues  to  change,  our  goal is to focus on"quality" revenue and enhanced profitability.        In recent years, we have invested heavily in pursuing a  growth-orientedstrategy and have  organized  those efforts  largely  through our  subsidiaries.After the  introduction  of our NYFIX Network in 1998,  although we  experiencedquarter over quarter  revenue  growth from 1999 through 2001, we also  generatedoperating losses.  Thereafter, as a result of the impact of the tragic events ofSeptember 11, 2001 on our customer base, the downturn in the financial  markets,and the  fixed-cost  base of our  acquired  companies  we have not been  able togenerate sufficient revenue to offset our operating costs and, thus, experiencedoperating  losses  through  2004.  We believe  that our  decision to continue toinvest  during the last  three  years is an  important  factor to help us becomebetter positioned to take advantage of future opportunities. We have entered newcustomer  market  segments,  launched  new products and continue to pursue otheropportunities to support trading for a variety of financial  instruments in moremarkets while increasing our international business opportunities.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES        This MD&A reviews our consolidated financial statements, which have beenprepared in accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in theUnited States of America. These principles require us to make estimates based onassumptions,  which, if not accurate,  could materially  affect our consolidatedfinancial statements, including the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense andthe  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of theconsolidated financial statements and future reporting periods.        Estimates,  including  assumptions  related  to: the  collectibility  ofaccounts  receivable;  the useful lives of tangible and intangible  assets;  therecoverability  of goodwill;  the  realization  of deferred tax assets;  revenuerecognition;  product  enhancement  costs;  income taxes; and  contingencies arereviewed  periodically  and  the  effects  of  revisions  are  reflected  in theconsolidated  financial  statements  in the  period  they are  determined  to benecessary.  We base our estimates on historical  experience and on various otherfactors and assumptions that we consider to be reasonable,  the results of whichform the basis for making estimates and assumptions about the carrying values of                                       38                                    NYFIX, INC.assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actualresults may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions.        We believe  the  accounting  policies  described  below are  critical tounderstanding  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  Refer to Note 1 to theConsolidated Financial Statements for our significant accounting policies.REVENUE RECOGNITION        We  recognize  revenue in  accordance  with the SEC's  Staff  AccountingBulletin  ("SAB") No. 101,  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  IN  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS,  asamended by SAB 101A and 101B ("SAB 101") and SAB 104, REVENUE  RECOGNITION.  SAB101  requires  that  four  basic  criteria  must be met  before  revenue  can berecognized:  (1) persuasive  evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery hasoccurred or services have been rendered;  (3) the fee is fixed and determinable;and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.  Determination of criteria (3) and(4) are based on our judgment  regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged forproducts  delivered  and the  collectibility  of those fees.  Should  changes inconditions  cause us to determine  these criteria are not met for certain futuretransactions,  revenue  recognized  for any reporting  period could be adverselyimpacted.        We recognize  revenue from  software  arrangements  in  accordance  withAmerican  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants'  Statement  of Position("SOP") 97-2, SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION as amended by SOP 98-9,  MODIFICATIONOF SOP 97-2 WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN  TRANSACTIONS.  Revenue is  recognized  whenpersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred, providedthe fee is fixed or determinable, collectibility is probable and the arrangementdoes not require significant customization or modification of the software.        We recognize revenue for contracts with multiple deliverables, which arenot  covered  under  SOP  97-2,  in  accordance  with the  Financial  AccountingStandards  Board's  ("FASB")  Emerging  Issues Task Force 00-21,  ACCOUNTING FORREVENUE  ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE  DELIVERABLES  ("EITF No. 00-21").  EITF No.00-21  applies to  certain  contractually  binding  arrangements  under  which acompany performs  multiple revenue  generating  activities and requires that allcompanies   account  for  each  element  within  an  arrangement  with  multipledeliverables as separate units of accounting if (a) the delivered item has valueon a stand-alone  basis,  (b) there is objective  and reliable  evidence of fairvalue and (c) the amount of the total  arrangement  consideration is fixed. EITFNo.  00-21 was  effective  for revenue  arrangements  entered  into in reportingperiods  beginning  after June 15, 2003 and was adopted by us effective  July 1,2003.        Our  revenue  is  comprised  of  subscription,   capital  sale,  servicecontract, and transaction components, described as follows:        Subscription  revenue  contracts are  primarily  with  brokerage  firms,international banks and global exchanges trading in equities and/or derivatives.Subscription  revenue contracts are for providing equipment and services and foruse of our NYFIX  Network,  with an initial term of generally one to three yearswith  automatic  renewal  periods  unless we  receive  prior  written  notice ofcancellation. Additional services, provided under schedules, or addendums to thecontract,  are either  co-terminus with the original contract or have provisionssimilar to the original contract.  Under the terms of the subscription contractsand addendums,  customers  typically  contract for a flat periodic  charge afterinitial  installation and acceptance.  The revenue related to these contracts isrecognized over the term of the contract, or addendum, on a straight-line basis.We also include  within our  subscription  revenue  telecommunication  and othercharges,  which we provide to the  customer at cost plus a normal  profit.  Suchrevenue is  recognized  as the services are  provided.  As we have no history ofsignificant cancellations, we do not record a reserve for cancellations.                                       39                                    NYFIX, INC.        Capital  sale  revenue,  which  primarily  is  comprised of software andcapital equipment sales and professional  services fees, is generated  primarilyby sales to customers in the futures,  options and currencies  trading market orto those customers who typically acquire software licenses in perpetuity, and isrecognized upon shipment of the product and acceptance by the customer.  Capitalsale revenue  pertaining to software sales is recognized in accordance  with SOP97-2,  described  above.  As we have no history of significant  sales returns orallowances, we do not record a reserve for sales returns and allowances.        Service contract  revenue,  which is comprised of maintenance  contractsfor  subscription  equipment and software and capital  equipment,  is recognizedover the  contract  period  on a  straight-line  basis.  Service  contracts  forsubscription equipment are generally co-terminus with the subscription contract.Service contracts for software and capital equipment, typically characterized asa percentage of the original  capital sale amount,  are generally for an initialterm of one to three  years with  automatic  renewal  periods  unless we receiveprior written notice of  cancellation.  Certain  service  contracts  provide forinvoicing in advance of the service being performed, generally quarterly.        Transaction revenue primarily consists of per-share  commissions chargedto  customers  who send and  receive  a match  and  execution  in our ATS  ordermatching  system,  and  customers to whom we provide  execution  and smart orderrouting  technology and gateways to access markets in: (1) their own name, (2) athird  party  give up name,  or (3) our  name.  Revenue  on these  contracts  isgenerally  invoiced monthly in arrears or is extracted from the clearing processwithin three days of the trade date and  recognized in the period in which it isearned.   Certain   transaction   revenue  contracts,   which  include  multipledeliverables, or other types of our revenue are accounted for in accordance withEITF No. 00-21,  described  above.  Some of these  contracts have minimum volumecommitments or are invoiced at a minimum  transaction-based fee. The arrangementconsideration  is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values ofeach  element.  We account  for each  element of an  arrangement  with  multipledeliverables  separately.  Vendor specific  objective evidence for fair value ofservices is primarily determined by reference to renewal pricing.        Revenue on contracts  that is invoiced in advance of the services  beingperformed is deferred and  recognized  as revenue in the period earned and untilearned is included in "deferred  revenue" in our  consolidated  balance  sheets.Shipping, handling and installation charges, if any, are generally invoiced to acustomer and are included in revenue upon completion of the installation.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS        We are required to estimate the  collectibility of our trade receivablesand a  considerable  amount of judgment is required in  assessing  the  ultimaterealization  of  receivables,  including the current  credit-worthiness  of eachcustomer.  We maintain  allowances  for doubtful  accounts for estimated  lossesresulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.  If thefinancial  condition  of our  customers  were to  deteriorate,  resulting  in animpairment  of their  ability to make  payments,  additional  allowances  may berequired.  The  collectibility  of accounts  receivable is evaluated  based on acombination  of  factors.  In  circumstances  where we are  aware of a  specificcustomer's  inability  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  (e.g.,  bankruptcyfilings),  a specific  reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due, toreduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will becollected.  For all other  customers,  we estimate a reserve for bad debts basedupon applying certain  percentages,  based on historical loss trends, to certainaccounts  receivable  aging  categories,  net of accounts  receivable  for whichrevenue  recognition has been deferred.  If circumstances  change (i.e.,  higherthan  expected  defaults or an  unexpected  material  adverse  change in a majorcustomer's  ability to meet its financial  obligations  to us), our estimates ofthe recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount.                                       40                                    NYFIX, INC.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT        Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated  depreciation.Included in equipment are certain costs related to the  development of our NYFIXNetwork to support our subscription and service based  businesses.  Depreciationof property and equipment is provided  using the  straight-line  method over itsestimated useful lives. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances,changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result inthe actual useful lives differing from initial  estimates.  In those cases wherewe determine that the useful life of long-lived asset should be revised, we willdepreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over itsrevised remaining useful life.ACQUISITIONS AND GOODWILL        Net assets of  companies  we acquired  have been  recorded at their fairvalue at the  date of  acquisition.  Goodwill  represents  acquisition  costs inexcess of the fair value of net assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  Weadopted  FASB  Statement  of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 142,GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE  ASSETS effective  January 1, 2002. The provisionsof SFAS No. 142 require that we allocate  our goodwill to our various  reportingunits,  determine the carrying value of those businesses,  and estimate the fairvalue of the reporting units so that a two-step goodwill  impairment test can beperformed.  Our reporting units represent  components of our operating  segmentsand  are  the  same  as the  reportable  segments  identified  in Note 16 to theConsolidated Financial Statements.  In the first step of the goodwill impairmenttest, the fair value of each  reporting unit is compared to its carrying  value.If the fair value  exceeds the carrying  value,  goodwill is not impaired and nofurther testing is performed. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, thenthe second step must be  performed,  and the implied fair value of the reportingunit's  goodwill  must be determined  and compared to the carrying  value of thegoodwill for the  reporting  unit. If the carrying  value of a reporting  unit'sgoodwill  exceeds its implied fair value,  then an impairment  loss equal to thedifference is recorded.  In the absence of  circumstances  requiring  impairmenttesting on a  quarterly  or other more  frequent  basis,  our annual  impairmenttesting date is the beginning of our fourth quarter, which is October 1. For theyears  ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  there was no  indication  ofimpairment  for  either  of  our  reporting  units  -  Transaction  Services  orTechnology  Services as the present value of the discounted future cash flows ofeach reporting  unit exceeded  their carrying  values as of October 1, 2004, thedate of our annual impairment analysis.PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT COSTS        Costs incurred in the research,  design and  development of software forsale to others as a separate  product or  embedded in a product and sold as partof the product as a whole are charged to expense until technological feasibilityis established.  Thereafter, software development costs, consisting primarily ofpayroll and related costs,  purchased  materials and services and software to beused within our  products,  which  significantly  enhance the  marketability  orsignificantly extend the life of our products are capitalized,  and amortized tocost of revenue on a  straight-line  basis over three years,  beginning when theproducts are offered for sale or when the  enhancements  are integrated into theproduct.  We are required to use  professional  judgment in determining  whetherproduct   enhancement   costs  meet  the  criteria  for  immediate   expense  orcapitalization,  in  accordance  with SFAS No. 86,  ACCOUNTING  FOR THE COSTS OFCOMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED.                                       41                                    NYFIX, INC.LONG-LIVED ASSETS        We review the carrying value of long-lived  assets,  including  propertyand  equipment;  intangible  assets;  investments,  notes  receivable  and otheramounts due from unconsolidated  affiliates; and capitalized product enhancementcosts for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carryingamount may not be fully  recoverable.  If such an event or circumstances  occur,the related estimated fair value of the assets would be compared to the carryingamount,  and if needed, we would record an impairment to the extent by which thecarrying amount exceeded the fair value of the assets. We test intangible assetswith  indefinite  lives annually for impairment  using a fair value  methodologysuch as discounted cash flows.  There was no impairment of our long-lived assetsrecorded for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.INCOME TAXES        We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,  ACCOUNTINGFOR INCOME TAXES ("SFAS No. 109"),  which  requires  recognition of deferred taxassets and liabilities  for the expected future tax  consequences of events thathave been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns usingpresently  enacted income tax rates.  To the extent we believe there will not besufficient taxable income to utilize these assets prior to their expiration,  wewould record a valuation allowance against the unrealizable amount, and record acharge against operating  results.  We established a valuation  allowance on ourdeferred  tax assets,  in  accordance  with SFAS No.  109,  of $25.6  million atDecember 31, 2004. Where there are cumulative  losses in recent years,  SFAS No.109 requires,  except in very limited circumstances,  that a valuation allowancebe  established.  We did not have taxable income in the years ended December 31,2004,  2003 or 2002.  We  previously  estimated  that our  deferred  tax assets,consisting  primarily  of  tax  credit  carryforwards  and  net  operating  losscarryforwards,  would be realized and no valuation allowance was required, basedon revenue and operating expense assumptions.  During the third quarter of 2004,our general and  administrative  expenses related to our initial compliance withSection 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley  and legal expenses increased more than forecastedand we expect these costs, legal fees in particular, to remain at high levels inthe near term. These cost increases, together with revenues from our TransactionServices  segment  being  impacted  by much lower than  expected  volumes in theequity  markets,  particularly  during the month of September,  were the primaryreasons we reduced  our  forecast  for the  near-term.  Until we can achieve andsustain an appropriate level of  profitability,  we plan to maintain a valuationallowance on our deferred tax assets.CONTINGENCIES        Contingencies  are recorded as  liabilities  when it is probable  that aliability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably  estimable.Disclosure  is required when there is at least a reasonable  possibility  that aloss has been  incurred  or that the  ultimate  loss  may  exceed  the  recordedprovision.  We use  outside  counsel to assist us in various  matters  includingregulations,  acquisitions,  trademark,  patent, personnel and other matters. Werely  on the  professional  judgment  of  outside  counsel  as  well  as our ownassessment in determining whether contingencies should be recorded.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION        We  account  for  stock-based   compensation  for  employees  under  therecognition  and  measurement  provisions  of the  Accounting  Principles  Board("APB") Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES ("APB No. 25"),and related  interpretations  and have elected the  disclosure-only  alternativeunder  SFAS  No.  123,  ACCOUNTING  FOR  STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION.

Cost of revenue  principally  consists of costs associated with our datacenters  where  we  maintain   equipment  and   infrastructure  to  support  ouroperations,  amortization of capitalized  product enhancement costs and acquiredintangible  assets,  depreciation  of  subscription  equipment  and other directcosts, including customer-specific  telecommunication costs, execution, clearingfees and market data feeds. Certain data center costs, such as labor,  equipmentmaintenance,  software support and depreciation and amortization,  are allocatedacross our lines of business based on usage estimates.        Operating  expense is comprised of selling,  general and  administrative("SG&A"),  research and development  ("R&D"),  equity in loss of  unconsolidatedaffiliates and depreciation and amortization.  SG&A expense consists of salariesand  benefits,  office rent and other  office  expense,  provision  for doubtfulaccounts, and marketing expense. SG&A expense is allocated to our segments basedon usage estimates.  Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates consists of 40%of EuroLink's  operating losses from March 6, 2002 through March 28, 2004 (which                                       44                                   NYFIX, INC.is when we acquired the  remaining 60% of EuroLink that we did not already own),18% of Renaissance's operating losses from October 2, 2002 through June 30, 2003(which is when we acquired the remaining 82% of  Renaissance's  membership unitsthat we did not already  own) and 100% of NYFIX  Millennium's  operating  lossesprior to our  exercising  the  Option  on  February  1,  2002,  which is when weacquired an additional 30% ownership interest in NYFIX Millennium,  resulting inour 80% ownership interest in NYFIX Millennium, regained control of its Board ofDirectors and consolidated its financial statements.  R&D expense relates to ourcost of developing new products and  technologies to meet the current and futureneeds of our customers,  up to the point of technical feasibility at which pointwe capitalize such costs to bring our products to market.  R&D expense  consistsprimarily of salaries and related costs for our technical and development staff.Depreciation and amortization expense consists of such expense for our corporateequipment and software and amortization of certain intangible assets.YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003REVENUE        The following table presents an overview of our revenue:                                         YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                              ---------------------------------------------                                     2004                    2003                                  $         %            $         %                              -------------------     ---------------------                                          ($ IN THOUSANDS)Technology Services:   Subscription               $ 40,982      68%       $ 35,831      66%   Capital sale                  8,929      15%          8,955      17%   Service contract             10,528      17%          9,370      17%                             ---------                --------     Sub-total                  60,439      80%         54,156      82%                             ---------                --------Transaction Services:   Subscription                  2,637      15%          1,611      11%   Transaction                  14,787      85%         12,732      89%                             ---------                --------     Sub-total                  17,424      23%         14,343      22%                             ---------                --------Eliminations:   Subscription                 (2,728)     n/a         (2,590)     n/a                             --------                 --------     Sub-total                  (2,728)     n/a         (2,590)     n/a                             ---------                --------Total revenue   Subscription                 40,891      53%         34,852      53%   Capital sale                  8,929      12%          8,955      14%   Service contract             10,528      14%          9,370      14%   Transaction                  14,787      20%         12,732      19%                             ---------                --------     Consolidated revenue     $ 75,135     100%       $ 65,909     100%                             =========                ========Segment subtotals are presented as a percentage of consolidated revenue.        Consolidated  revenue  increased $9.2 million,  or 14%, to $75.1 millionfor 2004 as compared to $65.9 million for 2003.        Our Technology  Services segment revenue increased $6.2 million, or 11%,to $60.4 million for 2004 as compared to $54.2 million for 2003.                                       45                                   NYFIX, INC.        Subscription  revenue for our Technology  Services segment  increased to$41.0 million for 2004 from $35.8 million for 2003.  This $5.2 million  increasewas primarily attributable to a $4.5 million increase in subscription revenue asa result of our buy-side  initiative,  as described below, and a net increase of$0.7  million  in  subscription   revenue  from  our   traditional   technology,derivatives, Renaissance and Javelin products primarily due to a net increase incustomers.  In August 2002,  we began a direct  marketing  initiative to connectbuy-side  institutions  to our expansive  NYFIX Network.  We expect our buy-siderelated  subscription  revenue to continue to increase in 2005 as we continue toadd buy-side  customers.  In addition,  with the  integration of the RenaissanceNasdaq  trading  platform  product  into our product  offering,  we expect a netincrease in customers and subscription revenue in 2005.        Capital  sale  revenue  for our  Technology  Services  segment  was $8.9million  for 2004 as  compared to $9.0  million  for 2003.  Reduced  Javelin andderivatives products capital sales were largely offset by increased professionalservice fee revenue  related to our derivatives  products.  Capital sale revenuecontinues to vary  considerably  from  quarter to quarter.  While we expect thatcapital sale revenue will be comparable  in 2005 to 2004, we cannot  predict thetiming and consistency of such revenue.        Service revenue for our Technology  Services segment  increased to $10.5million for 2004 from $9.4 million for 2003, which was primarily attributable toan  increase  in service  revenue  related  to the  aforementioned  increase  insubscription  revenue  related to our  buy-side  initiative,  and an increase inmaintenance revenue, which was based on prior capital sale revenue.        As a  percentage  of total  revenue,  our  Technology  Services  segmentdecreased to 80% for 2004 from 82% for 2003,  primarily as Transaction  Servicessegment revenue, described below, grew at a faster pace in 2004.        Our Transaction Services segment revenue increased $3.1 million, or 21%,to $17.4 million for 2004 as compared to $14.3 million for 2003. Our TransactionServices  customer base  increased in 2004 to 195 from 100 at December 31, 2003,averaging  153  and  77  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2004  and  2003,respectively.  Average  revenue per customer  decreased to $114,000 in 2004 from$186,000 in 2003. The decrease in average revenue per customer was attributed toa decrease in revenue from several  large  customers  and an increase in smallercustomers.  The average revenue attributed to customers'  orderflow was lower in2004 than in 2003 as a result  of lower  volume of  orderflow  executed  for theaverage customer, coupled with continuous downward pressure on per-share pricingfor such  customers.  The  acquisition  of  EuroLink  and the  startup  of NYFIXInternational in March 2004 did not have a significant effect on revenue for theyear ended December 31, 2004. For our Transaction Services segment, we expect tocontinue to add customers throughout 2005 with the emphasis placed on adding thebuy-side  customers to NYFIX Transaction  Services.  We expect this component ofour  business  to continue to grow as a  percentage  of the overall  TransactionServices  segment.  As a percentage of total revenue,  our Transaction  Servicessegment  increased to 23% for 2004 from 22% for 2003. We expect our  TransactionServices segment revenue to be a larger  percentage of our consolidated  revenuein future periods.COST OF REVENUE        The following table presents an overview of our cost of revenue:                                       46                                   NYFIX, INC.

Consolidated  cost of revenue  increased $6.6 million,  or 19%, to $41.3million for 2004 as compared to $34.7 million for 2003. The primary  factors forthe  increase in 2004 were labor  costs of $2.2  million,  primarily  to supportRenaissance,   Javelin  and  traditional  products,   product  enhancement  costdepreciation  and  intangible  asset  amortization  of $1.7  million,  which wasprimarily  due to increased  investment  in our  Technology  Services  products,transaction  execution  expenses,  including  clearing  fees,  of $1.2  million,related to the increase in our transaction  revenue,  telecommunication  expenseand cross  connection  fees of $1.1  million,  primarily to support our buy-sideinitiative,  and other $0.2 million. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenueincreased  to  55%  for  2004,  from  53%  for  2003,  as  the  increase  in theaforementioned  Technology  Services  costs and  Transaction  Services  costs asdiscussed   below  exceeded  the  increases  in  our  Technology   Services  andTransaction Services revenue.        Our Technology  Services segment cost of revenue increased $4.9 million,or 19%, to $31.2  million  for 2004  compared  to $26.3  million for 2003.  Thisincrease was primarily attributable to higher allocated corporate expenses, suchas  data  center  and  service  support  labor,   telecommunications   expenses,depreciation  and  amortization  of fixed  assets  and  amortization  of productenhancement  costs,  of $3.6 million.  These costs were  supplemented  by higherdirect  network  connection  expenses of $0.5 million and other expenses of $0.4million.  As a percentage of segment revenue,  our cost of revenue  increased to52% in 2004,  from 49% in 2003,  as the  increase in such costs grew at a fasterrate than our revenue in this segment. We expect to see a slight decrease in ourcost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in 2005 as many of the investments inproperty  and  equipment in our data center and network  infrastructure  made inrecent years should yield lower costs as a percentage of revenue.                                       47                                   NYFIX, INC.        Our Transaction Services segment cost of revenue increased $1.9 million,or 17%,  to $12.8  million  for 2004  compared  to $10.9  million  for 2003.  Inaddition to the previously described increase in transaction  execution expensesof $1.1  million,  cost of revenue  increased by $0.7 million  comprised of $0.4million in allocated corporate expenses and $0.3 million of other expenses.  Theacquisition of EuroLink and the startup of NYFIX International in March 2004 didnot have a significant effect on cost of revenue for the year ended December 31,2004. As a percentage of segment revenue,  cost of revenue  decreased to 74% for2004, from 76% for 2003, as the increase in our costs grew at a slower rate thanour revenue. We expect our cost of revenue to further decline as a percentage ofTransaction  Services  segment  revenue  in 2005.  This is  attributable  to theexpected increases in revenue and the change in customer mix as described above,which should  enable us to spread our fixed costs over a greater  revenue  base,and  reduced  execution  expenses  partially  as a result of  self-clearing  ourtrades.GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN (AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE)        The following  table  presents an overview of our gross profit and grossprofit margin:                                              YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                   --------------------------------------------                                           2004                  2003                                        $        %           $          %                                   --------------------   --------------------                                              ($ IN THOUSANDS)Technology Services:   Subscription                    $ 17,227      42%      $ 15,481      43%   Capital sale                       5,328      60%         5,887      66%   Service contract                   6,673      63%         6,473      69%                                   --------               --------     Sub-total                       29,228      48%        27,841      51%                                   --------               --------Transaction Services:   Subscription                         170       6%            70       4%   Transaction                        4,407      30%         3,331      26%                                   --------               --------     Sub-total                        4,577      26%         3,401      24%                                   --------               --------Eliminations:   Subscription                        (198)     n/a        (1,118)     n/a   Transaction                          198      n/a         1,118      n/a                                   --------               --------     Sub-total                         --        n/a          --        n/a                                   --------               --------Total gross profit:   Subscription                      17,199      42%        14,433      41%   Capital sale                       5,328      60%         5,887      66%   Service contract                   6,673      63%         6,473      69%   Transaction                        4,605      31%         4,449      35%                                   --------               --------     Consolidated gross profit     $ 33,805      45%      $ 31,242      47%                                   ========               ========Percentages  are  presented  as a  percentage  of  segment  revenue,  except forconsolidated  gross profit  percentages,  which are presented as a percentage ofconsolidated revenue.        Consolidated  gross profit  increased  $2.6 million to $33.8 million for2004 from $31.2 million for 2003.  Our gross profit margin  decreased to 45% for2004,  as compared to 47% for 2003 as our cost of revenues grew at a higher ratethan our revenue.                                       48                                   NYFIX, INC.        Our Technology  Services  segment gross profit increased $1.4 million to$29.2  million for 2004 from $27.8  million for 2003. As a percentage of segmentrevenue,  gross profit margin  decreased to 48% for 2004 from 51% for 2003.  Thedecrease in gross profit  margin is  primarily  attributable  to the  previouslydescribed  increases in our costs,  which grew faster than  revenue,  as we weregenerally  unable to pass  increased  costs to our customers due to  competitivepricing  pressures.  We  expect to see  slight  improvements  in our  TechnologyServices segment gross profit margin in 2005, as many of the improvements to ourdata center and network  infrastructure  made in recent years should yield lowercosts as a percentage of revenue.        Our Transaction  Services segment gross profit increased $1.2 million to$4.6 million for 2004 from $3.4  million for 2003.  The increase in gross profitwas primarily  attributable to the previously  described increase in transactionrevenue.  Transaction  Services segment gross profit margin increased to 26% for2004, as compared to 24% for 2003 as execution  costs  decreased as a percentageof revenue,  primarily as a result of reduced rate of broker and clearing  fees.The acquisition of EuroLink and the startup of NYFIX International in March 2004did not have a  significant  effect on gross profit for the year ended  December31,  2004.  We expect  our  Transaction  Services  segment  gross  margin,  as apercentage of revenue,  to continue to improve in 2005.  This is attributable toour  expected  increases in customers  and  revenue,  which should  enable us tospread our fixed costs over a greater  revenue base, and continued  reduction inexecution  and  clearing  expenses as a result of  utilizing  fewer  introducingbrokers and self-clearing our trades through NYFIX Clearing.SG&A        The following table presents an overview of our SG&A expense:                                                 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                        ----------------------------------------                                              2004                 2003                                            $       %           $         %                                        ----------------     ----------------                                                   ($ in thousands)Salaries and benefits                   $22,973     56%      $21,239     58%Provision for doubtful accounts             763      2%        2,831      8%Occupancy and related                     4,094     10%        3,817     10%Marketing, travel and entertainment       2,976      7%        2,382      7%Professional fees                         5,664     14%        2,527      7%General and other                         4,359     11%        3,598     10%                                       --------              -------    Total SG&A                      $40,829     54%      $36,394     55%                                       ========              =======The total SG&A is presented as a percentage of consolidated revenue.        SG&A expense increased $4.4 million,  or 12%, to $40.8 million for 2004,as compared to $36.4 million for 2003.  The increase was primarily  attributableto increased professional and consulting fees of $3.1 million due principally toprofessional  fees  incurred  in  connection  with the  restatement  of our 1999through 2002 financial statements in May 2004, the class-action  complaint filedagainst us, SEC matters and consulting  fees related to  Sarbanes-Oxley  initialSection  404  compliance;  increased  salaries  and  benefits  of  $1.7  millionprimarily  due to  increased  staffing  related  to our  July  2003  Renaissanceacquisition,  annual merit  increases  which were effective  January 1, 2004 andincreased health care costs,  which were partially  offset by lower  stock-basedcompensation expense; increased marketing,  travel and entertainment expenses of$0.6  million,  primarily  related to the  commencement  of operation  for NYFIXInternational  and increased  occupancy and related expenses of $0.3 million dueprimarily to overlapping rent expense while we operated from two offices on WallStreet and expenses  associated with EuroLink of $0.5 million.  These items werepartially  offset by a reduced  provision for doubtful  accounts of $2.1 million                                       49                                   NYFIX, INC.due to our  recording of a provision  of $2.2  million in the fourth  quarter of2003. As a percentage of total revenue,  SG&A expense  decreased to 54% for 2004from 55% for 2003, as the increase in  consolidated  revenue was slightly higherthan the increase in SG&A expense. We expect that our general and administrativeexpenses,  particularly related to our professional fees, including legal, auditand consulting fees in connection with the class-action  complaint filed againstus, SEC matters and  Sarbanes-Oxley  compliance  will remain at higher levels inthe near term. In addition,  we expect our employee benefit costs,  specificallyour primary health  insurance  rate, to increase  approximately  20% in 2005. Topartially offset the anticipated cost increases in 2005, we deferred most of ouremployees' annual merit increases to be effective July 1, 2005.        As discussed  below,  in February  2004, we entered into an agreement tolease additional space at our 100 Wall Street office. Although we did not occupythe  additional  space  until  August  2004,  in  accordance  with SFAS No.  13,ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES, we commenced recording rent expense on February 1, 2004.RESTRUCTURING CHARGE        Effective  February  1, 2004,  we  entered  into an  agreement  to leaseadditional space at our New York City offices at 100 Wall Street.  In connectionwith this  agreement,  in the second quarter of 2004 we ceased use of one of ourother offices on Wall Street and commenced consolidating our operations into thenew space and eliminated 14 staff  positions.  In accordance  with SFAS No. 146,ACCOUNTING FOR EXIT OR DISPOSAL  ACTIVITIES,  we recorded a charge to operationsof $2.5  million.  This charge  included  the fair value of the  remaining  rentpayments, net of anticipated sub-lease income, severance and write-offs of fixedassets and  leasehold  improvements.  We now  maintain one office on Wall Streetcomprising  35,800 square feet,  which is a 23% reduction from the 46,500 squarefeet previously leased. In addition to operational efficiencies, we believe thatwe can realize an annual lease savings of approximately  20% for our Wall Streetoffice.  We entered into  sub-lease  agreements  for the entire  premises of ourformer office. We do not currently anticipate any restructuring charge in 2005.R&D        R&D expense  decreased  $0.4 million,  or 29%, to $1.0 million for 2004,from $1.4  million for 2003 as our  software  developers  and quality  assurancepersonnel  focused  their  efforts on enhancing  and  extending the lives of ourproducts. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense decreased to 1% for 2004from 2% for 2003. We expect to invest a similar amount in R&D expense in 2005.EQUITY IN LOSS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES        In 2004, we recognized  equity in the losses of EuroLink of $0.1 millionfor the three months ended March 31, 2004. In 2003, we recognized  equity in thelosses of  EuroLink  of $0.4  million  and equity in the  losses of  Renaissancethrough  June  30,  2003 of  $0.4  million.  We  accounted  for  our  previouslyunconsolidated  affiliates,  EuroLink and  Renaissance,  under the equity methodthrough the acquisition dates of March 29, 2004 and July 1, 2003, respectively.DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION        Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.3 million, or 12%, to$2.3  million for 2004,  from $2.6  million for 2003 due to an increase in fullydepreciated  assets.  As  a  percentage  of  total  revenue,   depreciation  andamortization  expense decreased to 3% for 2004 from 4% for 2003. The decrease asa  percentage  of total  revenue was  primarily  attributable  to the  decreasedamortization  expense  compared  to the  increased  revenue.  We expect to see asimilar  decreasing trend of depreciation  and amortization  expense in the nearterm.                                       50                                   NYFIX, INC.LOSS FROM OPERATIONS        Loss from  operations  was $12.9 million for 2004, as compared to a lossfrom  operations of $10.0 million for 2003.  The  increased  operating  loss wasprimarily due to the restructuring  charge of $2.5 million;  higher SG&A expenseof $4.4 million,  primarily due to professional  fees related to the restatementof our 1999 through 2002  consolidated  financial  statements  in May 2004,  theclass-action complaint filed against us, SEC matters and consulting fees relatedto  Sarbanes-Oxley  initial  Section 404  compliance.  The cost  increases  werepartially  offset by increased gross profit as described  above. As a percentageof total revenue, loss from operations was a deficit of 17% for 2004 as comparedto a deficit  of 15% for  2003.  The  increased  loss as a  percentage  of totalrevenue  was  attributable  primarily  to the  greater  percentage  increase  inoperating  expenses,  including  the  restructuring  charge,  as compared to thepercentage increase in revenue.INTEREST EXPENSE        Interest  expense  increased $0.6 million,  or 300%, to $0.8 million for2004 from $0.2 million for 2003, primarily due to interest expense recognized onsales tax obligations and accelerated  interest  expense on the notes to certainRenaissance  unitholders  which were in default.  We expect interest  expense toincrease  in 2005,  primarily  as a result of a $7.5  million  convertible  noteissued on December 30, 2004.INVESTMENT INCOME        Investment  income  decreased $0.5 million,  or 83%, to $0.1 million for2004 from $0.6 million for 2003, primarily due to lower interest income on loansto  unconsolidated  affiliates  and lower  overall  invested  consolidated  cashbalances. We expect investment income to decrease in 2005.OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET        Other income (expense), net increased $0.2 million in 2004 primarily dueto a loss of $0.1  million  on the  extinguishment  of debt in  connection  withamended promissory notes to certain unitholders of Renaissance.INCOME TAXES        We recorded an income tax provision of $19.1 million for 2004,  comparedto a tax benefit of $4.6 million for 2003. We established  an initial  valuationallowance on our deferred tax assets,  in accordance with SFAS No. 109, of $21.0million during the quarter ended September 30, 2004.  Where there are cumulativelosses  in  recent  years,  SFAS  No.  109  requires,  except  in  very  limitedcircumstances,  that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance be established. Wedid not have  operating  income in the years ended  December 31,  2004,  2003 or2002.  We had  previously  estimated  that our deferred  tax assets,  consistingprimarily of tax credit  carryforwards  and net  operating  loss  carryforwards,would be realized and no valuation allowance was required,  based on revenue andoperating expense assumptions. During the third quarter of 2004, our general andadministrative expenses related to Sarbanes-Oxley initial Section 404 complianceand legal fees increased more than  forecasted and we expect these costs,  legalfees in  particular,  to remain  at high  levels in the near  term.  These  costincreases,  together with revenues from our Transaction  Services  segment beingimpacted by much lower than expected volumes in the equity markets, particularlyduring the month of September,  were the primary reasons we reduced our forecastfor the  near-term.  Until we can achieve and  sustain an  appropriate  level ofprofitability,  we plan to maintain a valuation  allowance  on our  deferred taxassets,  and accordingly we expect our future income tax provision or benefit tobe minimal.                                       51                                   NYFIX, INC.        Our  effective  tax rate was 140% for 2004 as  compared to an income taxbenefit rate of 48% for 2003.  For 2004,  our effective tax rate was higher thanthe Federal  statutory rate primarily due to the  establishment of the valuationallowance  on our  deferred  tax assets of 188%.  For 2003,  our  effective  taxbenefit rate was higher than the Federal  statutory  rate  primarily  due to theeffects of recognition of certain research and development tax credits of 6% andstate income taxes of 6%.YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002REVENUE        The following table presents an overview of our revenue:                                        YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                            ------------------------------------------------                                    2003                   2002                                 $          %           $            %                            ---------------------    -----------------------                                             ($ IN THOUSANDS)Technology Services:  Subscription               $ 35,831      66%       $ 31,377      65%  Capital sale                  8,955      17%          8,517      18%  Service contract              9,370      17%          8,471      17%                             --------                --------    Sub-total                  54,156      82%         48,365      86%                             --------                --------Transaction Services:  Subscription                  1,611      11%            488       6%  Transaction                  12,732      89%          7,109      94%                             --------                --------    Sub-total                  14,343      22%          7,597      14%                             --------                --------Eliminations:  Subscription                 (2,590)     n/a           (150)     n/a                             --------                --------    Sub-total                  (2,590)     n/a           (150)     n/a                             --------                --------Total revenue  Subscription                 34,852      53%         31,715      57%  Capital sale                  8,955      14%          8,517      15%  Service contract              9,370      14%          8,471      15%  Transaction                  12,732      19%          7,109      13%                             --------                --------    Consolidated revenue     $ 65,909     100%       $ 55,812     100%                             ========                ========Segment subtotals are presented as a percentage of consolidated revenue.        Consolidated  revenue increased $10.1 million,  or 18%, to $65.9 millionin 2003 as compared to $55.8 million in 2002.        Our Technology  Services segment revenue increased $5.8 million, or 12%,to $54.2 million in 2003 as compared to $48.4 million in 2002.        Subscription  revenue for our Technology Services segment increased $4.4million,  or 14%, to $35.8  million for 2003 from $31.4  million for 2002.  Thisincrease  was  primarily  attributable  to an increase of $1.1  million from ourbuy-side  initiative  and  a net  increase  in  subscription  revenue  from  ourtraditional  technology  customers of $0.8 million.  In August 2002, we began aninitiative  to sell circuits to buy-side  institutions  in order to leverage ourexpansive NYFIX Network.  Our traditional  technology average annualized revenue                                       52                                   NYFIX, INC.per customer was  $112,000 in 2003,  as compared to $114,000 in 2002.  While theaverage revenue per customer decreased, our total number of customers increased.At December 31, 2003, we had approximately 285 traditional equity customers,  upfrom approximately 263 at December 31, 2002. In addition  subscription  revenuesattributable to our Javelin products increased $1.9 million,  to $9.7 million in2003 from $7.8  million  in 2002,  primarily  due to  twelve  months of  Javelinsubscription  revenue  in 2003 as  compared  to nine  months  in 2002  since ouracquisition of Javelin in March 2002.        Capital  sale  revenue  for our  Technology  Services  segment  was $9.0million  for 2003 as  compared to $8.5  million  for 2002,  which was  primarilyattributable  to the  additional  three  months of Javelin  revenue  for 2003 ascompared to 2002.        Service revenue for our Technology  Services  segment  increased to $9.4million for 2003 from $8.5 million for 2002, which was primarily attributable toan increase in service revenue based on our  subscription  revenue  increase andthe additional three months of service revenue for Javelin in 2003.        Our Technology  Services segment revenue  increased $2.4 million relatedto intercompany revenue, which was eliminated in consolidation, for products andservices provided to our Transaction Services segment for their customers.        As a  percentage  of total  revenue,  our  Technology  Services  segmentdecreased to 82% in 2003 from 86% in 2002.        Our Transaction Services segment revenue increased $6.7 million, or 88%,to $14.3 million in 2003 as compared to $7.6 million in 2002. Our  broker-dealersubsidiaries,  NYFIX Transaction  Services and NYFIX Millennium operated for theentire year in 2003. NYFIX Transaction Services did not begin generating revenueuntil July 1, 2002 and we consolidated  NYFIX  Millennium upon acquisition of an80% ownership  interest in February 2002;  thus our  broker-dealer  subsidiariesgenerated  revenue  for six and  eleven  months,  respectively  in  2002.  NYFIXClearing  began  clearing  trades in November  2003,  and had only  intercompanyrevenue,  which had been eliminated in consolidation.  Our Transaction  Servicescustomer  base  doubled  during  2003  from 50 at  December  31,  2002 to 100 atDecember 2003,  averaging 77 for the year,  with average revenue per customer of$186,000 in 2003. This average  annualized  revenue per customer  decreased from$270,000  per  customer  in the first  quarter of 2003 to $150,000 in the fourthquarter of 2003.  The decrease in average  revenue per customer  during 2003 wasattributed  to a decrease in revenue from several large  customers  from whom wegenerate  revenue from DOT flow to the NYSE.  We compete with various  companiesthat  also  offer  certain  execution  services  that we  view as a  low-margin,"loss-leader"  services  to our  customers.  The  revenue  attributed  to  thesecustomers'  DOT flow was higher during the first half of 2003 than in the secondhalf of the year as a result of lowering rates to competitively keep and protectthe on-going business opportunity of any with such customers. As a percentage oftotal revenue,  our Transaction  Services segment  increased from 14% in 2002 to22% in 2003.COST OF REVENUE        The following table presents an overview of our cost of revenue:                                       53                                   NYFIX, INC.

Consolidated  cost of revenue  increased $6.3 million,  or 22%, to $34.7million in 2003 as compared to $28.4  million in 2002.  The primary  factors forthe increase  were data center and  telecommunication  expense of $2.5  million,depreciation  expense of $1.0 million and product  enhancement cost amortizationof $0.3 million,  which was primarily due to an increase in  infrastructure  andcapacity  in our data  centers  and  product  enhancements  costs to support ourTechnology Services segment, including our derivatives,  Renaissance and Javelinproducts as we integrated them with our traditional equity products and onto ourNYFIX Network. In addition, cost of revenue increased by $1.0 million, which wasattributable  to  execution,   clearing  and  specialist  fees  related  to  ourTransaction  Services revenue, and by $0.7 million for acquired intangible assetamortization  due to a full year's expense in 2003 for the NYFIX  Millennium andJavelin  acquisitions  as compared to eleven  months and nine months  expense in2002,  respectively,  and  six  months  expense  in  2003  for  the  Renaissanceacquisition.  As a percentage of revenue, our cost of revenue increased slightlyto 53% in 2003, from 51% in 2002, as the increase in the Technology Services andTransaction  Services costs offset the increase in our  Technology  Services andTransaction Services revenue as mentioned below.        Our Technology  Services segment cost of revenue increased $5.0 million,or 24%,  to $26.3  million in 2003 as  compared  to $21.3  million in 2002.  Theincrease was  primarily  attributed  to the  increases  in  allocated  corporateexpenses, such as data center and telecommunications expenses,  depreciation andamortization of fixed assets and amortization of product  enhancement  costs andamortization of acquired  intangible assets. In addition,  service contract costof revenue  increased $0.5 million,  or 21%, to $2.9 million for 2003, from $2.4                                       54                                   NYFIX, INC.million in 2002.  The increase  was  primarily  due to increased  labor costs tosupport  our  products.  As a  percentage  of segment  revenue,  cost of revenueincreased  to 49% in 2003,  from 44% in 2002,  as the increase in the costs grewfaster than revenue.        Our Transaction Services segment cost of revenue increased $3.6 million,or 50%,  to $10.9  million  in 2003 as  compared  to $7.3  million  in 2002.  Inaddition  to the  increase  in  transaction  related  expenses,  cost of revenueincreased  related to intercompany  charges  related to the Technology  Servicesrevenue passed through to Transaction Services customers, of $2.4 million, whichwas eliminated in our consolidated cost of revenue.  As a percentage of revenue,cost of revenue  decreased to 76% in 2003,  from 96% in 2002,  as the  increasedsegment revenue absorbed relatively fixed costs.GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN (AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE)        The following  table  presents an overview of our gross profit and grossprofit margin:                                          YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                  ------------------------------------------                                          2003                  2002                                      $          %           $          %                                  ------------------     -------------------                                              ($ IN THOUSANDS)Technology Services:  Subscription                    $ 15,481      43%      $ 15,487      49%  Capital sale                       5,887      66%         5,559      65%  Service contract                   6,473      69%         6,059      72%                                  --------               --------    Sub-total                       27,841      51%        27,105      56%                                  --------               --------Transaction Services:  Subscription                          70       4%           272      56%  Transaction                        3,331      26%            13       0%                                  --------               --------    Sub-total                        3,401      24%           285       4%                                  --------               --------Eliminations:  Subscription                      (1,118)    n/a           (150)    n/a  Transaction                        1,118     n/a            150     n/a                                  --------               --------    Sub-total                         --       n/a           --       n/a                                  --------               --------Total gross profit:  Subscription                      14,433      41%        15,609      49%  Capital sale                       5,887      66%         5,559      65%  Service contract                   6,473      69%         6,059      72%  Transaction                        4,449      35%           163       2%                                  --------               --------    Consolidated gross profit     $ 31,242      47%      $ 27,390      49%                                  ========               ========Percentages  are  presented  as a  percentage  of  segment  revenue,  except forconsolidated  gross profit  percentages,  which are presented as a percentage ofconsolidated revenue.        Consolidated  gross profit  increased  $3.8 million to $31.2  million in2003 from $27.4  million in 2002.  The  increases  in  Technology  Services  andTransaction Services cost of revenue offset the increases in Technology Servicesand Transaction Services revenue. Accordingly, our gross profit margin decreasedto 47% for 2003, as compared to 49% for 2002.        Our Technology  Services  segment gross profit increased $0.7 million to$27.8  million in 2003 from $27.1  million in 2002.  As a percentage  of segment                                       55                                   NYFIX, INC.revenue,  our gross profit margin decreased to 51% in 2003 from 56% in 2002. Thedecrease in gross profit is primarily  attributable to the previously  describedincreases  in our costs,  which grew  faster than  revenue as we were  generallyunable to pass  increased  costs to our  customers  due to  competitive  pricingpressures.        Our Transaction  Services segment gross profit increased $3.1 million to$3.4  million in 2003 from $0.3  million  in 2002.  Transaction  Services  grossprofit  margin  increased  to 24% for 2003,  as  compared  to 4% for  2002.  Theincrease  in gross  profit  was  attributable  to the  increase  in  transactionrevenue, which grew at a higher rate than costs. As mentioned previously,  NYFIXTransaction  Services incurred costs for the entire year 2002, but did not startgenerating revenue until July 1, 2002.SG&A        The following table presents an overview of our SG&A expense:                                              YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                        -------------------------------------                                              2003                2002                                           $        %          $        %                                        -----------------   ----------------                                                ($ in thousands)Salaries and benefits                   $21,239     58%      $19,881     62%Provision for doubtful accounts           2,831      8%        1,146      3%Occupancy and related                     3,817     10%        3,544     11%Marketing, travel and entertainment       2,382      7%        2,825      9%Professional fees                         2,527      7%        2,041      6%General and other                         3,598     10%        2,803      9%                                        -------             --------  Total SG&A                        $36,394     55%      $32,240     58%                                        =======             =========The total SG&A is presented as a percentage of consolidated revenue.        SG&A expense increased $4.2 million,  or 13%, to $36.4 million for 2003,as compared to $32.2 million for 2002.  The increase was primarily  attributableto an increased  provision for doubtful  accounts of $1.7 million as a result ofour  recording of a provision of $2.2 million in the fourth  quarter of 2003 dueprincipally  to our cash  collection  program.  In  addition,  our  salaries andbenefits expenses increased $1.4 million, primarily due to increased staffing tosupport our  operations,  annual merit  increases  for our staff and  continuingincreases to health care costs, however these increases were partially offset bylower  compensation  expense related to stock options of $0.7 million in 2003 ascompared to $2.5 million in 2002. Our  professional  fees increased $0.5 millionin 2003 as compared to 2002,  due  primarily  to non-audit  services  related toinitial Sarbanes-Oxley  compliance,  in addition to other legal and professionalservices.  Occupancy and related expenses increased $0.3 million,  primarily dueto the  Renaissance  acquisition.  General  and  other  expense  increased  $0.8million,  which included increased general insurance expense of $0.4 million anda variety of other items aggregating $0.4 million, net. As a percentage of totalrevenue,  SG&A expense  decreased to 55% in 2003 as compared to 58% in 2002,  asthe increase in consolidated revenue outpaced the increase in SG&A expense.R&D        R&D expense  decreased $0.1 million to $1.4 million for 2003 as comparedto $1.5  million  for 2002.  As a  percentage  of total  revenue,  research  anddevelopment  expense  decreased to 2% for 2003 from 3% for the 2002,  due to theincrease in revenue.                                       56                                   NYFIX, INC.EQUITY IN LOSS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES        Effective  February 1, 2002,  we  exercised  the Option to increase  ourownership  interest  in  NYFIX  Millennium,  from  50% to 80% and at  that  dateconsolidated NYFIX Millennium's financial statements.  NYFIX Millennium incurredoperating  losses  of $1.4  million  for the  month of  January  2002,  which werecognized under the equity method.        Our equity interest in our other previously  unconsolidated  affiliates,Renaissance  (which we acquired in July 2003) and EuroLink (which we acquired inMarch 2004),  increased $0.2 million to $0.8 million for 2003, from $0.6 millionfor 2002, due primarily to our equity in the losses  incurred by these entities.We  recognized  our equity in the losses of  EuroLink  of $0.4  million in 2003,compared  to losses of $0.5  million in 2002.  We  recognized  our equity in thelosses of Renaissance through June 30, 2003 of $0.4 million. We made our initialinvestment in  Renaissance  in the fourth  quarter of 2002,  and  recognized ourequity  in its  losses  of  $0.1  million  in  that  period.  We  accounted  forRenaissance by the equity method through June 30, 2003.  Effective July 1, 2003,we acquired the remaining 82% of the membership units in Renaissance that we didnot already own, and  accordingly,  we consolidated the results of operations ofRenaissance as of that date. Effective March 29, 2004, we acquired the remaining60% of  EuroLink  that we did  not  already  own,  and  consolidated  EuroLink'soperating results as of that date.DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION        Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.6 million, or 19%, to$2.7  million for 2003,  from $3.3  million for 2002,  due  primarily to reduceddepreciation expense due to reduced levels of leased equipment.  As a percentageof total revenue, depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 4% for 2003from 6% for 2002. The decrease as a percentage of total revenue was attributableto a combination of reduced  depreciation and amortization expense and increasedrevenue.LOSS FROM OPERATIONS        Loss from  operations  decreased $1.6 million,  or 14%, to $10.0 millionfor 2003,  from $11.6 million for 2002.  The increased loss was primarily due tohigher cost of revenue and operating  expense  offset by the increase in revenueas described above. As a percentage of total revenue, loss from operations was adeficit of 15% in 2003 and 21% in 2002.INTEREST EXPENSE AND INVESTMENT INCOME        Investment  income remained  constant at $0.6 million for 2003 and 2002.This  was  principally  due  to  lower  interest  income  due to  lower  averageinvestment  balances and lower yields,  which was offset by additional  gains onsales of short-term  investments.  Interest expense  decreased $0.1 million,  or50%, to $0.2 million for 2003,  from $0.3 million for 2002,  principally  due toreduced interest on capital lease obligations as the principal  balances on suchleases declined.  We also incurred a nominal amount of interest for notes issuedin connection with our Renaissance acquisition.INCOME TAXES        We recorded an income tax benefit of $4.6 million for 2003,  compared toan income tax benefit of $4.3  million for 2002.  The income tax benefit in 2003was  attributable  to a tax benefit on our pre-tax  loss of $9.5 million and taxbenefits relating to certain Federal and state R&D tax credits  aggregating $0.6million.  Our  effective  tax benefit  rate of 48% in 2003  exceeded the Federalstatutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and Federal tax benefits andresearch  and  development  tax  credits.  The  income  tax  benefit in 2002 wasattributable  to a tax benefit on our pre-tax  loss and  recognition  of certainresearch and  development  tax credits,  aggregating  $0.9  million,  from prior                                       57                                   NYFIX, INC.years.  We will  receive no income tax  benefit  for the equity in loss of NYFIXMillennium  of $1.4  million in 2002 as the  operating  loss is allocated to theInitial  Partners and New Partners for income tax  purposes.  Our  effective taxbenefit rate of 38% for 2002 exceeded the Federal  statutory  rate primarily dueto the impact of our research and development tax credits of 8% and state incometaxes of 4%.  This  benefit  was  offset by the  impact of the equity in loss ofNYFIX Millennium of 6%.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES        Historically,  a significant  source of our funding has been the sale ofequity  securities.  Between  1997 and 1999 we raised a total of $9.5 million innet proceeds through several private  placements where we issued an aggregate of3,431,000  shares of our common stock. In 2001, we raised $57.3 million,  net ofexpenses, from a follow-on public offering of three million shares of our commonstock. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the follow-on  public offeringto  repurchase  1.3 million  shares of our common stock at an aggregate  cost of$19.1 million.  We also have historically  received funding from the exercise ofstock options,  which  aggregated $1.6 million from 2002 through 2004. We fundedour  acquisitions  of  Javelin,  NYFIX  Millennium,   Renaissance  and  EuroLinkprimarily  through  the  issuance of our common  stock and notes  payable in ourstock or cash, at our option. Please see Item 1. Business - Acquisitions.        Another  significant  source of funding  for us is cash  generated  fromoperations, which was $7.1 million, $15.4 million and $3.7 million in 2004, 2003and 2002, respectively,  aggregating $26.2 million.  Excluding changes in assetsand  liabilities,  net of  business  acquisitions,  which  tend to be subject toshort-term fluctuations, the comparable amount of cash generated from operationswas $4.8 million, $9.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively, aggregating $21.4million.  Our primary  source of cash from  operations is from revenue  receivedfrom our customers.  Our primary uses of cash for operations include data centerexpenses,  including its operations and  telecommunication  costs, and operatingexpenses, including salaries and benefits,  marketing, travel and entertainment,office  rent  and  related  occupancy,  and  other  general  and  administrativeexpenses.        We have invested  $6.7  million,  $5.3 million and $4.6 million in 2004,2003 and 2002,  respectively,  aggregating  $16.6  million,  in our data  centerinfrastructure  and other property and equipment to keep current with technologytrends. We expect to invest at a similar level in 2005 as compared to 2004.        We have capitalized product  enhancements of $6.5 million,  $5.3 millionand $2.8  million in 2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively,  to keep our  productscompetitive.  The increase in capitalized  product enhancement costs in the lasttwo years was  primarily  attributable  to our Javelin and  Renaissance  productlines.  We have many product  enhancements  in  development,  which we expect torelease into  production  during 2005. We expect to capitalize a similar  amountfor product enhancements in 2005 as compared to 2004.        We  acquired  net cash of $1.2  million in 2004 and have  invested  $2.5million,  $12.1  million  and  $17.2  million  of cash in 2003,  2002 and  2001,respectively,  aggregating  $30.6  million,  for our  acquisitions  of  Javelin,Renaissance, NYFIX Millennium, NYFIX Transaction Services and EuroLink. Includedin our 2004 amount was net  proceeds of $1.3  million  received  primarily  as areturn  of funds  held in  escrow  pursuant  to a  settlement  agreement  with arepresentative  of the former  shareholders  of Javelin.  In connection with ourRenaissance  acquisition  we  issued  outstanding  notes  payable  over the nextseveral years, aggregating $3.0 million,  payable, at our option, in cash or ourcommon stock. On April 7, 2004,  pursuant to notice from certain payees after wedefaulted on the notes,  we issued shares of our common stock as payment in fullof $2.0  million in  principal  amount of such notes.  On July 2, 2004 we issuedshares of our common  stock in  payment of $0.2  million of such notes that camedue on July 1, 2004. We intend to pay the remaining  debt with our common stock,                                       58                                   NYFIX, INC.thus not  requiring  cash.  On March 29, 2004,  we acquired the remaining 60% ofEuroLink's  common  stock that we did not already  own. We paid for the EuroLinktransaction  with $24,000 in cash and one-year  promissory  notes payable in ourcommon stock or cash, at our option, valued in the aggregate at $0.5 million. Weintegrated EuroLink with NYFIX  International.  We have no current plans for anyother  acquisitions;  we plan to continue to focus on the synergies arising fromour previous acquisitions.        Our long-term  capital needs depend on numerous  factors,  including therate at which we obtain new customers  and expand our staff and  infrastructure,as needed, to accommodate such growth, and the rate at which we choose to investin new  technologies  to modify our NYFIX  Network and  infrastructure.  We haveongoing needs for capital,  including working capital for operations and capitalexpenditures to maintain and expand our operations.        At December 31, 2004, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cashequivalents  and  short-term  investments  in the aggregate of $26.9 million andaccounts  receivable  of $13.4  million.  At December 31, 2004,  we had accountspayable and accrued expenses aggregating $18.2 million. We do not expect to makeany  significant  income  tax  payments  due to  available  net  operating  losscarryforwards and research and development tax credits.        NYFIX Clearing,  NYFIX  Transaction  Services and NYFIX  Millennium,  asregistered  broker-dealers,  are subject to the minimum net capital requirementsof the NASD. NYFIX International,  as an FSA-registered  broker-dealer,  is alsosubject to minimum net capital requirements.  During the year ended December 31,2003,  we funded  $10.8  million to NYFIX  Clearing to enable it to maintain itsminimum  excess net capital  requirement  of $10.0 million as a condition of itsapproval by the DTCC.  During the year ended  December 31, 2004,  we provided anaggregate   additional   capital  of  $1.3   million  in  the  form  of  capitalcontributions and subordinated loans to enable our US broker-dealer subsidiariesto individually  and  collectively  exceed their net capital  requirements,  andanother $1.3 million to NYFIX International in the form of capital contributionsas a condition  of NYFIX  International's  approval by the FSA. At December  31,2004, our broker-dealer subsidiaries had aggregate net capital of $12.7 million,which   exceeded  the   aggregate   minimum  and  minimum   excess  net  capitalrequirements,  collectively  by $1.7  million.  At December 31, 2004,  we had anaggregate  of $13.9  million  of our  consolidated  cash,  cash-equivalents  andshort-term  investments  committed to maintain our  broker-dealer  subsidiaries'collective minimum and minimum excess net capital requirements of $11.0 million.In the  first  quarter  of 2005,  we  provided  our  broker-dealer  subsidiariesaggregate  additional  capital of $2.8 million in the form of additional capitalcontributions. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries may need us to fund or commit moreof our consolidated  cash,  cash-equivalents  and short-term  investments in thefuture to maintain their individual  minimum and, in the case of NYFIX Clearing,its  minimum  excess  net  capital   requirements.   If  any  or  all  of  thesebroker-dealer  subsidiaries  were to fall below their minimum or minimum  excessnet  capital  requirements,  their  operations  may  be  restricted  by  certainregulatory agencies.        As a result of the reduced availability of cash due to our broker-dealernet capital  requirements,  as  described  above,  and our  continued  operatinglosses, on December 30, 2004, we issued a $7.5 million  Convertible Note with aninterest  rate  of 5% due in  December  2009  (the  "Note")  through  a  privateplacement to the Lender.  The interest on the Note is payable in cash or, at ouroption as  described  below,  by the  issuance  of shares of our  common  stock,semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, beginning June30, 2005.        The Note is  subordinated  to all of our  existing  and  future  securedindebtedness.  The Lender has certain  rights to require  that we  register  thecommon stock  issuable,  upon conversion of the Note or for payment of interest,under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Such registration  statement is tobe effective by September  30, 2005 and if it is not, we will be required to payadditional  interest,  in cash, for each month the effectiveness is delayed. The                                       59                                   NYFIX, INC.additional interest varies by month and has an aggregate cap of $500,000 for theduration  of the  Note.  The  entire  outstanding  principal  amount of the Notetogether  with all  accrued but unpaid  interest is due in cash on December  30,2009; and except under certain conditions,  we have no right of early prepaymenton the Note.        At the option of the  Lender,  the Note is  convertible  into our commonstock at $6.94 per common share, which was a 20% premium over the average of ourcommon stock  closing  price for the five trading days  preceeding  December 30,2004. At our option,  the Note is convertible into our common stock according toa formula  based on the  market  price of our stock  during the term of the Notewhich  requires  among other  things for our common  stock to exceed 150% of theprice at which the Lender can convert the Note (or $10.41 per common share).        If we issue  shares of our common  stock to convert  the Note or to makeinterest  payments,  we are  required  to pay a 5%  premium  based on an averageclosing  price of our common stock for the previous ten days.  If we convert theNote prior to December 30, 2007, we are required to pay an additional make-wholeinterest payment in either cash or our common stock at our discretion.        As a result of the restatement of our financial  statements for the yearended  December  31,  2003,  we were in breach of  certain  representations  andwarranties  relating to those financial  statements that constituted an event ofdefault under the Note. On June 24, 2005,  the Lender waived all defaults  underthe Note and  extended  the  requirement  to have a  registration  statement  beeffective  for the shares of our  common  stock that may be issued as payment ofprincipal or interest  under the Note to March 31, 2006. In exchange,  we agreedto reduce the price at which the lender can convert  the Note into common  stockfrom $6.94 per share, as described  above,  to $5.75 per share,  which was a 16%premium over the average of our common stock  closing price for the five tradingdays preceeding June 24, 2005. Accordingly,  our option to convert the Note intoour common  stock is based on the market  price of our stock  during the term ofthe Note which requires,  among other things, our common stock to exceed 150% ofthe price (or $8.63 per common share on a revised basis) at which the Lender canconvert the Note.        In addition,  at the option of the Lender, we may issue to the Lender upto an additional $2.5 million note under terms substantially similar to those ofthe Note. The Lender requested,  and we agreed to extend the termination date ofthe option to issue the  additional  $2.5  million  note from March 30,  2005 tountil ten days after the date we file this 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K.        We believe that our cash and short-term  investments of $26.9 million atDecember  31,  2004,  together  with  anticipated  cash  to  be  generated  fromoperations,  will be sufficient  to support our capital and operating  needs andthe net capital  requirements of our  broker-dealer  operations for at least thenext twelve months.        The following  summarizes our material commitments at December 31, 2004,and the effect such  obligations  are expected to have on our liquidity and cashflows in future periods:                                       60                                   NYFIX, INC.

As described  earlier,  under the terms of the notes issued, we may electto make the note payments in shares of our common stock  instead of cash,  whichwould reduce the amounts shown above and lessen the effect on liquidity and cashflows.  Purchase  obligations  include minimum  purchase  obligations to certaintelecommunication  providers  in exchange for pricing  discounts  and a softwarelicensing arrangement with a minimum licensing fee.WORKING CAPITAL        At  December  31,  2004,  we had  working  capital  of $20.8  million ascompared to $22.7 million at December 31, 2003.  Working capital at December 31,2004 also  included the net proceeds  from the issuance of the $7.5 million Noteon December 30, 2004. The decrease in working capital was principally due to thecash used to acquire property, equipment and leasehold improvements, enhance ourproducts,  fund pre-acquisition working capital advances to EuroLink and currentliabilities in conjunction  with the  restructuring  charge.  These amounts werepartially offset by cash flows provided by operating  activities,  cash acquiredfrom net borrowings and net cash acquired from the Javelin escrow settlement.CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES        Net cash provided by operating  activities in 2004 was $7.1 million,  asour net loss of $32.7 million, adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciationand  amortization,  deferred income taxes,  provision for doubtful  accounts andequity in loss of  unconsolidated  affiliates,  provided $4.7  million.  Workingcapital and other assets and liabilities increased $2.4 million due to increasedaccounts payable and other liabilities of $6.1 million, deferred revenue of $0.3million and net securities borrowed of $0.2 million.  These items were partiallyoffset by an increase in accounts  receivable of $3.8 million and an increase inprepaid  expenses  and  other  assets  of $0.4  million.  In 2005,  we expect tocontinue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities.        Net cash provided by operating  activities in 2003 was $15.4 million, asour net loss of $4.9 million, adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation,amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts and equity in lossof unconsolidated  affiliates,  provided $8.0 million. Working capital and otherassets and  liabilities  increased  $7.4  million  due to a decrease in accountsreceivable  of $3.4  million  and an  increase  in  accounts  payable  and otherliabilities of $1.7 million.CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES        Net cash used in investing  activities in 2004 was $13.0  million.  Thisamount consisted  primarily of capital  expenditures,  primarily for data centerequipment  and  software,  of $6.7 million,  product  enhancement  costs of $6.5million,  net purchases of short-term  investments of $1.0 million and loans andadvances to EuroLink of $0.2  million.  These amounts were  partially  offset by                                       61                                   NYFIX, INC.cash acquired from  acquisitions  of $1.4 million,  which  included cash of $1.3million  received  primarily  as a return of funds held in escrow  pursuant to asettlement  agreement  with a  representative  of  the  former  shareholders  ofJavelin. In 2005, we expect to invest a similarly  proportionate  amount of cashfor  capital  expenditures  for  property  and  equipment  as  well  as  productenhancement costs.        Net cash used in investing  activities  in 2003 was $5.8  million.  Thisconsisted  primarily  of  capital   expenditures  for  property  and  equipment,principally  for data center  equipment and software,  of $5.3 million,  productenhancement  costs of $5.3  million  and loans and  advances  to  unconsolidatedaffiliates of $2.4 million. These amounts were partially offset by proceeds fromthe net sales of short-term investments of $7.3 million.CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES        Net cash  provided  by  financing  activities  in 2004 was $7.4  millionconsisting  of net  proceeds  from  borrowings  of $7.6  million  (of which $7.2million in net proceeds  was received  from the issuance of the Note on December30,  2004) and  proceeds  of $0.4  million  from the  issuance  of common  stockresulting from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by payments undercapital lease  obligations of $0.6 million.  In 2005, we expect to repay debt of$0.4 million and capital lease obligations of $0.6 million.  We may elect to payour  promissory  note  obligations  with  shares of our common  stock,  thus notrequiring cash.        Net cash  provided by  financing  activities  in 2003 was $0.2  million,consisting primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock resultingfrom the exercise of stock  options by employees of $0.8 million and  repaymentsof notes receivable issued for common stock of $0.5 million, partially offset bypayments under capital lease obligations of $1.1 million. We had nominal capitallease obligations remaining as of December 31, 2003.SEASONALITY AND INFLATION        We believe that our operations have not been  significantly  affected byseasonality or inflation.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS        We have no  material  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  other  than,  asdescribed  above,  operating  leases that are  discussed  in Note 8 and purchaseobligations  that  are  discussed  in  Note  9  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        As  previously   mentioned  in  "Application   of  Critical   AccountingPolicies",  in  December  2004,  the FASB issued  SFAS No.  123(R),  SHARE-BASEDPAYMENT. SFAS No. 123(R) is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB No. 25and its related implementation  guidance.  SFAS 123(R) establishes standards forthe  accounting  for  transactions  in which an entity  exchanges its equity forgoods or services.  It also  addresses  transactions  in which an entity  incursliabilities  in exchange for goods or services  that are based on the fair valueof the  entity's  equity  instruments  or that may be settled by the issuance ofthose  equity  instruments.  SFAS 123(R)  focuses  primarily on  accounting  fortransactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based paymenttransactions.  SFAS 123(R)  allows  entities  to apply a modified  retrospectiveapplication  to periods  before the  required  effective  date.  SFAS  123(R) iseffective for public  entities,  such as us, that do not file as small  businessissuers as of the  beginning  of the first annual  reporting  period that beginsafter June 15,  2005,  or in our case  January 1, 2006.  We are  evaluating  theimpact  of  SFAS  No.  123(R),  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  ourconsolidated financial statements.                                       62                                   NYFIX, INC.        In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, EXCHANGES OF NONMONETARYASSETS ("SFAS No. 153").  SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges ofnonmonetary  assets.  SFAS 153  eliminates  the  exception  from the fair  valuemeasurement  for  nonmonetary  exchanges of similar  product assets in paragraph21(b) of APB  Opinion  No. 29,  ACCOUNTING  FOR  NONMONETARY  TRANSACTIONS,  andreplaces  it  with an  exception  for  exchanges  that  do not  have  commercialsubstance.  SFAS  153  specifies  that a  nonmonetary  exchange  has  commercialsubstance  if the  future  cash  flows of the  entity  are  expected  to  changesignificantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetaryasset  exchanges  occurring in fiscal periods  beginning after June 15, 2005. Wehave not  completed  our  analysis of the impact of SFAS 153, but as we have notbeen involved in significant nonmonetary exchanges in the past, we do not expectthat  the  provisions  of SFAS  No.  153  will  have a  material  impact  on ourconsolidated financial statements.        In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  INVENTORY  COSTS ("SFASNo. 151").  SFAS No. 151 amends  Accounting  Research  Bulleting ("ARB") No. 43,INVENTORY  PRICING,  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility  expense,freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized ascurrent-period  charges.  SFAS  151  also  requires  that  allocation  of  fixedproduction  overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal  capacityof the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurredduring  fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2005.  We have not completed ouranalysis of the impact of SFAS 151, but as inventory is not a material componentof our consolidated  financial statements,  we do not expect that the provisionsof SFAS No.  151 will  have a  material  impact  on our  consolidated  financialstatements.RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESSWE ARE A DEFENDANT IN A  CLASS-ACTION  COMPLAINT  RELATED TO OUR  INVESTMENT  INNYFIX MILLENNIUM.         On May 13, 2004, an action entitled FULLER & THALER ASSET MANAGEMENT V.NYFIX,  INC.,  ET AL.  was filed in the  United  States  District  Court for theDistrict of  Connecticut.  The  complaint  named us, our  Chairman  and CEO, ourformer CFO,  our current CFO and certain of our  directors  as  defendants.  Thecomplaint was filed as a purported class action claim on behalf of all buyers ofour stock  between  March 30, 2000 and March 30,  2004 and seeks an  unspecifiedamount of damages.  The complaint alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a)of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  based on the issuance of a series ofallegedly  false  and  misleading   financial   statements  and  press  releasesconcerning,  among other things, our investment in NYFIX Millennium. On July 20,2004, the court appointed three different  plaintiffs to be the lead plaintiffs,as Fuller & Thaler Asset Management withdrew as the named plaintiff.  The actionbecame styled  JOHNSON,  ET AL. V. NYFIX,  INC., ET AL. On August 19, 2004,  thenewly named  plaintiffs  filed a first  amended  class action  complaint,  whichadded,  among other things,  allegations  of violations of Sections 11 and 15 ofthe  Securities  Act  of  1933,  as  amended.  The  new  allegations  are  basedfundamentally on the same allegations as the plaintiffs asserted in the originalcomplaint.  The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the amended  complaintwith  prejudice.  Although it is not  possible  to forecast  the outcome of thismatter,  we intend to  vigorously  defend  against the complaint but can give noassurance that the outcome will not have a material impact on us.WE ARE THE SUBJECT OF TWO INQUIRIES BY THE SEC.        In connection with our restatement of our 1999 through 2002 consolidatedfinancial  statements  in May  2004,  the  Division  of  Enforcement  of the SECinformed us by letter dated July 14, 2004,  that it was  conducting  an informalinquiry.  On January  25,  2005,  we filed a current  report on Form 8-K,  whichindicated that we believed that the matter was a formal inquiry. By letter datedOctober 28, 2004, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC informed us that it wasconducting  a second  informal  inquiry,  which  related  to our  stock  optionsgranted.  On February 25,  2005,  we filed a current  report on Form 8-K,  whichindicated  that we  believed  that  the  matter  was a  formal  inquiry.  We arecooperating with the SEC with respect to both matters.  We are unable to predict                                       63                                   NYFIX, INC.the outcome of either  matter at this time and can give no  assurances  that theoutcome of either or both matters will not have a material impact on us.SOME OF OUR  SUBSIDIARIES  HAVE NOT BEEN  PROFITABLE AND THEREFORE WE MAY NOT BEPROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE.        In December 2001, we acquired an inactive  broker-dealer  and renamed itNYFIX  Transaction  Services,   Inc.  In  May  2002,  the  NASD  approved  NYFIXTransaction  Services'  membership  application and it first started  generatingrevenues as of July 1, 2002. Through its first three years of operations,  NYFIXTransaction  Services  incurred a net loss of $6.5 million and required  capitalcontributions of $8.1 million.  Although we expect NYFIX Transaction Services tostart to generate  positive cash flows during 2005, we can provide no assurancesthat it will do so.  Accordingly,  NYFIX  Transaction  Services  may  need us tocontinue to provide  funding to maintain  its minimum net capital  requirements,thus impacting our availability of cash.        Effective as of February 1, 2002, we increased our ownership interest inNYFIX  Millennium from 50% to 80%. NYFIX Millennium was formed in September 1999and since that time has incurred aggregate net operating losses of $41.8 millionthrough  December 31,  2004.  Although we expect  NYFIX  Millennium  to generatepositive  cash flows  during  2005,  we can provide no  assurances  that it willcontinue to do so. Accordingly,  NYFIX Millennium may need us to provide fundingto maintain its net capital  requirements,  thus impacting our  availability  ofcash.        Effective as of March 31, 2002, we acquired  Javelin.  Javelin  incurrednet losses of $1.8 million, $6.7 million and $2.0 million for the years 2000 and2001 and the three months ended March 31, 2002,  respectively.  Although Javelinresults are not reported separately, Javelin continued to incur net losses untilthe fourth  quarter of 2002.  We believe  that our  synergies  with Javelin willenhance our overall operating results,  but there is no assurance that they willdo so. Our strategy to apply our subscription-based model to Javelin's products,where  feasible,   may  not  be  successful.   Javelin's   business  is  heavilyconcentrated   towards  capital  sales,   which  are  very   unpredictable   andinconsistent.  Transitioning Javelin to more of a subscription-based model couldhave an adverse impact on our working capital.        Effective  as of  July  1,  2003,  we  acquired  the  remaining  82%  ofRenaissance  that we did not  previously  own.  Since its inception in September2002,  Renaissance incurred net losses of $1.6 million for the four months endedDecember 31, 2002 and $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Afterthe  acquisition  was  completed,   we  integrated  the  Renaissance  operation,including  sales  and  support  of its  product,  into our  Technology  ServicesSegment.  We believe that our synergies with Renaissance and the ability to sellour products into the OTC market will enhance our overall operating results, butthere is no assurance that it will do so.        In 2003,  we  formed  NYFIX  Clearing,  which  commenced  operations  inNovember 2003 following  approval by the DTCC to operate as a clearing firm. Forthe year ended  December 31, 2004,  NYFIX  Clearing  reported net income of $0.8million and required no incremental capital  contributions during 2004. To date,the only capital  contribution  required was $10.8 million during 2003. Althoughwe expect  cost  savings  from using  NYFIX  Clearing  to clear our  transactionbusiness  trades,  NYFIX Clearing may need us to continue to provide  funding tomaintain its minimum and excess minimum net capital requirements, thus impactingour availability of cash.        In 2004, we formed NYFIX International,  Ltd, which commenced operationsin September 2004 following  approval by the FSA.  Through  December 2004, NYFIXInternational  incurred  a net loss of $0.6  million  and  required  an  initialcapital contribution of $1.3 million.  Although we expect NYFIX International tostart to generate  positive cash flows during 2005, we can provide no assurancesthat it will  continue  to do so. In the first  quarter of 2005,  we provided toNYFIX  International an additional $0.8 million of cash in the form of a capitalcontribution.  Accordingly,  NYFIX  International  may  need us to  continue  toprovide funding to maintain its minimum net capital requirements, thus impactingour availability of cash.                                       64                                   NYFIX, INC.        If we are not profitable in 2005 or beyond, we may be required to recordan impairment  charge  relating to our  goodwill.  If the  impairment  charge issufficiently large, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could bematerial.A NUMBER OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES  HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING  HISTORY,  WHICH MAKES ITDIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THEIR PROSPECTS.  THEIR FUTURE  FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE MAYDISAPPOINT SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS AND RESULT IN A DECLINE IN OUR STOCKPRICE.        Renaissance was formed in September  2002.  NYFIX  International,  NYFIXClearing, NYFIX Millennium and Javelin were formed in March 2004, February 2003,September  1999 and  November  1997,  respectively.  Also,  we  purchased  NYFIXTransaction  Services  in  December  2001.  Because of their  limited  operatinghistory, these entities have limited financial data that can be used to evaluatetheir businesses. Consideration must be given to their prospects in light of therisks, expenses, delays, problems and difficulties frequently encountered in theestablishment  of a new business in an emerging and rapidly  evolving  industry.Renaissance,  NYFIX Clearing,  NYFIX  Millennium,  Javelin and NYFIX TransactionServices may not be successful in their businesses,  and profitability may neverbe attained or sustained.A  SIGNIFICANT  POWER  OR  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  FAILURE  COULD  CAUSE  US AND OURCUSTOMERS TO LOSE REVENUE AND SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY FOR CUSTOMER LOSSES.        Our  services  depend on our  ability to store,  retrieve,  process  andmanage  significant  databases and to  electronically  receive and process tradeorders. Our systems and data centers could fail due to power failures, caused bya  variety  of  factors,  or  outages,  caused  by  high  demand  placed  on theinfrastructures  of the  utilities we use in New York City and  elsewhere in theNortheast portion of the US. Due to the complexity of these electrical  systems,errors or failures could occur which render an entire site to be unusable.        We  constantly  monitor  system loads and  performances  and upgrade oursystems  to the  extent we  determine  to be  appropriate  to  handle  estimatedincreases  in  power  consumption.  However,  we may not be  able to  accuratelypredict future  demand.  To mitigate the impact of power  failures,  we maintaincritical  data center  facilities  at two separate  locations  in the  Northeastportion of the US. Although these data centers are serviced by the same utility,they are serviced via different sub-stations.  In the event of a power outage atany of our data  centers,  we use  uninterruptible  power  supplies  ("UPS")  toprovide limited battery backup for critical systems.  We also use diesel-poweredgenerators to backup the UPSs.        In the event of loss of power or  telecommunications  services at eitherof these locations,  we believe there are sufficient  backup facilities in placeto give us  reasonable  time to access,  or switch over to, our  redundant  datacenter.  It is  possible  that  multiple  telecommunications  vendors  could  beimpacted so severely that the  multi-vendor  and  multi-site  strategy would notinsure communications services to our customers.        Since it is  fairly  common  for  multiple  carriers  to share  the samephysical   infrastructure   such  as  Central   Offices,   telephone  poles  andbelow-ground  conduit,  instances  like  major  cable cuts or  regional  naturaldisasters could adversely impact our customers and us.WE  RELY  ON  MULTIPLE   TELECOMMUNICATIONS  CARRIERS  FOR  DATA  DELIVERY.  ANYDISRUPTIONS  TO THESE  SERVICES  COULD  HAVE A  MATERIAL  ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OURBUSINESS.        We utilize  network  services  from five  major  carriers,  directly  orindirectly through a consolidator:  AT&T, Qwest, Sprint, MCI, Verizon,  Colt andSingTel. Customers are given the choice of using one or more network carriers to                                       65                                   NYFIX, INC.provide  network  services  to their  location.  A majority  of NYFIX  customersutilize a dual carrier solution.        Our  relationship  with  each of  these  carriers  is  that of a  vendorproviding  us  services.  We  currently  do not  provide  any  services to thesecarriers.  The contracts  with these carriers have  commitment  terms that rangefrom two to five years.  We receive  discounts  based on certain term and volumecommitments.  Currently, where applicable, we are exceeding any required monthlyminimum billing amounts.        Our use of five major carriers has multiple benefits, including:        o    diversity  of  telecommunication  infrastructure  between the major             carriers;        o    a competitive  environment  to help insure  aggressive  pricing for             network services; and        o    the  ability to  completely  migrate  circuits  from one carrier to             another  due to  non-competitive  pricing  or a  carrier  no longer             providing adequate services.        If a major  carrier  were to  shut  down  its  network  without  advancewarning,  we believe it would take at least 45 days to replace  the  circuits ofthat  vendor  with those of  another  vendor.  If we moved  from one  carrier toanother,  we would  incur  substantial  expenses  because of the need to use twocarriers for some period of time.  Exclusivity  agreements  between carriers andconnecting  points on the network could also impact us. For example,  MCI is thesole provider of network services for Nasdaq. If MCI discontinued operations, wewould incur costs transitioning to a new Nasdaq network service provider.        We believe  the time  needed to  transfer  circuits  from one carrier toanother would be approximately four to six weeks. During the transfer,  we wouldincur  overlapping  circuit  charges  with each  carrier for a minimum of thirtydays. We would need to have the new circuits in place before requesting that theoriginal  circuits be  disconnected,  and we would have to provide 30 days priornotice for the circuits to be disconnected.  Therefore,  the minimum cost for usto move our business  from one carrier to another would be at least one month ofcharges from the former carrier.WE ARE SUBJECT TO HUMAN ERROR IN OUR OPERATIONS,  WHICH COULD CAUSE A DISRUPTIONIN OUR SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND CORRUPT OUR DATA.        Our  services  depend  on our  operations  staff to  manage  significantdatabases,  systems, applications and processes that receive and process orders.An outage of our systems and service  could happen as a result of human error inour operational  procedures.  We believe we have  experienced  personnel whom weregularly send for refresher training to hone their skills, we maintain databasebackups and roll back procedures in case a human error is made and we have otherpolicies,  processes and procedures in place that collectively help us to reducethe  possibility  and  consequences  of human  error.  However we can provide noassurance  that  human  error  will not cause a  significant  disruption  to oursystems or service.ANY  INFILTRATION OF HARMFUL  VIRUSES INTO OUR  INFORMATION  SYSTEMS OR NETWORKSCOULD CAUSE US TO LOSE  REVENUES AND  CUSTOMERS  AND SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY FORCUSTOMER LOSSES.        Potential sources of a virus that could affect us include connections tocustomer  systems,  emails  received  by us or  connectivity  to  the  Internet.Although to date, we have not had any incidence of a virus fully penetrating ourprotective layers and infiltrating our production systems, we continue to reviewour  protective  layers and  safeguards  as our systems are  susceptible  to thegrowing number of potential viruses.WE RELY, IN PART,  ON OTHERS TO SUPPLY THE  MATERIALS  AND SUPPLIES,  UNDERLYINGSOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS WE USE TO PROVIDE OUR SERVICES.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAINTHIRD PARTY SUPPORT AND DELIVERY ON A TIMELY AND RELIABLE BASIS,  OUR ABILITY TOPERFORM  SERVICES  COULD BE  HINDERED  AND THE  RELATIONSHIPS  WE HAVE  WITH OURCUSTOMERS COULD BE HARMED.                                       66                                   NYFIX, INC.        Our  manufactured  products are based on standard PC components  readilyavailable  in  the  consumer  market  place.  All  electronic,  computer-relatedcomponents  that  we  use in our  products  are  not  manufacturer  or  supplierspecific.  We can substitute  components  from a diverse group of  manufacturerswith no assembly or delivery delays to our customers.        However, our manufactured products contain several custom parts specificto our design.  These parts are limited to sheet metal  enclosures  and internalwiring.  We own the  designs  for  these  components  and can  source  them frommultiple  vendors in our  immediate  area or  throughout  the US.  Currently  wemaintain  relationships  with a minimum of two alternate vendors for cabling andsheet metal,  either of which can deliver  components  within standard  deliverycycles.  For both of these  components,  we use vendors  such as CTC,  AdvantageSheet Metal and Interface  Technology.  Although we maintain  relationships withnumerous vendors for our manufactured products, if we are unable to obtain thirdparty  delivery  and  support on a timely and  reliable  basis,  our  ability toprovide our product and services could be hindered.        We rely on a number of third parties to supply software and systems,  aswell as equipment and related maintenance.  Our systems are built using a numberof commonly used  technologies.  For example,  we use systems from IBM, HP, EMC,Sun Micro  Systems,  Oracle,  Sybase,  Veritas and  Microsoft.  Our products aresubject to potential  defects in these third party  components.  Although we (aswell as the individual  vendors)  exercise  strict testing and  verification  ofsystems and software, defects can cause disruptions of customer service. We haveinvested in various test systems to make sure supplier's components work as wellas our developed software.        Because we depend on third parties to supply us with underlying softwareand systems on a reliable,  timely basis,  we maintain  service and  maintenanceagreements with all of our main vendors.  We have standard service agreements atdifferent  levels,  depending  on how  critical  the  vendor's  system is to theoperation of our business. For most systems, we have a high level of redundancy,which gives us less time  critical  dependency on a particular  vendor.  We havewarranty or maintenance agreements with all above-mentioned  vendors. Because ofthe diversity in vendors, there is no dependence on a single vendor. However, ifwe are  unable to obtain  third  party  support  and  delivery  on a timely  andreliable  basis,  our  ability to perform  services  could be  hindered  and therelationships we have with our customers could be harmed.WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED  NUMBER OF NETWORK  EQUIPMENT  SUPPLIERS  AND DO NOT HAVESUPPLY  CONTRACTS.  OUR  INABILITY  TO OBTAIN  NECESSARY  NETWORK  EQUIPMENT  ORTECHNICAL SUPPORT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.        Some key  components  we use in our networks are  available  only from alimited  number of suppliers.  We do not have  long-term  supply  contracts withthese  or any  other  limited  source  vendors,  and we  purchase  data  networkequipment  on a purchase  order  basis.  If we are  unable to obtain  sufficientquantities of limited source  equipment and required  technical  support,  or todevelop  alternate  sources as  required  in the  future,  our ability to deployequipment  in our networks  could be delayed or reduced,  or we may be forced topay higher prices for our network  components.  Delays or reductions in suppliescould lead to slowdowns or failures of our networks.OUR RELIANCE ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES PROVIDERS EXPOSESUS TO A NUMBER OF RISKS  OVER  WHICH WE HAVE NO  CONTROL,  INCLUDING  RISKS WITHRESPECT TO INCREASED PRICES AND TERMINATION OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES.        The operation of our networks depends upon the capacity, reliability andsecurity of services  provided  to us by a limited  number of  telecommunicationservices  providers.  We  have  no  control  over  the  operation,   quality  ormaintenance of those services or whether the vendors will improve their servicesor continue to provide services that are essential to our business. In addition,telecommunication  services  providers  may  increase  the  prices at which theyprovide  services,  which  would  increase  our  costs.  If one or  more  of our                                       67                                   NYFIX, INC.telecommunication services providers were to cease to provide essential servicesor to  significantly  increase  their  prices,  we  could  be  required  to findalternative  vendors for these  services.  With a limited number of vendors,  wecould experience  significant  delays in obtaining new or replacement  services,which could lead to slowdowns or failures of our  networks.  This could harm ourreputation and could cause us to lose customers and revenues.A SLOWDOWN  OR FAILURE OF OUR  NETWORKS  COULD  CAUSE US TO LOSE  CUSTOMERS  ANDREVENUE.        Our business is based upon our ability to rapidly and  reliably  receiveand transmit data through our networks.  One or more of our networks  could slowdown significantly or fail for a variety of reasons, including:        o    undetected defects or errors in our software  programs,  especially             when first integrated into a network;        o    unexpected   problems   encountered   when   integrating   changes,             enhancements  or upgrades of third party equipment or software with             our systems;        o    computer viruses;        o    natural or terrorist related or other man-made disasters disrupting             power or telecommunications systems generally; and        o    damage  to,  or  failure  of,  our  systems  due to human  error or             intentional disruption.        We   may   not   have   sufficient    redundant    systems   or   backuptelecommunications  facilities  to allow us to receive and transmit  data in theevent of significant system failures. Any significant  degradation or failure ofone or more of our  networks  could  cause our  customers  to  suffer  delays intransaction processing, which could damage our reputation,  increase our servicecosts, or cause us to lose customers and revenues.OUR PRODUCTS MAY SUFFER FROM DEFECTS OR ERRORS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR REPUTATION ORSUBJECT US TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS.        The  products  we offer are  inherently  complex.  Despite  testing  andquality control,  current versions, new versions or enhancements of our productsmay contain errors. Any errors, slowdown or failure in our products may harm ourreputation  or subject us to product  liability  claims.  Significant  technicalchallenges  also arise with our  products  because our  customers  purchase  andintegrate them with a number of third party computer  applications and software.Such  integration  may not always be successful.  Any defects or errors that arediscovered after commercial release could result in the loss of revenue or delayin market acceptance of our products. Moreover, we could face higher developmentcosts  if our  products  contain  undetected  errors,  or if we fail to meet ourcustomers'  expectations.  Although  we  maintain  general  liability  insurancecoverage,  this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms orat all. In addition, a product liability claim, whether or not successful, couldharm our business by increasing our costs and distracting our management.WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL  COMPETITION IN OUR INDIVIDUAL  PRODUCT AREAS FROM COMPANIESTHAT HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL,  TECHNICAL AND MARKETING  CAPABILITIES.  THIS COULDMAKE IT MORE  DIFFICULT  FOR US TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN  MARKET SHARE AND MAY HINDEROUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY.        We operate in a highly  competitive  market  and expect  competition  tointensify in the future.  Certain of our  competitors,  including  the financialexchanges,  may have significantly  greater  financial,  technical and marketingresources and more  extensive  customer bases and knowledge of the industry thanwe have.        Our industry is constantly evolving through technological and regulatorychange. Our competition varies widely and we encounter  different  categories ofcompetitors  for  each of our  product  and  service  offerings.  We  also  face                                       68                                   NYFIX, INC.competition from customers who choose to maintain their own  infrastructure  anddevelop their own in-house proprietary order management software systems.WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND OUR CUSTOMERS' TECHNOLOGYNEEDS.        We face rapidly changing  technology and frequent new service  offeringsby competitors that can render existing services  obsolete or unmarketable.  Ourfuture  success  depends  on our  ability to enhance  existing  services  and todevelop,  introduce  and  market,  on a timely  and cost  effective  basis,  newservices   that  keep  pace  with   technological   developments   and  customerrequirements.OUR CUSTOMERS MAY DEVELOP IN-HOUSE  NETWORKS OR USE NETWORK PROVIDERS OTHER THANNYFIX AND DIVERT PART OR ALL OF THEIR DATA  COMMUNICATIONS  FROM OUR NETWORKS TOTHEIR NETWORKS.        Our  customers  may  develop  in-house  networks  or use  other  networkproviders because such customers want to connect to destinations not part of ourNYFIX Network or to only certain, but not all, destinations covered by our NYFIXNetwork.  As a result of any of these events, we could experience lower revenuesor lost  revenues  from  delays in  connecting  customers  to our NYFIX  Networkindirectly through third party providers rather than directly by us.WE FACE SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON THE PRICES FOR OUR SERVICES FROM OUR COMPETITORSAND  CUSTOMERS.  OUR  FAILURE TO SUSTAIN  PRICING  COULD  IMPAIR OUR  ABILITY TOACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY OR POSITIVE CASH FLOW.        Our  competitors  and  customers  may cause us to reduce  the  prices wecharge  for  services,  the  effects  of which we may not be able to  offset  byincreasing  the number of  customers  or  transactions.  The primary  sources ofpricing pressure include:        o    competitors offering our customers services at reduced prices;        o    our customers seeking greater pricing discounts; and        o    consolidation of existing customers.A DECLINE IN SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE, OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE, OR TRANSACTIONREVENUE WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.        Subscription   revenue  is  our  most  significant  source  of  revenue.Subscription  revenue is fixed based on a contractual period of time,  typicallyone to three years,  and is not affected by trading  volumes.  However,  tradingvolumes do affect the  revenues of our  customers  and this could  affect  theirfuture  purchases of our  technology  and  services.  Pricing  pressures  due tocompetition, failure to sign new agreements with customers because of reductionsin their new technology  spending,  and observed  consolidation in the financialsector could affect our revenues and  profitability.  Our costs  associated withsupporting the  subscription  agreements are generally  fixed and thus a loss ofrevenue would impact profitability.        Transaction  revenue  has  been a  growing  component  of  our  revenue;however,  there is no assurance we can continue to grow transaction  revenue. Asour costs to support  transaction  revenue  are  generally  fixed,  a decline inrevenue would directly impact our  profitability.  Several risk factors apply tothe analysis of the potential growth of transaction revenue.        There is significant  competitive pressure brought on by a proliferationof electronic  execution  competitors.  There is the potential for change in thecurrent  US market  structure  that may make it  difficult  for the  transactionbusiness to compete with more traditional  broker-dealer  business  models.  Forexample, the NYSE could establish limits on electronic access, or the NYSE couldcreate an electronic matching order engine of its own.                                       69                                   NYFIX, INC.        Customer   demands  for  increased   bandwidth  and  speed  could  placesignificant stress on our  infrastructure  requiring  continued  reinvestment inhardware  and  software to keep pace with overall  business  growth.  We have nocurrent plans to transition from the subscription or  transaction-based  revenuemodel due to general  acceptance of it in the  marketplace and the current trendof recurring, predictable revenue recognition and cash flows.NYSE AND SEC SPECIFIC REGULATORY CHANGES MAY IMPAIR OUR REVENUE.        We provide  our floor  broker  technology  services to major NYSE memberfirms and a large  group of $2  brokers.  The NYSE is  proposing  to update  thesecurities trading rules related to the DOT system services of NYSE Direct + andNYSE  Institutional  Express.  Both  of  these  services  are  electronic  tradeexecution services that NYSE has created to compete,  mainly with ECNs and otherfully electronic marketplaces.        If the  extended  functionality  and  access to either  one or both NYSEDirect + and  NYSE  Institutional  Express  are  successful,  this may lead to alesser need to utilize floor  brokers and clerks to execute  trades on the NYSE.This situation would proportionally  reduce the need for floor booth technology.This  situation  is a risk to the NYFIX  subscription  revenue that is generatedfrom existing  operations.  This situation  also is a risk to estimating  futuregrowth in the  subscription  revenue  from floor  booth  technology  provided byNYFIX.        We would be most impacted if the NYSE proposed  changes happen in a verysudden  timeframe  and create an  immediate  consolidation  of large NYSE memberfirms and  independent  member firms. We are aware that both types of firms havebeen  operating  under  sustained  financial  pressure due to market  conditionsduring  2001 to present.  We  anticipate  that many member  firms both large andsmall could become insolvent within months if the given changes do make the NYSEmore  electronically  accessible  and reduce  order flow to the floor  brokeragegroups.WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT  OUR  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  RIGHTS,  WHICH COULDWEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND INCREASE OUR COSTS.        Our success and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degreeon our intellectual  property rights, which include our proprietary  technology,trade secrets and customer base. However, no one patent, trademark or other formof intellectual property rights is critical to our business.        Despite  our  efforts to protect our  proprietary  rights,  unauthorizedparties  may  attempt  to copy or  otherwise  obtain  and  use our  products  ortechnology.  Monitoring  unauthorized  use of our products is  difficult  and wecannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent  unauthorized use ofour technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protectour proprietary rights as fully as in the US. If competitors are able to use ourtechnology,  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.  Litigation maybe  necessary  in the future to enforce our  intellectual  property  rights,  toprotect  our  trade  secrets,  to  determine  the  validity  and  scope  of  theproprietary  rights of others,  or to defend against claims of  infringement  orinvalidity.  Litigation,  whether or not successful, could result in substantialcosts and diversions of resources.WE MAY FACE CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY  RIGHTS,  WHICH COULD HARM OURBUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.        Third parties may assert claims that we are infringing their proprietaryrights.  If  infringement  claims  are  asserted  against  us,  we  could  incursignificant  costs in defending those claims.  We may be required to discontinueusing and selling any infringing technology and services, to expend resources todevelop  non-infringing  technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties forother technology.  We may be unable to acquire licenses for the other technologyon reasonable  commercial terms or at all. As a result,  we may find that we areunable to continue to offer the services  and  products  upon which our businessdepends.                                       70                                   NYFIX, INC.THE SECURITIES BROKERAGE INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.IF  NYFIX  MILLENNIUM,  NYFIX  TRANSACTION  SERVICES,  NYFIX  CLEARING  OR NYFIXINTERNATIONAL  FAIL TO COMPLY  WITH  THESE  REGULATIONS,  THEY MAY BE SUBJECT TODISCIPLINARY OR OTHER ACTION BY REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS.        We are subject to extensive government  regulation and may be subject todisciplinary  or other action by regulatory  organizations  if we fail to complywith such regulation, which could increase our capital expenditures and decreaseour earnings.        NYFIX  Millennium,  NYFIX  Transaction  Services and NYFIX  Clearing aresubject to  extensive  regulation  under both  Federal  and state laws and NYFIXInternational  is subject to extensive  regulation under UK laws. In addition tothese laws, we must comply with rules of the SEC,  including  Regulation ATS forNYFIX Millennium,  and the NASD, FSA, various stock exchanges,  state securitiescommissions and other regulatory  bodies charged with safeguarding the integrityof the  securities  markets  and other  financial  markets  and  protecting  theinterests  of  investors   participating   in  these   markets.   As  registeredbroker-dealers, NYFIX Millennium, NYFIX Transaction Services, NYFIX Clearing andNYFIX International are subject to numerous  regulations covering the securitiesbusiness, including:        o    marketing practices;        o    capital structure, including net capital requirements;        o    record keeping; and        o    conduct of directors, officers and employees.        Any  failure  to comply  with  these  regulations  could  subject  NYFIXMillennium, NYFIX Transaction Services, NYFIX Clearing or NYFIX International tocensure,  fines,  the  issuance of  cease-and-desist  orders or the  suspension,and/or disqualification of its officers,  directors or employees.  The fines, ifmaterial,  could have an adverse effect on our earnings because it could greatlyincrease our capital  expenditures.  If any of our employees  were  suspended ordisqualified,  we may be unable to meet the needs of our customers or to solicitnew  business.  This  could  also  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  earnings.Furthermore,  any such  penalties  could  materially  harm our reputation in theindustry, which could have a long-term effect on our financial growth.NYFIX  MILLENNIUM,   NYFIX  TRANSACTION   SERVICES,   NYFIX  CLEARING  OR  NYFIXINTERNATIONAL MAY NOT HAVE EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT METHODS.        NYFIX Millennium's,  NYFIX Transaction  Services',  NYFIX Clearing's andNYFIX International's  ability to comply with regulations depends largely on theestablishment  and  maintenance of an effective  compliance  system,  as well astheir  ability  to attract  and retain  qualified  compliance  personnel.  NYFIXMillennium,  NYFIX Transaction  Services,  NYFIX Clearing or NYFIX Internationalcould be subject to disciplinary  or other actions due to claimed  noncompliancewith  regulations  in the  future.  If a  claim  of  noncompliance  is made by aregulatory authority,  the efforts of the management of NYFIX Millennium,  NYFIXTransaction Services, NYFIX Clearing or NYFIX International could be diverted toresponding  to such  claim  and they  could be  subject  to a range of  possibleconsequences,  including the payment of fines, civil lawsuits and the suspensionof one or more  portions of its business.  In addition,  their mode of operationand profitability may be directly affected by:        o    additional legislation;        o    changes in rules  promulgated  by the SEC,  the NASD,  the FSA, the             Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the various stock             exchanges or other self-regulatory organizations; or        o    changes in the  interpretation  or enforcement of existing laws and             rules.                                       71                                   NYFIX, INC.        In addition, NYFIX Millennium's status as a recognized ATS requires thatits trade  execution  and  communication  systems be able to handle  anticipatedpresent and future peak trading volumes.  If any of our systems become disabled,the  ability  to  process  trades  and  handle  peak  trading  volumes  will  becompromised.  The status of NYFIX  Millennium and NYFIX Clearing  Corporation asSEC registered broker-dealers and NASD members and NYFIX International as an FSAregistered  broker-dealer are conditioned,  in part, on their ability to processand settle trades.OUR BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE RESTRICTED IN THEIR OPERATIONS SHOULD THEYFAIL TO MEET THEIR MINIMUM AND MINIMUM EXCESS NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.        Our NYFIX  Millennium,  NYFIX Transaction  Services,  NYFIX Clearing andNYFIX International broker-dealer subsidiaries,  individually,  have to maintaincertain  minimum  net capital and  minimum  excess net capital  requirements  asmandated  by  certain  regulatory  agencies.  Some of  these  requirements  varyaccording to the  profitability of the  broker-dealer  and rise as profitabilityfalls. At December 31, 2004, our broker-dealers in the aggregate had minimum netcapital  and minimum  excess net  capital  requirements  of $11.0  million.  Ourbroker-dealer  operations  may need  additional  funds in the future to maintaintheir minimum and minimum excess net capital requirements. At December 31, 2004,we had cash and short-term investments of $12.9 million that were not subject toour   broker-dealer   minimum  net  capital  and  minimum   excess  net  capitalrequirements.  In the first quarter of 2005, we provided an aggregate additionalcapital of $2.8 million in the form of additional capital contributions.  If ourbroker-dealers   fall  below  their  minimum  and  minimum  excess  net  capitalrequirements,   their   operations  would  be  restricted  by  their  respectiveregulatory agencies.OUR  BROKER-DEALER  SUBSIDIARIES ARE AT RISK IF THEIR CUSTOMERS DEFAULT ON THEIRTRADING OBLIGATIONS.        Under  applicable  regulatory   requirements,   our  broker-dealers  arerequired  to cover for  their  customers  if their  customers  default  on theirtrading  obligations by improperly  failing to deliver cash or securities on thedate when a trade settles.  The broker-dealer can pursue its customer for lossesthe  broker-dealer  sustains by delivering the required cash or securities.  Ourbroker-dealers  attempt to manage the risks  associated  with  customer  tradingdefaults  by  conducting  a number  of  background  checks  on their  customers,including   financial  history,   credit,   regulatory  and  legal  checks.  Thebroker-dealer  decides  which  background  checks  to  undertake  based  on  therelationship  with the customer  and the nature and extent of the business  thatthe customer has with the broker-dealer. In addition, our broker-dealers monitortrades to check that  counterparties  know and confirm trades before  settlementdate to minimize market risk to which our  broker-dealers can be exposed betweentrade date and settlement date. Despite these measures to reduce the risk to ourbroker-dealers  from  trading  defaults  by  their  customers,  there  can be noassurance  that our  broker-dealers  will avoid such risks  entirely  or that iflosses do occur they will not have a material impact on the financial  conditionor reputation of the affected broker-dealer.NYFIX  CLEARING MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CLEAR TRADES DUE TO MAXIMUM LIMITS IMPOSED BYTHE DTCC AND THE NEED FOR INTRA-DAY FUNDING COMMITMENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES.        NYFIX  Clearing is restricted to a maximum limit imposed by the DTCC. Inaddition,  to be  able  to  clear  trades,  NYFIX  Clearing  may  require  addedcommitments from  unaffiliated  institutions to provide funding during a tradingday ("intra-day funding").  An inability to maintain or raise its maximum limitsor to obtain and maintain  third-party  commitments to support intra-day fundingcould have an adverse impact on NYFIX  Clearing's  ability to maintain or expandits business.                                       72                                   NYFIX, INC.THE  ABILITY OF NYFIX  CLEARING  TO  MAINTAIN  OR EXPAND ITS  BUSINESS  COULD BEADVERSELY  IMPACTED IF IT DID NOT  CONTINUE TO HAVE  THIRD-PARTY  ASSISTANCE  TOACCESS EXCHANGES AND OTHER IMPORTANT TRADING VENUES.        NYFIX  Clearing  provides  clearing  and  settlement  services  with theassistance of third parties who provide NYFIX  Clearing  access to exchanges andother important trading venues in the execution business. If such third parties,exchanges or regulators  determine  that NYFIX  Clearing must  discontinue  suchindirect access,  this could have an adverse impact on NYFIX Clearing's  abilityto maintain or expand its business.WE MAY LACK THE  CAPITAL  REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN  OUR  COMPETITIVE  POSITION OR TOSUSTAIN OUR GROWTH.        We have  historically  relied on cash flow from  operations and proceedsfrom equity and debt to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion.If we are unable to obtain  sufficient  capital in the  future,  we may face thefollowing risks, including not being able to:        o    continue to meet customer demand for service quality,  availability             and competitive pricing;        o    expand or to acquire complementary businesses; and        o    develop new  services  or  otherwise  respond to changing  business             conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures.WE MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO MEET DEMANDS RESULTING FROM GROWTH.        Growth may strain our management  systems and resources.  We may need tomake additional investments in the following areas:        o    recruitment and training;        o    communications and information systems;        o    sales and marketing;        o    facilities and other infrastructure;        o    treasury and accounting functions;        o    licensing and acquisition of technology and rights; and        o    employee and customer relations and management.        If we fail to develop systems, procedures and controls to handle currentand future growth on a timely basis,  we may be less efficient in the managementof our business or encounter difficulties  implementing our strategy,  either ofwhich could harm our results of operations.CONDUCTING  BUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL  MARKETS SUBJECTS US TO ADDITIONAL  RISKS.ALSO, OUR STRATEGY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS  INTERNATIONALLY  MAY FAIL,  WHICH MAYIMPEDE OUR GROWTH AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS.        For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 13%,10% and 7%,  respectively,  of our revenue was  derived  from our  internationaloperations.  We believe international revenue will be an important component forour future  success.  Thus, we are subject to various risks in doing business ininternational markets, including:        o    difficulties  in recruiting,  training and retaining  personnel and             managing   and   implementing   existing   and  new   international             operations;        o    localizing   our  products  to  target  the   specific   needs  and             preferences  of  foreign  customers,  which  may  differ  from  our             traditional customer base in the US;                                       73                                   NYFIX, INC.        o    building our brand name and awareness of our services among foreign             customers;        o    competition with existing market  participants  which have a longer             history in and  greater  familiarity  with the  foreign  markets we             enter;        o    laws and business practices that can favor local competitors;        o    fluctuations in currency exchange rates;        o    imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign  currencies into             US dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign             subsidiaries; and        o    changes in a specific  country's or region's  political or economic             conditions.        If we fail  adequately to address the  challenges  and risks  associatedwith our international  operations and expansion,  we may encounter difficultiesimplementing  our strategy,  which could impede our growth or harm our operatingresults.OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES  AND GROW OUR BUSINESS  COULD BESIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF KEY PERSONNEL.        Our business is highly dependent on a number of key executive  officers,including Peter K. Hansen,  our founder,  Chief Executive Officer and President,and Lars Kragh, our Chief Information  Officer,  who have been with us since ourinception in 1991.  The loss of the services of any of our key  personnel  couldhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.RECENTLY  ENACTED AND PROPOSED CHANGES IN SECURITIES LAWS ARE LIKELY TO INCREASEOUR COSTS.        Sarbanes-Oxley,  as well as new rules  subsequently  implemented  by theSEC, has required changes in certain of our corporate  governance and accountingpractices.  In addition, the NASDAQ has promulgated a number of regulations.  Weexpect these laws,  rules and  regulations  to increase our legal and  financialcompliance costs and to make some activities more difficult,  time consuming andcostly. We also expect these new rules and regulations to make it more difficultand more expensive for us to obtain  director and officer  liability  insurance,and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur significantly  highercosts to obtain coverage.  These new laws, rules and regulations could also makeit more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board ofdirectors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executiveofficers.TERRORIST THREATS AND ATTACKS AND THE SITUATION IN IRAQ HAVE CREATED SIGNIFICANTINSTABILITY  AND  UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL  MARKETPLACE TO WHICH WE SELL ANDMAY CREATE A MORE VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT.        The terrorist  attacks in the US on September 11, 2001, the  declarationof war by the US  against  terrorism  and the  current  situation  in Iraq  havecreated  significant  instability and uncertainty in the financial  marketplace,both in the US and globally.  Such adverse political events may have a continuednegative  impact on economic  conditions  in the financial  marketplace  and ourcustomers.  The  unfavorable  conditions  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on ourfinancial  operations  including,  but not limited to, our ability to expand themarket for our products,  enter into  strategic  relationships  and  effectivelycompete.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKINTEREST RATES        Market risk  generally  represents the risk of loss that may be expectedto result  from the  potential  change in value of a financial  instrument  as aresult of fluctuations in credit ratings of the issuer, equity prices,  interestrates or foreign  currency  exchange rates.  We do not use derivative  financialinstruments for any purpose.                                       74                                   NYFIX, INC.        We are exposed to market risk  principally  through  changes in interestrates and equity prices. Our short and long-term  investment  portfolios of $4.5million and $3.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively,  consistedof $1.2 million and $2.4 million,  respectively,  of auction rate  certificates.Risk is limited on the auction rate certificates  portfolio due to the fact thatit is invested in insured municipal bonds. The potential  decrease in fair valueresulting from a hypothetical  10% change in interest rates for the auction ratecertificates  would not be material to the results of operations  and cash flowsor their fair value.        We are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk on our $3.3  million  and $1.0million  of  treasury  bills at  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively.  Ahypothetical  10% change in interest rates would not result in a material changein their fair value.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK        Our earnings are affected by  fluctuations in the value of the US dollaras compared with foreign  currencies,  which are primarily the British pound andthe Euro, due to our operations in the United Kingdom and Europe.        We manage  foreign  currency risk through the structure of our business.In the substantial majority of our transactions, we receive payments denominatedin the US dollar, British pounds sterling or the Euro. Therefore, we do not relyon  international  currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid  currencies.  Theforeign  currency  exposure  that  does  exist is  limited  by the fact that themajority of transactions are paid according to our standard payment terms, whichare generally  short-term in nature.  For the years ended  December 31, 2004 and2003, we recorded a foreign  exchange  translation gain of $0.1 million and $0.3million, respectively.SECURITIES MARKET AND CREDIT RISK        NYFIX  Clearing is subject to market risk when a  counterparty  does notdeliver cash or securities to it as expected and NYFIX  Clearing  holds cash (inlieu of securities)  or securities (in lieu of cash) at any point in time.  Thisrisk arises from the potential inability of the counterparty's clearing agent tomeet its settlement  obligation by delivering  cash or securities,  as required,which is a credit  risk.  NYFIX  Clearing  is a member of several  highly  ratedclearing organizations, which have margin requirements and other mechanisms thatare designed to substantially mitigate this risk.        When necessary,  NYFIX Clearing can liquidate or purchase  securities inthe market to close out the  position  at the  prevailing  market  price.  NYFIXClearing's  stock  lending  practice is to maintain  collateral in excess of thecontract value and to request additional  collateral whenever  necessary.  NYFIXClearing seeks  high-quality,  creditworthy  counterparties  and has controls inplace that are designed to monitor and limit this exposure.ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
