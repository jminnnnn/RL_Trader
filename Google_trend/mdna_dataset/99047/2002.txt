ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND        RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESManagement's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results ofOperations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements, which havebeen prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requiresmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts ofassets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilitiesat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues andexpenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluatesits  estimates and  judgments,  including  those related to accounts  receivablereserves,   investments,   long-lived  assets,   revenue  recognition,   productenhancement  costs,  income  taxes  and  contingencies.   Management  bases  itsestimates and judgments on  historical  experience  and on various other factorsthat are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of whichform the basis for  making  judgments  about the  carrying  values of assets andliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results maydiffer from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Management  believes the following critical accounting  policies,  among others,affect its more  significant  judgments and estimates used in the preparation ofits  consolidated  financial  statements.  For  a  detailed  discussion  on  theapplication of these and other accounting  policies,  see Note 2 in the Notes tothe Consolidated  Financial  Statements in Item 14 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RESERVESThe Company  continuously  monitors  collections and payments from our customersand maintains a provision for estimated  credit losses based upon our historicalexperience and any specific customer  collection issues that we have identified.While  such  credit  losses  have   historically   been  within  the  provisionsestablished,  we cannot  guarantee  that we will continue to experience the samecredit loss rates that we have in the past.  If the  financial  condition of theCompany's  customers  were to  deteriorate,  resulting in an impairment of theirability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.                                       20 INVESTMENTSThe Company holds an ownership interest in NYFIX Millennium, 50% at December 31,2001, and 80% effective  February 1, 2002. The Company's  policy is to record aninvestment  impairment  charge when it believes an investment has  experienced adecline in value that is other than temporary.  Future adverse changes in marketconditions,  poor operating  results or a failure of the business model of NYFIXMillennium  could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying valueof the  investments,  thereby  possibly  requiring an  impairment  charge in thefuture.LONG-LIVED ASSETSThe Company periodically reviews the carrying value of our long-lived assets andinvestments  for  continued  appropriateness.  This  review  is  based  upon ourprojections  of  anticipated  future  cash  flows.  While  we  believe  that ourestimates of future cash flows are reasonable,  different  assumptions regardingsuch cash flows could materially affect our evaluations.REVENUE RECOGNITIONThe  Company's  revenues  comprise  subscription,  sales  and  service  contractrevenue.  Sales are  generally  recorded  upon  shipment  of the  product to andacceptance by customers. Sales revenue, which is comprised of software sales andcapital  equipment  sales,  is generated  primarily by sales to customers in thefutures,  options and currencies trading market.  Subscription revenue contractsare primarily with brokerage  firms,  international  banks and global  exchangestrading in equities,  and are  generally  for an initial  period of one to threeyears with one to three year renewal periods. Subscription revenue is recognizedratably over the life of the  subscription  agreements with customers and beginsonce  installation is complete.  Revenue from service  contracts is comprised ofmaintenance contracts for capital sales equipment and subscription equipment andis recognized ratably over the period the services are performed. Amounts billedin advance for service and subscription  contracts are deferred and reflected asadvance billings.PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT COSTSThe Company's policy on product  enhancements costs determines the timing of ourrecognition of certain  development  costs. In addition,  this policy determineswhether the cost is classified  as deferred  product  enhancements  costs on ourbalance sheet or research and development expense. Management is required to useprofessional judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteriafor immediate expense or  capitalization,  as well as the determination of whichenhancements significantly enhance the functionality or significantly extend thelife of our products.  The  establishment of  technological  feasibility and theongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized  software  development costsrequire  judgment  by  management  with  respect  to certain  external  factors,including  but not limited  to,  anticipated  future  gross  revenue,  estimatedeconomic  life,  customer  requirements  and  changes in software  and  hardwaretechnologies.INCOME TAXESThe Company's income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects oftemporary  differences  between  the tax bases of  assets  and  liabilities  andamounts reported in the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets.  The Companyevaluates the  recoverability  of tax assets  recorded on the balance sheets andprovides allowances as required.CONTINGENCIESContingencies  are recorded as liabilities  when it is probable that a liabilityhas been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Disclosureis required when there is a reasonable  possibility  that the ultimate loss willexceed the recorded provision.  The Company uses outside counsel to assist it invarious                                       21 matters  including  securities and Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")regulations,  acquisitions,  trademark, patent and personnel matters. Managementrelies on the  professional  judgment  of  outside  counsel  and well as its ownassessment in determining whether contingencies should be recorded.OVERVIEWThe  Company's  revenues  comprise  subscription,  sales  and  service  contractrevenue. Consistent with the Company's transition to a subscription sales model,subscription  fees represent a majority and increasing  share of total revenues.Subscription revenue contracts are primarily with brokerage firms, internationalbanks and global exchanges trading in equities, and are generally for an initialperiod  of  one  to  three  years  with  one  to  three  year  renewal  periods.Subscription  revenues are recognized ratably over the lives of the subscriptionagreements  with  customers  and begin  once  installation  is  complete.  Salesrevenue,  which is comprised of software sales and capital  equipment  sales, isgenerated primarily by sales to customers in the futures, options and currenciestrading market, and is recognized upon shipment of the product and acceptance bythe customer. Service contract revenue is comprised of maintenance contracts forcapital sales  equipment and  subscription  equipment and is recognized  ratablyover the  period  that the  service is  provided.  Service  contract  revenue onsubscription  contracts is charged to customers  as a fixed  percentage  of suchcontracts.Cost of revenues  principally  consists  of  subscription  communication  lines,amortization  of  capitalized  product  enhancement  costs and  depreciation  ofsubscription-based equipment, labor, materials and overhead.Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  account for the majority of theCompany's  operating  expenses  and consist of salaries and  benefits,  rent andoffice  expenses,  non-customer  specific  communication  fees,  provisions  fordoubtful  accounts and marketing  expenses.  During the past several years,  theCompany has expanded its efforts to support an increasing number of services andto increase the number of exchanges, brokerage firms and "buy-side" institutionsconnecting  to  the  NYFIX  Network.  Management  believes  that  its  continuedinvestment  in  the   development   of  the  NYFIX  system  and  its  associatedapplications  and  services  has  increased  order  flow,  which in turn  shouldfacilitate both revenue growth and further distribution of its products.Research  and  development  expenses  relate  to  developing  new  products  andtechnologies  to meet the current and future needs of the  Company's  customers.These costs  consist  primarily of salaries and related  costs for technical andprogramming personnel.Depreciation and amortization  expense consists of depreciation and amortizationof equipment and software used to operate the Company's systems.The following  discussion and analysis  should be read in  conjunction  with theconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  Historical results are notnecessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000REVENUESSubscription  revenue  increased 81% to $28,955,000 in 2001, from $15,955,000 in2000, principally due to increased demand among existing customers, and also theaddition of new  customers  and new product  offerings  sold to existing and newcustomers. As a percentage of total revenues,  subscription revenue increased to70% in 2001 from 67% in 2000.Sales revenue  increased 60% to $8,123,000 in 2001, from $5,089,000 in 2000. Theincrease  in  sales  revenue  is  principally  due to  customer  demand  for theCompany's Order Book Management  System ("OBMS")  derivatives  trading  softwareproducts and the sale of equity technology fees, offset in part by a decrease inhardware sales. As a percentage of total revenue, sales revenue decreased to 20%in 2001, from 21% in 2000, with software sales  comprising the majority of salesrevenue.Service  contracts  revenue increased 47% to $4,319,000 in 2001, from $2,936,000in 2000,  principally due to an                                       22 increase in  subscription  contract  revenue.  As a percentage of total revenue,service contract revenue  comprised 10% of total revenue,  as compared to 12% in2000.COST OF REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITGross profit as a percentage of total revenues increased to 77% in 2001 from 73%in 2000, as gross profit on a percentage  basis  improved for both  subscriptionand sales revenues. The increase in gross profit percentage principally resultedfrom an increase in the amount of higher  margin  software  installations.  On adollar basis, gross profit improved for all three revenue categories,  which wasoffset somewhat by increased communication charges relating to increased desktopconnections,  higher labor costs due to  increased  service  contract  revenues,increased   depreciation  expense  for   subscription-based   equipment  due  toadditional  units being placed into service and higher  amortization  expense ofproduct enhancement costs. Included in cost of revenues was amortization expenseof product  enhancement  costs of $1,773,000  and  $1,185,000 for 2001 and 2000,respectively.  Also  included in cost of revenues was  depreciation  expense forsubscription-based  equipment of $2,060,000  and  $1,257,000  for 2001 and 2000,respectively.  The Company  obtains its materials and supplies from a variety ofvendors  in the U.S.  and  Asia and did not  experience  any  significant  priceincreases in its component parts purchased during 2001.SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVESelling,  general and  administrative  expenses  increased 68% to $15,841,000 in2001, from  $9,419,000 in 2000, but decreased  slightly as a percentage of totalrevenues to 38% in 2001 from 39% in 2000. The dollar increase reflects increasedsalaries and  commissions,  related  personnel  costs,  rent expense and variousoffice  expenses  due to an  increase in  personnel  of 24% in 2001 from 2000 tosupport the Company's growth. Also increasing were non-recoverable communicationfees, and software  support and  maintenance  contract fees due to the continuedinvestment in the Company's infrastructure.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTResearch and development  expenses  decreased to $452,000 in 2001, from $454,000in 2000,  primarily as a result of the Company's focus on enhancing its existingproduct lines to allow current and  prospective  customers to be more  efficientand productive in their  businesses.  As stated above,  amortization  of productenhancement costs is reflected in cost of revenues.DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATIONDepreciation  and  amortization  expenses  increased 110% to $2,633,000 in 2001,from $1,255,000 in 2000, reflecting  principally the continued investment in theCompany's  infrastructure,  in addition to administrative  support equipment andleasehold improvements to support the Company's growth.INTEREST EXPENSEInterest  expense  increased  3% to  $343,000  in 2001,  from  $333,000 in 2000,principally  as a result of increased  interest on capital lease  obligations of$126,000,  offset by a $116,000  decrease in other  interest  expense due to thepayoff of the Company's line of credit during July 2001.INVESTMENT INCOMEInvestment  income  increased  400% to $780,000 in 2001,  from $156,000 in 2000,principally due to interest and dividends earned on the Company's investments incash equivalents and marketable securities.PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESThe provision for income taxes increased to $5,427,000 in 2001, from $601,000 in2000.  Commencing in 2001, the Company is subject to full  statutory  income taxrates as  compared  to the prior  periods  in which  the  Company  utilized  thebenefits of available net operating loss carryforwards.  The Company's effectivetax rate of 40% in the current year exceeds the Federal statutory rate primarilydue to state income taxes.EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11THThe  events  of  September  11,  2001,  did not have a  material  effect  on theCompany's financial position,  results of operations,  or cash flows. Managementbelieves  that these events have not impacted our overall  growth  outlook.                                       23 The  Company  credits  the  ongoing  investment  in  state-of-the-art  redundantdata-centers  and  network  infrastructure  for our  ability  to  maintain  100%effective  operations  across all products and services  throughout the month ofSeptember.  While the Company  worked around the clock to assist many clients inrecovery testing, and in some cases establishing temporary emergency operations,the Company opted not to charge any customers  one-time fees in connection  withthese efforts.  The Company also did not incur any material incremental expensesin connection with the events of September 11, 2001.Although the events of September 11, 2001 did not have a direct  material effecton the  Company's  results of  operations,  they did have an effect on the NYFIXMillennium  Alternative  Trading  System  (ATS),  which  the  Company  had a 50%ownership  interest at December 31, 2001. After roll-out efforts were stalled bythe tragic events of September 11th,  NYFIX  Millennium usage increased later inthe fourth quarter, bringing the system back to initial execution levels.YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999REVENUESSubscription  revenue  increased 137% to $15,955,000 in 2000, from $6,733,000 in1999,  principally due to increased desktop placements among existing customers,and also  the  addition  of new  customers  and new  product  offerings  sold toexisting and new  customers.  As a percentage  of total  revenues,  subscriptionrevenue increased to 67% in 2000 from 55% in 1999.Sales revenue  increased 37% to $5,089,000 in 2000, from $3,715,000 in 1999. Theincrease  in  sales  revenue  is  principally  due to  customer  demand  for theCompany's OBMS derivatives  trading software products.  As a percentage of totalrevenue,  sales  revenue  decreased to 21% in 2000,  from 30% in 1999,  which isconsistent with the Company's  transition to a  subscription-based  model,  withsoftware sales comprising the majority of sales revenue.Service  contracts  revenue increased 67% to $2,936,000 in 2000, from $1,761,000in 1999,  principally due to an increase in subscription  contract  revenue.  In2000,  service contract revenue  comprised 12% of total revenue,  as compared to14% in 1999.COST OF REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITGross profit as a percentage of total revenues increased to 73% in 2000 from 69%in 1999. The increase in gross profit  percentage  principally  resulted from anincrease in the amount of higher  margin  software  installations  and  improvedpricing on  communication  charges  relating  to  subscription  agreements.  TheCompany obtains its materials and supplies from a variety of vendors in the U.S.and Far East and did not  experience  any  significant  price  increases  in itscomponent  parts  purchased  during  2000.  Included  in  cost of  revenues  wasamortization expense of product enhancement costs of $1,185,000 and $719,000 for2000 and 1999, respectively.  Also included in cost of revenues was depreciationexpense for subscription-based equipment of $1,257,000 and $586,000 for 2000 and1999, respectively.SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVESelling,  general and  administrative  expenses  increased  50% to $9,419,000 in2000,  from  $6,290,000 in 1999, but decreased as a percentage of total revenuesto 39% in  2000  from  52% in  1999.  The  dollar  increase  reflects  increasedsalaries,  related personnel costs, rent expense and various office expenses dueto personnel  increases to support the Company's  growth.  Also  increasing werenon-recoverable  communication  fees,  and bad  debt  expense  primarily  due tocertain independent brokers going out of business during 2000.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTResearch  and  development  expenses  increased  53% to $454,000  in 2000,  from$297,000  in 1999,  as the  Company  continued  to  research  ways to expand itsproduct portfolio.DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATIONDepreciation and amortization  expenses increased 89% to $1,255,000 in 2000 from$663,000  in  1999,                                       24 reflecting principally the continued investment in the Company's infrastructure.INTEREST EXPENSEInterest  expense  increased  50% to  $333,000 in 2000,  from  $222,000 in 1999,principally  as a result of capital  lease  obligations  entered into during theperiod and higher average  balances  outstanding on the Company's line of creditdue to the draw down of an additional $700,000 in August 1999, offset in part byrepayment of the principal of $83,000 a month commencing in July 2000.INVESTMENT INCOMEInvestment  income  increased  38% to $156,000 in 2000,  from  $113,000 in 1999,principally due to higher average cash balances maintained by the Company duringthe year ended December 31, 2000 versus the comparable period in 1999.PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESThe  provision for income taxes  increased to $601,000 in 2000,  from $94,000 in1999.  As of  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  established  a full  valuationallowance of  $2,010,000  for its  deferred  tax assets based upon  management'sdetermination  of the amount that would  ultimately be realized.  Based upon thecontinued  profitability  of the Company during 2000 as well as expected  futureprofitability,  management  determined as of December 31, 2000, that a valuationallowance was no longer required.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESIn June 2001, the Company raised $57,284,000 from a follow-on public offering of3,000,000 shares of its common stock, net of expenses.  The Company is using thenet proceeds for working capital, to purchase shares of its common stock and forother general corporate purposes. The Company is also using a portion of the netproceeds  for  acquisitions  of  businesses,  products and  technologies  or theestablishment  of joint  ventures that are  complementary  to our  business.  Asdescribed  in  Note  21 to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  SubsequentEvents,  the Company is  committed  to expend  funds of  $15,000,000  on certainacquisitions  subsequent to year-end. The funds have come or will come primarilyfrom liquidating available-for-sale marketable securities. At December 31, 2001,the cash and cash equivalents balance increased to $4,968,000 from $4,867,000 atDecember  31,  2000  primarily  as a result  of net  proceeds  from  the  publicoffering,  the  exercise  of  stock  options  and  cash  provided  by  operatingactivities,  offset by purchases of available-for-sale marketable securities andtreasury stock, capital  expenditures,  a subordinated loan to NYFIX Millennium,the  acquisition  of other assets to support the  Company's  infrastructure  andrepayments under loan and capital lease obligations.On March 6, 2002,  the Company  announced  that it had acquired a 40%  ownershipinterest in EuroLink Network, Inc. ("EuroLink"),  a privately held company basedin Madrid,  Spain,  which offers  direct  electronic  access to the U.S.  equitymarkets  from Europe.  The Company  acquired its interest in return for grantinglicensing  and  distribution  rights  and  $4,000,000.  Under  the  terms of theagreement, EuroLink will offer the Company's equity terminals, market access andservices to the European marketplace,  primarily on a transaction fee basis. Theterms of the  agreement  give the Company the option to increase  its  ownershipinterest in EuroLink to 80% at a later date.On March  12,  2002,  the  Company  announced  that it had  signed a  definitiveagreement to acquire Javelin  Technologies,  Inc. ("Javelin").  Javelin,  widelyknown as one of the pioneers in FIX (Financial  Information  exchange  Protocol)technology,  has over  1,000  installations  at more  than 300  leading  buy andsell-side institutions,  exchanges and ECNs, including over 50 clients in Europeand 20 in Asia.  Javelin  possesses  the leading  market-share  in the  buy-sideinstitutional  market for  electronic  order routing  enabling  technology.  TheCompany  will  finance  the  transaction  with a  combination  of  approximately$11,000,000  cash and the issuance of common stock with a value of approximately$44,000,000.  The cash  portion will be financed  through  available  funds.  Inaddition,  the  Company  has  negotiated  an earn-out  based on  Javelin's  2002revenues. The transaction is scheduled to close on March 31, 2002.                                       25 Some of the Company's key considerations for the acquisition of Javelin include:increased  connectivity  to  the  buy-side  institutional  market;  consolidatedproduct offering; cross-selling of core products and transaction services; and asingle  point of  electronic  exchange  access  across  all major  domestic  andinternational  equity  and  derivatives  exchanges.  The plan is to embed  NYFIXMillennium capabilities in Javelin products,  which should reduce implementationtime of the NYFIX Millennium ATS throughout the financial industry.As a  result  of the  Company's  acquisition  of an  inactive  broker-dealer  inDecember 2001,  subsequently  named NYFIX  Transaction  Services,  Inc., and theagreement with EuroLink noted above, the Company expects to record transactionalrevenue beginning in 2002. NYFIX Transaction Services is ready to move into fulloperational  status  immediately  upon NASD  approval of its pending  membershipapplication.  If NASD  broker-dealer  status is  granted  by early in the secondquarter of 2002, NYFIX  Transaction  Services is expected to make a contributionto earnings in the second  quarter and beyond.  In addition,  as a result of theCompany's  increase in ownership interest in NYFIX Millennium to 80% on February1, 2002 (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company willbegin consolidating NYFIX Millennium's financial results effective on that date.Although NYFIX Millennium is experiencing  increasing volumes and increasing itsrevenues,  it is not expected to have a significant impact on first quarter 2002results.  The Company expects NYFIX  Millennium to make solid  contributions  toearnings in the second quarter and beyond.At December 31, 2001, the Company had invested $28,974,000 in current marketablesecurity  instruments,  having  interest  rates  ranging  from  1.30% to  5.05%,$2,214,000 in a tax-free  money fund with an average yield of 0.96% and $552,000in money market funds with a 30 day yield of 1.73%.At December 31, 2001, the Company had total debt of $1,501,000, which representsamounts  outstanding under capital lease obligations.  At December 31, 2001, theCompany  had no  material  commitments  for capital  expenditures  or  inventorypurchases.On July 13,  1998,  the Company  entered  into a  three-year  $3 million line ofcredit agreement with a financial  institution.  Outstanding  indebtedness underthe credit  agreement  bore  interest  at either  LIBOR plus 1.25% or the bank'sprime rate, at the Company's  discretion.  The Company drew down an aggregate of$1,800,000  under the agreement  during 1998 and an additional  $700,000  during1999.  Repayment  of principal  commenced  on July 30, 2000 with twelve  monthlyinstallments  of $83,333 with the  remaining  balance due on July 30, 2001.  TheCompany repaid the remaining balance of $1,500,000 in full on July 17, 2001. Thedebt was personally secured by a non-employee shareholder of the Company and theCompany's   president.

The Company'spresent capital  resources  include  proceeds from internal  operations and fromissuances of common stock.CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIESDuring 2001, net cash provided by operations was  $10,625,000 as compared to netcash provided by operations of $9,432,000 in 2000. The increase is primarily dueto the 43% increase in net earnings,  to $8,136,000 in 2001,  from $5,676,000 in2000.  The  increase is also due to an increase in accounts  payable and accruedexpenses of $2,286,000,  offset by a decrease in advance billings of $5,697,000,an increase in accounts receivable of $1,124,000, and an increase in prepaid andother current assets of $1,292,000.  The increase in accrued  expenses  reflectsincreased tax liabilities due to increased sales and profitability. The decreasein advance  billings  reflects a change in the  Company's  procedure for advancebillings on subscription contracts,  from issuing the invoices at the end of theprior quarter to issuing the invoices at the  beginning of the current  quarter.The increase in accounts  receivable is due primarily to increased  sales offsetby the advance billing method change  described  above.  The increase in prepaidand other  current  assets is due in part to an increase in certain  receivablesfrom telecommunication providers.CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIESDuring 2001 and 2000, net cash used in investing  activities was $48,135,000 and$9,387,000,  respectively.  The  increase is  primarily  due to the  $28,974,000invested in current marketable  securities,  payments for purchases of equipmentrelated to the Company's data center and  subscription  equipment of $7,121,000,payments  related  to  product  enhancement  costs  for  the  Company's  productportfolio  of  $2,806,000,  along with a  subordinated  loan of  $6,000,000  andadvances of $3,237,000 made to NYFIX Millennium.CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIESDuring 2001 and 2000, net proceeds from financing  activities  were  $37,612,000and $3,256,000,  respectively. During 2001, net proceeds of $57,264,000 from thefollow-on public offering and $2,293,000 from the exercise of stock options werepartially  offset by purchases  of treasury  shares of  $19,100,000,  repaymentsunder the revolving  line of credit of $2,000,000  and principal  payments undercapital lease obligations of $846,000.SEASONALITYThe Company  believes  that its  operations  are not  significantly  effected byseasonality.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn June 2001, the FASB issued two new pronouncements: SFAS No. 141 ("SFAS 141"),"Business  Combinations,"  and SFAS No. 142 ("SFAS  142"),  "Goodwill  and OtherIntangible Assets." SFAS 141 prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interest methodfor business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and also applies to allbusiness  combinations  accounted for by the purchase  method that are completedafter June 30, 2001. There are also transition provisions that apply to businesscombinations  completed  before  July 1, 2001,  that were  accounted  for by thepurchase method. SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2001, to all goodwill and other intangible  assets recognized in an entity'sbalance  sheet at that date,  regardless  of when those  assets were  originallyrecognized.  The Company has adopted  SFAS 141 and SFAS 142. As of December  31,2001,  the  Company  did not  have any  goodwill  recorded  on its  consolidatedfinancial  statements,  but will have  goodwill as a result of the  acquisitionsmade  subsequent to year-end (see Note 21). The Company is currently  evaluatingthe impact of SFAS 142 on its consolidated financial statements.                                       27 In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 ("SFAS 144"),  "Accounting for theImpairment of Long-Lived  Assets," which  supercedes  SFAS No. 121 ("SFAS 121"),"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets tobe Disposed  of," and the  accounting  and  reporting  provisions of APB No. 30,"Reporting  the Results of  Operation  - Reporting  the Effects of Disposal of aSegment of a Business,  and  Extraordinary,  Unusual and Infrequently  OccurringEvents and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment of a business.  SFAS 144retains many of the provisions of SFAS 121, but addresses certain implementationissues  associated with that  Statement.  SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal yearsbeginning  after  December 15,  2001.  The Company  adopted  SFAS 144  effectiveJanuary  1,  2002.  The  adoption  of SFAS  144 did not  have an  impact  on thefinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk generally represents the risk of loss that may be expected to resultfrom the  potential  change in value of a  financial  instrument  as a result offluctuations in credit ratings of the issuer,  equity prices,  interest rates orforeign  currency  exchange  rates.  The  Company  is  exposed  to  market  riskprincipally  through  changes in  interest  rates,  equity  prices  and  foreigncurrency  exchange rates.  Interest rate exposure is principally  limited to the$29.0 million of current marketable securities and $5.0 million of cash and cashequivalents  invested at December 31,  2001.  Risk is limited on $9.0 million ofthe  marketable  securities  due to the fact that it is  invested  in an insuredmunicipal bond  portfolio and no more than 5% of the Company's  portfolio can beinvested in any one security issue.The remaining  $20.0 million of current  marketable  securities is invested in aquoted  fund that is managed by an  institution  (the  "Fund")  which  primarilyinvests in investment grade securities,  with up to a maximum of 10% invested inhigh yield securities rated B or higher.The fair value of the  Company's  investment  portfolio  at December  31,  2001,approximated  carrying  value  due to its  short-term  duration.  The  potentialdecrease  in fair value  resulting  from a  hypothetical  10% change in interestrates for the marketable  securities  contained in the investment  portfolio andcash funds would not be material to earnings,  cash flows or fair value. Currentmarketable  securities  at December  31,  2001,  are recorded at a fair value of$29.0  million,  net of an  unrealized  loss of  $60,000.  $20.0  million of thesecurities  has exposure to price risk.  The  estimated  potential  loss in fairvalue  resulting  from a  hypothetical  10% decrease in the quoted price is $2.0million.As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated  financial statements,  the financialstatements of the Company's London sales office are remeasured into U.S. dollarsusing the U.S.  dollar as the functional  currency.  The market risk  associatedwith  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  is not  material  in  relation  to theCompany's consolidated financial position,  results of operations or cash flows.The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for any purpose.ITEM 8.
