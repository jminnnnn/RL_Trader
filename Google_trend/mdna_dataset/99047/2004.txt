ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS        OF OPERATIONS      The purpose of management's discussion and analysis of financial conditionand results of operations  ("MD&A") is to provide an overview of NYFIX, Inc.to help facilitate an understanding of the significant  factors  influencing ourfinancial statements and also to convey our expectations of the potential impactof known trends,  events, or uncertainties  that may impact our future financialstatements. Our MD&A includes forward-looking statements, including, withoutlimitations,  our  expectations.  Our actual results may differ  materially fromthose  expressed  or implied in the  forward-looking  statements  as a result ofvarious  factors  including,  but not limited to,  those  discussed  under "RiskFactors  Relating to Our Business"  below. We assume no obligation to update theforward-looking statements or such risk factors. You should read this discussionin  conjunction  with our  consolidated  financial  statements and related notesincluded in this Report on Form 10-K.OVERVIEW      NYFIX,  founded in 1991 through the acquisition of a New York corporation,is headquartered in Stamford,  Connecticut.  In December 2003, we reincorporatedas a Delaware corporation.      We are an established provider to the domestic and international financialmarkets of trading workstations, middle-office trade automation technologies andtrade  communication  technologies.  Our NYFIX Network is one of the  industry'slargest  networks,  connecting  broker-dealers,  institutions and exchanges.  Inaddition to our headquarters in Stamford,  we have offices on Wall Street in NewYork City, in London's Financial District, in Chicago, and in San Francisco.  Weoperate  three  data  centers  in  the   northeastern   United  States  and  areestablishing additional data center hubs in London and Amsterdam.      We are a provider of trading technology, industry network connectivity andexecution services, offering certain underlying,  universally applicable networkinter-connectivity  products, systems,  facilities, and supporting operations toour two business segments:  our Technology  Services segment and our TransactionServices segment.  These segments,  in turn, package these products and servicesand add others to address the needs of their specific  markets.  We also provideto our  segments  products  specifically  developed  to  support  the  marketingstrategy of that segment. We provide product  development,  systems development,data center and network operations support to our segments.      Our Technology  Services segment is comprised of four of our subsidiaries:NYFIX USA, NYFIX  Overseas,  Javelin,  and  Renaissance.  These  businesses worktogether as technology providers, focusing on offering trade-management systems,a  centralized   industry   order-routing   network,   order-routing   software,exchange-floor  automation  systems,  exchange and market access  technology andpost-trade   processing  systems.  Our  Technology  Services  customers  consistprimarily  of  United  States  securities   brokerage  firms  and  internationalderivatives   brokerage  firms.  Our  Technology   Services  segment   generatessubscription, capital sale and service revenue.      Our Transaction Services segment is comprised of six of our subsidiaries -NYFIX Millennium, NYFIX Transaction Services, and NYFIX Clearing, which are NASDregistered   broker-dealers;   NYFIX   Partners,   which   is  our   introducingbroker-dealer for derivatives and was granted its broker-dealer  license in 2002by the NFA; NYFIX International,  which we incorporated in the United Kingdom onMarch 29,  2004 and  which is  applying  for its FSA  broker-dealer  license  inanticipation of our expansion into European and other international markets; andEuroLink,  of  which  we  acquired  the  remaining  60% we did not  already  owneffective March 29, 2004 and which represented our initial  transaction  effortsin the European markets.                                       32                                    NYFIX, INC.      NYFIX Millennium  provides a modernized  electronic  execution venue underRegulation ATS for trading in United States stocks.  NYFIX Transaction  Servicesprovides  technology  and  direct  market  access  and  execution  links.  NYFIXClearing,  a member of the DTCC,  settles and clears  transactions  on behalf ofNYFIX Millennium and NYFIX  Transaction  Services.  While NYFIX Partners has notinitiated any active business,  we are discussing  opportunities with sponsoringbroker-dealers  and potential  customers for the derivatives  markets to augmentour future business plans.      In recent years,  we have invested  heavily in pursuing a  growth-orientedstrategy and have  organized  those efforts  largely  through our  subsidiaries.After the introduction of our NYFIX Network in 1998, we experienced quarter overquarter  revenue growth from 1999 through 2001.  Thereafter,  as a result of theimpact of the tragic  events of  September  11, 2001 on our customer  base,  thedownturn in the  financial  markets,  and the  fixed-cost  base of our  acquiredcompanies  we have not been able to  generate  sufficient  revenue to offset ouroperating  costs and, thus,  experienced  operating  losses in 2002 and 2003. Webelieve that our decision to continue to invest  during the last two years is animportant factor to help us become better positioned to take advantage of futureopportunities.  We have  actively  pursued  new  customer  market  segments  andproducts  to support  trading  for a variety of  financial  instruments  in moremarkets while increasing our international business opportunities.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES      This MD&A reviews our consolidated  financial  statements,  which havebeen prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America.  These principles require us to make estimates,  basedon assumptions,  which if not accurate,  could  materially  affect our financialstatements,  including  the  assets,  liabilities,  revenue  and expense and thedisclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financialstatements  and future  reporting  periods.  The  markets for our  products  arecharacterized  by  intense  competition,  rapid  technological  development  andpricing  pressures,  all of which  could  affect the future  realization  of ourassets.      Estimates,   including  assumptions  related  to:  the  collectibility  ofaccounts  receivable;  the useful lives of tangible and intangible  assets;  therecoverability  of goodwill;  the  realization  of deferred tax assets;  revenuerecognition;  product  enhancement  costs;  income taxes; and  contingencies arereviewed  periodically  and  the  effects  of  revisions  are  reflected  in theconsolidated  financial  statements  in the  period  they are  determined  to benecessary.  We base our estimates on historical  experience and on various otherfactors and assumptions  that we believe to be reasonable,  the results of whichforms the basis for making  estimates and assumptions  about the carrying valuesof assets and  liabilities  that are not readily  apparent  from other  sources.Actual  results  may differ  materially  from these  estimates  under  differentassumptions.      We believe the  accounting  policies,  described  below,  are  critical tounderstand  our  financial  statements,  due to the  underlying  assumptions  inestimates  we use  applying  such  accounting  policies.  We have  reviewed  thedevelopment and selection of these accounting policies, estimates, including theunderlying  assumptions and the related disclosures in the financial  statementsand this MD&A with our Audit Committee.  Refer to Note 1 in the Notes to theConsolidated  Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor our significant accounting policies.REVENUE RECOGNITION      We  recognize  revenue  in  accordance  with the  SEC's  Staff  AccountingBulletin  ("SAB") No. 101,  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  IN  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS,  asamended by SAB 101A and 101B ("SAB 101") and SAB 104, REVENUE  RECOGNITION.  SAB101  requires  that  four  basic  criteria  must be met  before  revenue  can berecognized:  (1) persuasive  evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery hasoccurred or services have been rendered;  (3) the fee is fixed and determinable;and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.  Determination of criteria (3) and(4) are based on our judgment  regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged forproducts  delivered  and the  collectibility  of those fees.  Should  changes inconditions  cause us to determine  these criteria are not met for certain futuretransactions,  revenue  recognized  for any reporting  period could be adverselyimpacted.                                       33                                    NYFIX, INC.      We  recognize  revenue  from  software  arrangements  in  accordance  withStatement of Position ("SOP") 97-2,  SOFTWARE REVENUE  RECOGNITION as amended bySOP 98-9, MODIFICATION OF SOP 97-2 WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. Revenueis recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery hasoccurred, provided the fee is fixed or determinable,  collectibility is probableand the arrangement does not require  significant  customization or modificationof the software.      We recognize revenue for contracts with multiple  deliverables,  which arenot  covered  under  SOP  97-2,  in  accordance  with the  Financial  AccountingStandards  Board's  ("FASB")Emerging  Issues Task Force  00-21,  ACCOUNTING  FORREVENUE  ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE  DELIVERABLES  ("EITF No. 00-21").  EITF No.00-21  applies to  certain  contractually  binding  arrangements  under  which acompany performs  multiple revenue  generating  activities and requires that allcompanies   account  for  each  element  within  an  arrangement  with  multipledeliverables as separate units of accounting if (a) the delivered item has valueon a stand-alone  basis,  (b) there is objective  and reliable  evidence of fairvalue and (c) the amount of the total  arrangement  consideration is fixed. EITFNo.  00-21 was  effective  for revenue  arrangements  entered  into in reportingperiods  beginning  after June 15, 2003 and was adopted by us effective  July 1,2003.      Our  revenue is  comprised  of  subscription,  capital  sale,  and servicecontract and transaction components, described as follows:      Subscription   revenue  contracts  are  primarily  with  brokerage  firms,international banks and global exchanges trading in equities and/or derivatives.Subscription  revenue contracts are for providing equipment and services and foruse of our NYFIX  Network,  with an initial term of generally one to three yearswith  automatic  renewal  periods  unless we  receive  prior  written  notice ofcancellation. Additional services, provided under schedules, or addendums to thecontract,  are either  co-terminus with the original contract or have provisionssimilar to the original contract.  Under the terms of the subscription contractsand addendums,  customers  typically  contract for a flat periodic  charge afterinitial  installation and acceptance.  The revenue related to these contracts isrecognized over the term of the contract, or addendum, on a straight-line basis.We also include within our  subscription  revenue,  telecommunication  and othercharges,  which we provide to the  customer at cost plus a normal  profit.  Suchrevenue is  recognized  as the services are  provided.  As we have no history ofsignificant cancellations, we do not record a reserve for cancellations.      Capital sale revenue, which is comprised of software and capital equipmentsales, is generated primarily by sales to customers in the futures,  options andcurrencies  trading market or to those customers who typically  acquire licensesin perpetuity,  and is recognized upon shipment of the product and acceptance bythe customer.  Capital sale revenue is  recognized in accordance  with SOP 97-2,described  above.  As we  have  no  history  of  significant  sales  returns  orallowances, we do not record a reserve for sales returns and allowances.      Service contract revenue,  which is comprised of maintenance contracts forsubscription  equipment and software and capital  equipment,  is recognized overthe contract period on a straight-line basis. Service contracts for subscriptionequipment are generally  co-terminus  with the  subscription  contract.  Servicecontracts  for  software and capital  equipment,  typically  characterized  as apercentage of the original  capital sale contract,  are generally for an initialterm of one to three  years with  automatic  renewal  periods  unless we receiveprior written notice of  cancellation.  Certain  service  contracts  provide forinvoicing in advance of the service being performed, generally quarterly.                                       34                                    NYFIX, INC.      Transaction  revenue  consists of per-share  fees charged to customers whosend and  receive  a match  and  execution  in our ATS  order  matching  system,customers to whom we provide  execution and smart order routing  technology  andgateways  to access  markets  in: (1) their own name,  (2) a third party give upname, or (3) our name.  Revenue on these contracts is generally invoiced monthlyin arrears or is extracted  from the clearing  process  within three days of thetrade  date  and  recognized  in the  period  in  which  it is  earned.  Certaintransaction  revenue contracts,  which include multiple  deliverables,  or othertypes of our revenue are accounted for in accordance with EITF 00-21,  describedabove.  Some of these contracts have minimum volume  commitments or are invoicedat a minimum  transaction-based fee. The arrangement  consideration is allocatedto each element based on the relative  fair values of each  element.  We accountfor each element of an arrangement with multiple deliverables separately. Vendorspecific objective  evidence for fair value of services is primarily  determinedby reference to renewal pricing.      Revenue on contracts  invoiced in advance of the services being  performedis deferred and  recognized as revenue over the period earned and is included in"deferred revenue" in our consolidated  balance sheets.  Shipping,  handling andinstallation  charges,  if any,  are  generally  invoiced to a customer  and areincluded in revenue upon completion of the installation.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS      We are required to estimate the  collectibility  of our trade  receivablesand a  considerable  amount of judgment is required in  assessing  the  ultimaterealization  of  receivables,  including the current  credit-worthiness  of eachcustomer.  We maintain  allowances  for doubtful  accounts for estimated  lossesresulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.  If thefinancial  condition  of our  customers  were to  deteriorate,  resulting  in animpairment  of their  ability to make  payments,  additional  allowances  may berequired.  The  collectibility  of accounts  receivable is evaluated  based on acombination  of  factors.  In  circumstances  where we are  aware of a  specificcustomer's  inability  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  (e.g.,  bankruptcyfilings),  a specific  reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due, toreduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will becollected.  For all other  customers,  we estimate a reserve for bad debts basedupon applying certain  percentages,  based on historical loss trends, to certainaccounts  receivable  aging  categories,  net of accounts  receivable  for whichrevenue  recognition has been deferred.  If circumstances  change (i.e.,  higherthan  expected  defaults or an  unexpected  material  adverse  change in a majorcustomer's  ability to meet its financial  obligations  to us), our estimates ofthe recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount.      In the fourth  quarter of 2003, a discussion  intensified  around  tradingrules and other issues at the NYSE.  NYSE  management  changes and proposed rulechanges at the exchange caused NYFIX management to become concerned with certaincustomer groups and certain individual  customers whose economic viability couldbecome challenged if such proposed rules were adopted. To increase our immediatecash position and to reduce our exposure to these  customers  going forward,  weinitiated  an  aggressive  program  to  accelerate  the  collection  of past dueaccounts  receivable  through,  among other things, the issuance of discounts tocertain  customers.  As a primary  result of this program,  we reduced  accountsreceivable  during the fourth  quarter of 2003 by $8.0  million  and  recorded aprovision  of $2.2  million  for  these  discounts  and  other  allowances.  Theallowance  for  doubtful  accounts was $1.8 million and $1.2 million at December31, 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  The provision for doubtful  accounts was $2.8million and $1.1 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT      Property and  equipment is stated at cost less  accumulated  depreciation.Depreciation  of property  and  equipment  is provided  using the  straight-linemethod  over its  estimated  useful  lives.  Changes  in  circumstances  such astechnological advances, changes to our business model or changes in the capital                                       35                                    NYFIX, INC.strategy  could  result  in the  actual  useful  lives  differing  from  initialestimates.  In those cases where we determine that the useful life of long-livedasset should be revised,  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of theestimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life.GOODWILL      Net assets of companies we acquired have been recorded at their fair valueat the date of acquisition.  Goodwill represents  acquisition costs in excess ofthe fair value of net assets  acquired and liabilities  assumed.  We adopted theFASB's Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 142, GOODWILLAND OTHER INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  effective  January 1, 2002. The provisions of SFASNo. 142 require that we allocate our  goodwill to our various  reporting  units,determine the carrying value of those businesses, and estimate the fair value ofthe  reporting  units  so  that  a  two-step  goodwill  impairment  test  can beperformed.  Our reporting units represent  components of our operating  segmentsand  are  the  same  as the  reportable  segments  identified  in Note 14 to theConsolidated Financial Statements.  In the first step of the goodwill impairmenttest, the fair value of each  reporting unit is compared to its carrying  value.If the fair value  exceeds the carrying  value,  goodwill is not impaired and nofurther testing is performed. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, thenthe second step must be  performed,  and the implied fair value of the reportingunit's  goodwill  must be determined  and compared to the carrying  value of thegoodwill for the  reporting  unit. If the carrying  value of a reporting  unit'sgoodwill  exceeds its implied fair value,  then an impairment  loss equal to thedifference is recorded.  In the absence of  circumstances  requiring  impairmenttesting on a  quarterly  or other more  frequent  basis,  our annual  impairmenttesting date is the beginning of our fourth quarter, which is October 1. For theyears ended  December 31, 2003 and 2002,  there was no  indication of impairmentfor either our Transaction  Services segment or our Technology Services segment,our two reporting units.  The present value of the discounted  future cash flowsof each segment  supported their carrying values as of October 1, 2003, the dateof our annual impairment analysis.  However, the excess of the discounted futurecash flows  above the  carrying  value of our  Technology  Services  segment wasmarginal  at that  date.  Our  projected  cash  flows  for 2004 and  beyond  aresufficient to support our Technology  Services segment goodwill  carrying value;however,  if we are not  profitable and do not have  sufficient  cash flows fromoperations in 2004 related to our Technology  Services  segment,  our TechnologyServices segment goodwill may become  partially or completely  impaired.  If ourgoodwill were to become impaired, the resulting write-down could have a materialimpact on our consolidated financial statements.PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT COSTS      Costs  incurred in the research,  design and  development  of software forsale to others as a separate  product or  embedded in a product and sold as partof the product as a whole are charged to expense until technological feasibilityis established.  Thereafter, software development costs, consisting primarily ofpayroll and related costs,  purchased  materials and services and software to beused within our  products,  which  significantly  enhance the  marketability  orsignificantly extend the life of our products are capitalized,  and amortized tocost of revenue on a  straight-line  basis over three years,  beginning when theproducts are offered for sale or when the  enhancements  are integrated into theproduct.  We are required to use  professional  judgment in determining  whetherproduct   enhancement   costs  meet  the  criteria  for  immediate   expense  orcapitalization,  in  accordance  with SFAS No. 86,  ACCOUNTING  FOR THE COSTS OFCOMPUTER  SOFTWARE  TO BE  SOLD,  LEASED,  OR  OTHERWISE  MARKETED.  We are alsorequired to use  professional  judgment in determining  whether the  unamortizedcapitalized  cost of each product  enhancement  approximates  the net realizablevalue of such products.                                       36                                    NYFIX, INC.LONG-LIVED ASSETS      We review the carrying value of long-lived assets,  including property andequipment,  intangible assets,  investments and other long-term amounts due fromunconsolidated   affiliates,  and  capitalized  product  enhancement  costs  forimpairment  whenever events or  circumstances  indicate that the carrying amountmay not be fully  recoverable.  If such an event or  circumstances  occurs,  therelated  estimated  fair value of the assets  would be compared to the  carryingamount,  and if needed, we would record an impairment to the extent by which thecarrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset.  We test intangible  assetswith  indefinite  lives annually for impairment  using a fair value  methodologysuch as discounted cash flows.  There was no impairment of our long-lived assetsrecorded for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.INCOME TAXES      We account for income taxes in  accordance  with SFAS No. 109,  ACCOUNTINGFOR  INCOME  TAXES,  which  requires  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets andliabilities  for the expected  future tax  consequences of events that have beenincluded in the  financial  statements or tax returns  using  presently  enactedincome tax rates. Our deferred tax assets were recorded to the extent we believethere will be sufficient  future taxable income to utilize those assets prior totheir  expiration.  To the extent we were unable to utilize deferred tax assets,we would  record a valuation  allowance  against the  unrealizable  amount,  andrecord a charge against operating results.  As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, novaluation allowance was required, as we believe it more likely than not that thedeferred tax assets will be realized.  Due to ever-changing  tax laws and incometax rates,  significant  judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rateexpected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future.We must also make  estimates  about the  sufficiency of taxable income in futureperiods  to offset  any  deductions  related to  deferred  tax assets  currentlyrecorded.  While we expect to be profitable and generate  taxable income in 2004to fully  utilize our deferred tax asset,  if we are not  profitable  and do notgenerate taxable income, we may not be able to support our assumption that it ismore likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and we may berequired to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. If ourlack of profitability and resulting valuation allowance were sufficiently large,the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.CONTINGENCIES      Contingencies  are  recorded as  liabilities  when it is  probable  that aliability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably  estimable.Disclosure is required when there is a reasonable  possibility that the ultimateloss will exceed the recorded provision.  We use outside counsel to assist us invarious  matters  including  regulations,   acquisitions,   trademark,   patent,personnel and other  matters.  We rely on the  professional  judgment of outsidecounsel  as well as our own  assessment  in  determining  whether  contingenciesshould be recorded.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION      We  account  for   stock-based   compensation   for  employees  under  therecognition  and  measurement  provisions  of the  Accounting  Principles  Board("APB")  Opinion No. 25,  ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES,  and relatedinterpretations and have elected the disclosure-only  alternative under SFAS No.123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION.

Cost of revenue  principally  consists of costs  associated  with our datacenters  where  we  maintain   equipment  and   infrastructure  to  support  ouroperations,  amortization of capitalized product enhancement costs, depreciationof subscription  equipment and other direct costs,  including  customer-specifictelecommunication costs, execution, clearing fees and market data feeds. Certaindata center costs, such as labor,  equipment  maintenance,  software support anddepreciation and amortization,  are allocated across our lines of business basedon usage estimates.      Operating  expense is  comprised  of selling,  general and  administrative("SG&A"),  research  and  development  ("R&D"),  equity in loss of NYFIXMillennium and  depreciation  and  amortization.  SG&A  expense  consists ofsalaries and  benefits,  office rent and other  office  expense,  provision  fordoubtful  accounts,  and  marketing  expense.   Corporate  SG&A  expense  isallocated  to our  segments  based on usage  estimates.  Equity in loss of NYFIXMillennium consists of 100% of NYFIX Millennium's  operating losses prior to ourexercising  the  Option  on  February  1,  2002,  which is when we  acquired  anadditional  30%  ownership  interest in NYFIX  Millennium,  resulting in our 80%ownership  interest  in  NYFIX  Millennium,  regained  control  of its  Board ofDirectors and consolidated its financial statements.  R&D expense relates toour cost of  developing  new products and  technologies  to meet the current andfuture needs of our customers, up to the point of technical feasibility at whichpoint we capitalize such costs to bring our products to market.  R&D expenseconsists  primarily  of  salaries  and  related  costs  for  our  technical  anddevelopment  staff.  Depreciation  and  amortization  expense  consists  of suchexpense for our corporate  equipment and software and  amortization  of acquiredintangible assets.                                       39                                    NYFIX, INC.      Certain  reclassifications have been made in the prior years' consolidatedfinancial  statements  to  conform  to  the  current  year's  presentation.   Inconnection   therewith,   amortization   expense  for   intangible   assets  wasreclassified to cost of revenue of $1.6 million for 2002.

Consolidated  revenue increased $10.1 million, or 18%, to $65.9 million in2003 as compared to $55.8 million in 2002.                                       40                                    NYFIX, INC.      Our Technology Services segment revenue increased $5.8 million, or 12%, to$54.2  million in 2003 as compared  to $48.4  million in 2002.  Our  traditionalequity products  subscription and service  contract  revenue  increased to $36.2million  in 2003 from $34.8  million in 2002.  This $1.4  million  increase  wasprimarily  attributable  to higher  average  revenue per  customer.  Our averageannual  revenue per customer  was  $136,000 in 2003,  as compared to $125,000 in2002. At December 31, 2003, we had 269 traditional equity customers, up from 262at the beginning of the year.  While we added 57 new  customers  during 2003, welost 50  customers,  equating to a 19% turnover  rate.  This turnover was mainlyattributable  to our  customers  ceasing  operations  and/or  merging with othercustomers.  In August 2002,  we began an initiative to sell circuits to buy-sideinstitutions  in order to  leverage  our NYFIX  Network in various  ways.  As ofDecember  31,  2003,  we had executed  agreements  with 80  customers  initiallyrequesting basic broker connectivity valued at approximately $6 million if fullyimplemented. In 2003, we recognized $1.3 million of revenue attributed to the 60buy-side  circuits  installed by the end of the year. In 2004, we expect revenuerelated  to our  buy-side  initiatives  to  increase  throughout  the  year.  Inaddition,  in 2003, revenues attributable to our Javelin products increased $1.9million,  to $9.7 million in 2003 from $7.8 million in 2002, as we had full yearJavelin  revenues  as  compared  to  nine  months  in 2002  as a  result  of ouracquisition  of Javelin at the end of the first quarter in 2002.  While we had anominal amount of revenue in 2003 from our Renaissance products, we believe thatwith our acquisition of Renaissance, we will be able to more effectively competefor customers who are  consolidating  their Nasdaq and listed  trading desks anddesire to migrate to one  platform.  In  addition,  we  believe we  continue  torealize the synergies as expected with our Javelin and Renaissance  acquisitionsand will  effectively  compete  for  customers  in 2004.  This  increase in 2003revenue for our Technology Services segment includes an increase of $2.4 millionfor  intercompany  revenues on  subscription  products  provided to  TransactionServices  segment  customers,  which  are  eliminated  in  consolidation.  As  apercentage of total revenue, our Technology Services segment decreased to 82% in2003 from 86% in 2002.      Our Transaction  Services segment revenue increased $6.7 million,  or 88%,to $14.3 million in 2003 as compared to $7.6 million in 2002. Our  broker-dealersubsidiaries,  NYFIX Transaction  Services and NYFIX Millennium operated for theentire year in 2003. NYFIX Transaction Services did not begin generating revenueuntil July 1, 2002 and we consolidated  NYFIX  Millennium upon acquisition of an80% ownership  interest in February 2002;  thus our  broker-dealer  subsidiariesgenerated  revenue  for six and  eleven  months,  respectively  in  2002.  NYFIXClearing  began  clearing  trades in November  2003,  and had only  intercompanyrevenue,  which had been eliminated in consolidation.  Our Transaction  Servicescustomer  base  doubled  during  2003  from 50 at  December  31,  2002 to 100 atDecember 2003,  averaging 77 for the year,  with average revenue per customer of$186,000 in 2003. This average  annualized  revenue per customer  decreased from$270,000  per  customer  in the first  quarter of 2003 to $150,000 in the fourthquarter of 2003.  The decrease in average  revenue per customer  during 2003 wasattributed  to a decrease in revenue from several large  customers  from whom wegenerate  revenue from DOT flow to the NYSE.  We compete with various  companiesthat  also  offer  certain  execution  services  that we  view as a  low-margin,"loss-leader"  services  to our  customers.  The  revenue  attributed  to  thesecustomers'  DOT flow was higher during the first half of 2003 than in the secondhalf of the year as a result of lowering rates to competitively keep and protectthe on-going business opportunity of any with such customers. In 2004, we expectto continue to add  customers  at a rate  similar to 2003 and expect our averagerevenue per customer to increase  from our fourth  quarter 2003 average due to atargeted  change in the customer  mix. As a  percentage  of total  revenue,  ourTransaction  Services  segment  increased  from 14% in 2002 to 22% in  2003.  Weexpect our Transaction Services segment revenue to be a larger percentage of ourconsolidated revenue in 2004 as compared to 2003.                                       41                                    NYFIX, INC.COST OF REVENUE      The following table presents an overview of our cost of revenue:                                                                Year Ended December 31,                                               -------------------------------------------------------                                                          2003                           2002                                                   $                 %            $                 %                                               ------------------------       ------------------------                                                                   ($ in thousands)Technology Services:  Subscription                                 $ 20,334             77%       $ 15,889             75%  Capital sale                                    3,066             12%          2,958             14%    Service contract                              2,859             11%          2,298             11%                                               --------                       --------  Sub-total                                      26,259             48%         21,145             44%                                               --------                       --------Transaction Services:  Subscription                                    1,541             14%            216              3%  Transaction                                     9,391             86%          7,095             97%                                               --------                       --------    Sub-total                                    10,932             76%          7,311             96%                                               --------                       --------Corporate and Eliminations:  Corporate:    Data center and telecommunications           18,662                         16,138    Fixed asset depreciation and amortization     5,413                          4,420    Amortization of product enhancement costs     2,657                          2,352  Allocated to:    Technology Services                         (22,108)                       (18,644)    Transaction Services                         (4,624)                        (4,266)                                               --------                       --------      Sub-total                                      --                             --                                               --------                       --------  Eliminations:    Subscription                                 (1,472)            n/a             --            n/a    Transaction                                  (1,118)            n/a           (150)           n/a                                               --------                       --------      Sub-total                                  (2,590)            n/a           (150)           n/a                                               --------                       --------Consolidated cost of revenue                   $ 34,601             52%       $ 28,306             51%                                               ========                       ========Segment subtotals are presented as a percentage of segment revenue.      Consolidated  cost of revenue  increased  $6.3  million,  or 22%, to $34.6million in 2003 as compared to $28.3  million in 2002.  The primary  factors forthe increase  were data center and  telecommunication  expense of $2.5  million,depreciation  expense of $1.0 million and product  enhancement cost amortizationof $0.3 million,  which was primarily due to an increase in  infrastructure  andcapacity  in our data  centers  and  product  enhancements  costs to support ourTechnology Services segment, including our derivatives,  Renaissance and Javelinproducts as we integrated them with our traditional equity products and onto ourNYFIX Network. In addition, cost of revenue increased by $1.0 million, which wasattributable  to  execution,   clearing  and  specialist  fees  related  to  ourTransaction  Services revenue, and by $0.7 million for acquired intangible assetamortization  due to a full year's expense in 2003 for the NYFIX  Millennium andJavelin  acquisitions  as compared to eleven  months and nine months  expense in2002,  respectively,  and  six  months  expense  in  2003  for  the  Renaissanceacquisition.  As a percentage of revenue,  cost of revenue increased slightly to52% in 2003, from 51% in 2002, as the increase in the aforementioned  TechnologyServices and  Transaction  Services costs offset the increase in our TransactionServices revenue as mentioned below.      Our Technology Services segment cost of revenue increased $5.1 million, or24%, to $26.3 million in 2003 as compared to $21.2 million in 2002. The increasewas primarily attributed to the aforementioned  increases in allocated corporateexpenses, such as data center and telecommunications expenses,  depreciation andamortization of fixed assets and amortization of product  enhancement  costs andamortization of acquired  intangible assets. In addition,  service contract costof revenue  increased $0.6 million,  or 24%, to $2.9 million for 2003, from $2.3million in 2002.  The increase  was  primarily  due to increased  labor costs tosupport our products.  As a percentage of revenue,  cost of revenue increased to48% in 2003, from 44% in 2002, as the increase in the aforementioned  costs grewfaster than revenue.  We expect to see a slight  decrease in our cost of revenueas a percentage  of revenue in 2004 as many of the  investments  in property andequipment  in our data center and network  infrastructure  made in 2002 and 2003should yield lower costs as a percentage of revenue.                                       42                                    NYFIX, INC.      Our Transaction  Services segment cost of revenue  increased $3.6 million,or 50%,  to $10.9  million  in 2003 as  compared  to $7.3  million  in 2002.  Inaddition to the aforementioned increase in transaction related expenses, cost ofrevenue  increased  related to  intercompany  charges  related to the TechnologyServices  revenue  passed  through to Transaction  Services  customers,  of $2.4million,  which  was  eliminated  in our  consolidated  cost  of  revenue.  As apercentage  of revenue,  cost of revenue  decreased to 76% in 2003,  from 96% in2002, as the increased  segment  revenue  absorbed  relatively  fixed costs.  Weexpect our cost of revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of TransactionServices segment revenue in 2004. This is attributable to the expected increasesin revenue and the change in  customer  mix as  described  above,  which  shouldenable us to spread our fixed  costs over a greater  revenue  base,  and reducedclearing  expenses  as a  result  of  self-clearing  our  trades  through  NYFIXClearing.GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN (AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE)      The  following  table  presents an overview of our gross  profit and grossprofit margin:                                                                Year Ended December 31,                                               -------------------------------------------------------                                                          2003                           2002                                                   $                 %            $                 %                                               ------------------------       ------------------------                                                                   ($ in thousands)Technology Services:  Subscription                                 $ 15,497             43%       $ 15,488             49%  Capital sale                                    5,889             66%          5,559             65%  Service contract                                6,511             69%          6,173             73%                                               --------                       --------    Sub-total                                    27,897             52%         27,220             56%                                               --------                       --------Transaction Services:  Subscription                                       70              4%            272             56%  Transaction                                     3,341             26%             14              0%                                               --------                       --------    Sub-total                                     3,411             24%            286              4%                                               --------                       --------Eliminations:  Subscription                                   (1,118)           n/a            (150)           n/a  Transaction                                     1,118            n/a             150            n/a                                               --------                       --------    Sub-total                                        --            n/a              --            n/a                                               --------                       --------Total gross profit:  Subscription                                   14,449             41%         15,610             49%  Capital sale                                    5,889             66%          5,559             65%  Service contract                                6,511             69%          6,173             73%  Transaction                                     4,459             35%            164              2%                                               --------                       --------    Consolidated gross profit                  $ 31,308             48%       $ 27,506             49%                                               ========                       ========Percentages  are  presented  as a  percentage  of  segment  revenue,  except forconsolidated  gross profit  percentages,  which are presented as a percentage ofconsolidated revenue.                                       43                                    NYFIX, INC.      Consolidated  gross profit increased $3.8 million to $31.3 million in 2003from $27.5 million in 2002. The aforementioned  increases in Technology Servicesand  Transaction  Services  cost of revenue  offset the  increases in TechnologyServices and Transaction Services revenue.  Accordingly, our gross profit margindecreased to 48% for 2003, as compared to 49% for 2002.      Our  Technology  Services  segment gross profit  increased $0.7 million to$27.9  million in 2003 from $27.2  million in 2002.  As a percentage  of segmentrevenue,  gross profit  margin  decreased  to 52% in 2003 from 56% in 2002.  Thedecrease  in  gross  profit  is  primarily  attributable  to the  aforementionedincreases  in our costs,  which grew  faster than  revenue as we were  generallyunable to pass  increased  costs to our  customers  due to  competitive  pricingpressures.  We expect to see slight  improvements  in our gross profit margin in2004, as many of the improvements to our data center and network  infrastructuremade in 2002 and 2003 should yield lower costs as a percentage of revenue.      Our Transaction  Services  segment gross profit  increased $3.1 million to$3.4  million in 2003 from $0.3  million  in 2002.  Transaction  Services  grossprofit  margin  increased  to 24% for 2003,  as  compared  to 4% for  2002.  Theincrease  in gross  profit  was  attributable  to the  increase  in  transactionrevenue, which grew at a higher rate than costs. As mentioned previously,  NYFIXTransaction  Services incurred costs for the entire year 2002, but did not startgenerating revenue until July 1, 2002. We expect our gross margin to continue toimprove as a percentage of Transaction Services segment revenue in 2004. This isattributable  to the  expected  increases  revenue and change in customer mix asdescribed above, which should enable us to spread our fixed costs over a greaterrevenue base, and reduced  clearing  expenses as a result of  self-clearing  ourtrades through NYFIX Clearing.SG&A      The following table presents an overview of our SG&A expense:                                                                Year Ended December 31,                                               -------------------------------------------------------                                                          2003                           2002                                                   $                 %            $                 %                                               ------------------------       ------------------------                                                                   ($ in thousands)Salaries and benefits                          $ 20,116             56%       $ 18,422             62%Provision for doubtful accounts                   2,831              8%          1,146              4%Occupancy and related                             2,753              8%          2,606              9%Marketing, travel and entertainment               2,573              7%          2,837              9%Professional fees                                 2,550              7%          2,032              7%General and other                                 4,940             14%          2,841              9%                                               --------                       --------  Total SG&A                               $ 35,763             54%       $ 29,884             54%                                               ========                       ========The total SG&A is presented as a percentage of consolidated revenue.      SG&A  expense  increased  $5.9  million,  or 20%, to $35.8 million for2003,  as  compared  to $29.9  million  for 2002.  The  increase  was  primarilyattributable to an increased  provision for doubtful accounts of $1.7 million asa result of our  recording of a provision of $2.2 million in the fourth  quarterof 2003 due  principally  to our  aforementioned  cash  collection  program.  Inaddition,  our salaries and benefits  increased  $1.7 million,  primarily due toincreased  staffing to support our  operations,  annual merit  increases for ourstaff and continuing increases to health care costs. We expect similar trends in2004. Our professional  fees increased $0.5 million in 2003 as compared to 2002,due primarily to non-audit  services in  connection  with the  requirements  setforth in the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of  2002,  in  addition  to  other  legal  andprofessional  services.  We expect  these costs to remain at a similar  level in2004.  Occupancy and related expenses  increased $0.1 million,  primarily due tothe Renaissance  acquisition.  General and other expense increased $2.1 million,which included increased general insurance expense of $0.4 million and a varietyof other items aggregating $1.7 million,  net. As a percentage of total revenue,SG&A expense remained  constant at 54% in 2003 and 2002, as SG&A expenseincreased at the same rate as revenue.                                       44                                    NYFIX, INC.      Subsequent  to December  31,  2003,  we entered into an agreement to leaseadditional  space  at our 100  Wall  Street  office.  In  connection  with  thisagreement,  we intend to cease use,  in the third  quarter  2004,  of one of ourother offices on Wall Street and  consolidate its operations into the new space.At that time, in accordance  with SFAS No. 146,  ACCOUNTING FOR EXIT OR DISPOSALACTIVITIES,  we expect to record a charge  to  operating  expense  of up to $3.0million,  subject to a lesser  amount to the extent we are able to sublease  thespace or negotiate an exit settlement  with the owner.  This charge includes theremaining  rent  payments,   net  of  estimated   sub-lease  income,  and  otherwrite-offs, including unamortized leasehold improvements.R&D      R&D expense remained  constant at $1.4 million for 2003 and 2002. As apercentage of total revenue,  research and development  expense  decreased to 2%for 2003 from 3% for the  2002,  due to the  increase  in  revenue.  We expect asimilar amount of R&D expense in 2004.EQUITY IN LOSS OF NYFIX MILLENNIUM      Effective  February  1, 2002,  we  exercised  the Option to  increase  ourownership  interest  in  NYFIX  Millennium,  from  50% to 80% and at  that  dateconsolidated NYFIX Millennium's financial statements.  NYFIX Millennium incurredoperating  losses  of $1.3  million  for the  month of  January  2002,  which werecognized under the equity method.DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION      Depreciation and amortization  expense decreased $0.6 million,  or 19%, to$2.7  million for 2003,  from $3.3  million for 2002,  due  primarily to reduceddepreciation expense due to reduced levels of leased equipment.  As a percentageof total revenue, depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 4% for 2003from 6% for 2002. The decrease as a percentage of total revenue was attributableto a combination of reduced  depreciation and amortization expense and increasedrevenue.LOSS FROM OPERATIONS      Loss from  operations  increased $0.1 million,  or 1%, to $8.5 million for2003, from $8.4 million for 2002. The increased loss was primarily due to highercost of revenue  and  operating  expense  offset by the  increase  in revenue asdescribed above. In addition,  our 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by theequity in loss of NYFIX  Millennium  of $1.3  million.  As a percentage of totalrevenue, loss from operations was a deficit of 13% in 2003 and 15% in 2002.INVESTMENT INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET      Investment  income  remained  constant at $0.6  million for 2003 and 2002.This  was  principally  due  to  lower  interest  income  due to  lower  averageinvestment  balances and lower yields,  which was offset by additional  gains onsales of short-term  investments.  We expect similar trends in investment incomein 2004.  Interest expense  decreased $0.1 million,  or 52%, to $0.1 million for2003, from $0.2 million for 2002, principally due to reduced interest on capital                                       45                                    NYFIX, INC.lease  obligations as the principal  balances on such leases  declined.  We alsoincurred a nominal  amount of interest for notes issued in  connection  with ourRenaissance  acquisition,  which we expect will be the largest component of thiscategory in 2004.  Other  expense,  net,  which  primarily  included  our equityinterest in our  previously  unconsolidated  affiliates,  Renaissance  (which weacquired in July 2003) and EuroLink,  increased $0.2 million to $0.8 million for2003,  from $0.6  million for 2002,  due  primarily  to our equity in the lossesincurred by these  entities.  We recognized our equity in the losses of EuroLinkof $0.4  million  in 2003,  compared  to  losses  of $0.5  million  in 2002.  Werecognized our equity in the losses of Renaissance through June 30, 2003 of $0.4million.  We made our initial investment in Renaissance in the fourth quarter of2002, and recognized our equity in its losses of $0.1 million in that period. Weaccounted for Renaissance by the equity method through June 30, 2003.  EffectiveJuly  1,  2003,  we  acquired  the  remaining  82% of the  membership  units  inRenaissance  that we did not already own, and  accordingly,  we consolidated theresults of operations of  Renaissance  as of that date. We agreed to acquire theremaining  60% of  EuroLink  on March  29,  2004,  and we will be  consolidatingEurolink's  operating results effective as of that date. We expect that EuroLinkwill  improve its  operating  results in 2004,  thereby  reducing  the amount oflosses included in our consolidated financial statements.INCOME TAX BENEFIT      We recorded an income tax benefit of $4.4 million for 2003, compared to anincome tax benefit of $3.6 million for 2002.  The income tax benefit in 2003 wasattributable  to a tax  benefit  on our  pre-tax  loss of $8.7  million  and taxbenefits  relating to certain Federal and state R&D tax credits  aggregating$0.6 million. Our effective tax benefit rate of 50% in 2003 exceeded the Federalstatutory  rate  primarily  due to the  effect of the  aforementioned  state andFederal tax benefits and research and  development  tax credits.  The income taxbenefit  in 2002 was  attributable  to a tax  benefit  on our  pre-tax  loss andrecognition of certain  Federal R&D tax credits,  aggregating  $0.9 million,from prior  years.  We will receive no income tax benefit for the equity in lossof NYFIX  Millennium of $1.3 million in 2002 as the operating  loss is allocatedto the Initial Partners and New Partners for income tax purposes.  Our effectivetax benefit rate of 41% for 2002 exceeded the Federal  statutory  rate primarilydue to the  impact of the  aforementioned  R&D  tax  credits of 9% and stateincome  taxes of 5%. This benefit was offset by the impact of the equity in lossof NYFIX  Millennium  of 8%. We expect  to return to  profitability  in 2004 andexpect our  effective  tax rate to be slightly  below 40%,  which  includes  thestatutory Federal and state rates and is offset by certain R&D tax credits.                                       46                                    NYFIX, INC.YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001REVENUE      The following table presents an overview of our revenue:                                                                Year Ended December 31,                                               -------------------------------------------------------                                                          2002                           2001                                                   $                 %            $                 %                                               ------------------------       ------------------------                                                                   ($ in thousands)Technology Services:  Subscription                                 $ 31,377             65%       $ 28,955             70%  Capital sale                                    8,517             18%          8,123             20%  Service contract                                8,471             17%          4,319             10%                                               --------                       --------    Sub-total                                    48,365             86%         41,397            100%                                               --------                       --------Transaction Services:  Subscription                                      488              6%             --            n/a  Transaction                                     7,109             94%             --            n/a                                               --------                       --------    Sub-total                                     7,597             14%             --            n/a                                               --------                       --------Eliminations:  Subscription                                     (150)           n/a              --            n/a                                               --------                       --------    Sub-total                                      (150)           n/a              --            n/a                                               --------                       --------Total revenue  Subscription                                   31,715             57%         28,955             70%  Capital sale                                    8,517             15%          8,123             20%  Service contract                                8,471             15%          4,319             10%  Transaction                                     7,109             13%             --            n/a                                               --------                       --------    Consolidated revenue                       $ 55,812            100%       $ 41,397            100%                                               ========                       ========Segment subtotals are presented as a percentage of consolidated revenue.      Consolidated revenue increased $14.4 million, or 35%, to $55.8 million for2002, from $41.4 million for 2001,  primarily due to revenue attributable to ourJavelin  business,   transaction  revenue   attributable  to  our  broker-dealersubsidiaries,  and  increased  subscription  and service  contract  revenue fromincreased demand from our existing  customers and the addition of new customers.These amounts were  slightly  offset by lower  revenue  attributable  to capitalsales of software and hardware.      Our Technology Services segment revenue increased $7.0 million, or 17%, to$48.4  million in 2002 as compared  to $41.4  million in 2001.  Our  traditionalequity products subscription and service contract revenue increased $1.5 millionto $34.8  million in 2002 from $33.3  million in 2001.  Subscription  revenue inthis segment  increased  $2.4 million,  or 8%, to $31.4  million for 2002,  from$29.0 million for 2001,  primarily due to subscription  revenue  attributable toour  Javelin  businesses  of $1.4  million,  and the  increased  demand from ourexisting  customers and the net addition of new customers of $1.0 million.  As apercentage of consolidated  revenue,  subscription  revenue  decreased to 57% in2002 from 70% in 2001,  primarily due to the addition of transaction  revenue in2002 and the  increase  of  service  contract  revenue of $3.6  million  for ourJavelin products.  Without transaction revenue,  subscription revenue would havebeen 65% of consolidated  revenue.  Capital sale revenue increased $0.4 million,or 5%, to $8.5  million  for 2002,  from $8.1  million  for 2001.  Capital  salerevenue  increased  $2.8  million due to our Javelin  business.  This amount wassignificantly offset by lower capital sale revenue for our core products of $2.4million,  principally  due to our continued  effort to convert  customers to oursubscription-based model. As a percentage of consolidated revenue, sales revenuedecreased to 15% in 2002,  from 20% in 2001,  partially due to the effect of theaddition of  transaction  revenue and the general  slower growth of capital salerevenue compared with our other revenue components during 2002. Service contractrevenue  increased  $4.2  million,  or 98%, to $8.5 million for 2002,  from $4.3million in 2001. The increase was primarily due to service  contract  revenue ofour Javelin business of $3.6 million,  and an increase in subscription  contractrevenue for our core products of $0.6 million.  As a percentage of  consolidatedrevenue,  service  contract revenue was 15% in 2002, as compared to 10% in 2001,primarily due to the  aforementioned  service  contract  revenue for our Javelinbusiness,  offset in part by the effect of the addition of  transaction  revenueduring 2002.                                       47                                    NYFIX, INC.

The  increase  was  primarily  due to theSG&A  expense for our NYFIX  Millennium and Javelin  businesses and start-upexpenses related to NYFIX Transaction  Services of $13.2 million,  and increasedcosts of corporate departments to support a larger organization of $4.5 million,which reflects increased  salaries,  commissions and related benefit costs, rentexpense,  and various office expenses due to an increase in personnel to supportour growth and acquisitions.  As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A expenseincreased to 54% in 2002 from 30% in 2001. The increase as a percentage of totalrevenue  was  attributable  to  increased  expense  to  support  our  growth andacquisitions.R&D      R&D expense  increased to $1.4 million for 2002, from $0.5 million for2001,  primarily as a result of our  continuing  efforts to develop new productsand services. As a percentage of total revenue, research and development expensewas 2% for 2002 as compared to 1% for 2001.EQUITY IN LOSS OF NYFIX MILLENNIUM      Effective  February  1, 2002,  we  exercised  the Option to  increase  ourownership  interest  in  NYFIX  Millennium,  from  50% to 80% and at  that  dateconsolidated NYFIX Millennium's financial statements.  NYFIX Millennium incurredoperating  losses  of $1.3  million  for the  month of  January  2002,  which werecognized  under the equity  method.  This  compares to $11.6  million of NYFIXMillennium losses for 2001 which we recognized under the equity method.DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION      Depreciation and amortization  expense increased $1.9 million, or 133%, to$3.3 million for 2002,  from $1.4 million for 2001.  This increase was primarilyattributable to the continued investment in our infrastructure, and to                                       51                                    NYFIX, INC.administrative  support  equipment  and  leasehold  improvements  to support ourgrowth, of $1.1 million, and depreciation and amortization expense for our NYFIXMillennium  and Javelin  businesses  of $0.8  million.  As a percentage of totalrevenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 6% for 2002 as compared to 3%for 2001.  The increase in percentage of revenue was primarily  attributable  tothe impact of the aforementioned costs.LOSS FROM OPERATIONS      Loss from operations changed by $10.0 million,  or 625%, to a loss of $8.4million for 2002,  as compared to income  from  operations  of $1.6  million for2001.  The decline in  operating  results was  primarily  due to the increase inoperating  expenses  due to the  acquisition  of Javelin and  start-up  expensesrelated  to  NYFIX  Transaction  Services,  and  increased  costs  of  corporatedepartments to support a larger organization.  As a percentage of total revenue,loss from  operations  was a deficit of 15% in 2002 as  compared  to income fromoperations  of 4% in 2001.  The  decline as a  percentage  of total  revenue wasattributable  to a  higher  growth  in  costs of our  acquired  businesses  thanrevenue.INVESTMENT INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET      Investment  income decreased  slightly to $0.6 million for 2002, from $0.7million for 2001, principally due to the combination of lower average investmentbalances   coupled  with  lower  yields  on  cash   equivalents  and  short-terminvestments in 2002 as compared to 2001.  Interest expense decreased $81,000, or24% to $262,000 for 2002,  from  $343,000 for 2001,  principally  as a result ofdecreased  interest  expense  on loans  due to the  payoff of our line of creditduring  July  2001  of  $118,000  and  lower  interest  paid  on  capital  leaseobligations of $33,000.  Slightly offsetting these amounts was interest incurredin  connection  with late  payments of certain  obligations,  of $70,000.  Otherexpense  increased  $607,000  to  $621,000  for  2002,  from  $14,000  for 2001,principally as a result of losses  recognized  from our equity  ownership in ourpreviously  unconsolidated  affiliates  of $474,000 for EuroLink and of $138,000for Renaissance in 2002.INCOME TAX (BENEFIT) PROVISION      We recorded an income tax benefit of $3.6 million for 2002,  compared to aprovision for income taxes of $5.4 million for 2001.  The income tax benefit wasattributable  to our pre-tax loss in 2002 and certain Federal and state researchand  development  tax  credits  of $0.9  million,  available  for  research  anddevelopment expenses incurred during 1999 to 2002. We will receive no income taxbenefit for the equity in loss of NYFIX  Millennium  of $1.3 million in 2002 and$11.6  million in 2001 as these  operating  losses are  allocated to the InitialPartners and New Partners for income tax  purposes.  Our  effective  tax benefitrate of 41% in 2002 exceeds the Federal  statutory benefit rate primarily due tothe impact of the aforementioned  research and development tax credits of 9% andstate income taxes of 5%. This benefit was offset by the impact of the equity inloss of NYFIX Millennium of 8%. Our effective tax provision rate of 276% in 2001was higher than the combined Federal  statutory income tax rate primarily due toimpact of the equity in loss of NYFIX  Millennium of 206% and that impact on ourstate income taxes of 34%.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Historically,  a  significant  source of our  funding has been the sale ofequity  securities.  Between  1997 and 1999 we raised a total of $9.5 million innet proceeds through several private  placements where we issued an aggregate of3,431,000  shares of our common stock. In 2001, we raised $57.3 million,  net ofexpenses, from a follow-on public offering of three million shares of our commonstock. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the follow-on  public offeringto  repurchase  1.3 million  shares of our common stock at an aggregate  cost of$19.1 million.  We also have historically  received funding from the exercise ofstock  options by  employees,  which  aggregated  $3.6 million from 2001 through2003.  NYFIX Inc.  funded its  acquisitions  of Javelin,  NYFIX  Millennium  andRenaissance  primarily through the issuance of NYFIX Inc. stock. Please see Item1. Business - Acquisitions and Investments.                                       52                                    NYFIX, INC.      Another  significant  source  of  funding  for us is cash  generated  fromoperations,  which was $15.4  million,  $3.7 million and $10.6  million in 2003,2002 and 2001, respectively,  aggregating to $29.7 million. Excluding changes inassets and liabilities,  net of business acquisitions,  which tend to be subjectto  short-term  fluctuations,  the  comparable  amount  of cash  generated  fromoperations  was $8.5 million,  $7.4 million,  and $16.3  million,  respectively,aggregating  $32.2 million.  Our primary source of cash from  operations is fromrevenue  received from our  customers.  Our primary uses of cash for  operationsinclude data center  expenses,  including its operations  and  telecommunicationcosts,  and operating  expenses,  including  salaries and  benefits,  marketing,travel and entertainment,  office rent and related occupancy,  and other generaland administrative expenses.      We have invested $5.3 million, $4.6 million and $7.1 million in 2003, 2002and  2001,   respectively,   aggregating  $17.0  million,  in  our  data  centerinfrastructure  and other property and equipment to keep current with technologytrends. We expect to invest at a similar level in 2004 as compared to 2003.      We have capitalized product enhancements of $5.3 million, $2.8 million and$2.7  million,  in  2003,  2002 and  2001,  respectively,  to keep our  productscompetitive. The increase in capitalized product enhancement costs, in 2003, wasprimarily  attributable  to our Javelin and  Renaissance  product lines. We havemany projects in development, as described in Item 1, which we expect to releaseinto production  during 2004. We hope to capitalize a comparable  amount to 2003for product enhancements in 2004.      We have invested $2.5 million,  $12.1 million and $17.2 million of cash in2003,  2002  and  2001,   respectively,   aggregating   $31.8  million  for  ouraforementioned acquisitions of Javelin, Renaissance,  NYFIX Millennium and NYFIXTransaction  Services  and  our  investment  in  EuroLink.  In  regards  to  ourRenaissance acquisition,  we have issued outstanding notes payable over the nextseveral years,  aggregating $3.0 million,  which are payable,  at our option, incash or our common stock. In April 2004,  pursuant to notice from certain payeesafter  default on the notes,  we issued shares of our common stock in payment of$2.0 million of such notes.  Certain contingent  liabilities remain with respectto such notes that could require cash payments up to $0.8 million.  We intend topay the remaining debt with our common stock,  thus not requiring cash. On March29,  2004,  we  executed a binding  agreement  to acquire the  remaining  60% ofEuroLink's common stock that we did not own. The transaction closed on April 28,2004. We financed the transaction with $24,000 in cash and notes payable of $0.5million.  We intend to  integrate  EuroLink  with NYFIX  International,  our newLondon-based  subsidiary through which we plan to capture order flow to and fromthe United States and within Europe.  To date, we have allocated $0.9 million tothis endeavor and do not expect to invest a significant additional amount withinthe next twelve months. We have no current plans for any other acquisitions.  Weplan to focus on the synergies arising from our previous acquisitions.      Our long-term capital needs depend on numerous factors, including the rateat which we obtain new  customers  and expand our staff and  infrastructure,  asneeded, to accommodate such growth, and the rate at which we choose to invest innew technologies to modify our NYFIX Network and infrastructure. We have ongoingneeds  for  capital,  including  working  capital  for  operations  and  capitalexpenditures to maintain and expand our operations.      At December 31, 2003, our principal  sources of liquidity were cash,  cashequivalents  and  short-term  investments  in the aggregate of $24.4 million andaccounts  receivable  of $10.4  million.  At December 31,  2003,  we had currentaccounts  payable and accrued  expenses  aggregating  $13.2  million.  We do notexpect to make any significant  income tax payments in 2004 due to available netoperating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits.                                       53                                    NYFIX, INC.      NYFIX  Clearing,  NYFIX  Transaction  Services  and NYFIX  Millennium,  asregistered  broker-dealers,  are subject to the minimum net capital requirementsof the NASD. These broker-dealers have consistently  operated in excess of theserequirements.  At December 31, 2003, NYFIX Clearing,  NYFIX Transaction Servicesand NYFIX  Millennium  net  capital  was $10.5  million,  $2.6  million and $1.2million,  respectively,  exceeding the minimum  required by $10.3 million,  $2.5million and $1.0 million, respectively.  During 2003, we funded $10.8 million toour  broker-dealer  subsidiary,  NYFIX  Clearing,  to enable it to maintain  itsminimum  excess net capital  requirement  of $10.0 million as a condition of itsapproval by the DTCC. At December 31, 2003, we had an aggregate of $14.0 millionof our consolidated cash,  cash-equivalents and short-term investments committedto maintain our three broker-dealer subsidiaries' minimum and minimum excess netcapital requirements of $10.6 million.  Our broker-dealer  subsidiaries may needus to fund  or  commit  more  of our  consolidated  cash,  cash-equivalents  andshort-term  investments in the future to maintain their  individual  minimum andminimum excess net capital  requirements.  If any or all of these  broker-dealersubsidiaries  were to fall below  their  minimum or minimum  excess net  capitalrequirements, their operations may be restricted by certain regulatory agencies.      We believe that we achieve  greater  synergies by integrating  the productofferings  of Javelin  and  Renaissance  with our  existing  product  offerings.Although  our  broker-dealer  businesses  have  incurred  losses  through  theirdevelopment  and start-up  stages,  we believe  that  revenue  will  continue toincrease as we gain greater  acceptance  of our product  offerings.  Although weprovided  our  unconsolidated  affiliate,  EuroLink,  with only $0.6  million incumulative  funding,  it may need  additional  working  capital funding until itgenerates positive cash flow, and is exploring sources of funding, including us.      We believe that our cash and  short-term  investments  of $24.4 million atDecember  31,  2003,  together  with  anticipated  cash  to  be  generated  fromoperations,  will be sufficient to support our capital and operating  needs, ournet capital requirements of our broker-dealer operations and the operating needsof EuroLink for at least the next twelve months.  However,  we may obtain creditfacilities to provide  incremental  availability  of working  capital to furthersupport our operating and investment strategy.      The following  summarizes  our material  commitments at December 31, 2003,and the effect such  obligations  are expected to have on our liquidity and cashflows in future periods:                                                         Payments due by periodContractual Obligations         Total      Less than 1 year     1-3 years        3-5 years     More than 5 years                               -------     ----------------     ---------        ---------     -----------------                                                              (in thousands)Long-term debt                 $ 2,743          $ 1,684          $   706          $   353          $    --Capital lease obligations          666              531              135               --               --Operating leases                15,945            4,196            5,738            4,625            1,386Purchase obligations             6,324            3,691            2,633               --               --                               -------          -------          -------          -------          -------  Total                        $25,678          $10,102          $ 9,212          $ 4,978          $ 1,386                               =======          =======          =======          =======          =======      Long-term  debt  consists  of  payments  on  promissory  notes  issued  inconnection with the Renaissance  acquisition.  As described  earlier,  under theterms of the notes issued,  we may elect to make the note payments in our commonstock instead of cash, which would reduce the amounts shown above and lessen theeffect on liquidity and cash flows.  Operating leases assumptions do not includethe impact of executing a lease to acquire additional office space at one of ourWall Street offices.  As described in Item 2.  Properties,  we expect this leasewill,  within the next year,  reduce our space by  consolidating  our offices onWall Street into one  building and vacating  our other  offices.  Regardless  ofwhether we are successful in sub-leasing our space,  the new lease will not havea significant  effect on our liquidity in the next twelve months.  Should we notbe able to sub-lease our space, we plan to vacate, and the resulting  additionallease payments will have an impact on our working capital.  Purchase obligationsinclude minimum purchase obligations to certain  telecommunication  providers inexchange for pricing discounts.                                       54                                    NYFIX, INC.WORKING CAPITAL      At December 31, 2003, we had working  capital of $23.3 million as comparedto $30.8  million at December  31,  2002.  The  decrease in working  capital wasprincipally  due to the cash used to acquire  property  and  equipment,  enhanceproducts, fund loans and advances to unconsolidated  affiliates and the additionof current liabilities in connection with our acquisition of Renaissance.  Theseamounts were partially offset by cash flows provided by operating activities.CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES      Net cash provided by operating  activities in 2003 was $15.4  million,  asour net loss of $4.4 million, adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation,amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts and equity in lossof unconsolidated  affiliates,  provided $9.6 million. Favorable working capitalchanges of $5.8  million  included a decrease  in  accounts  receivable  of $3.4million  and an  increase in  accounts  payable  and other  liabilities  of $3.3million and were partially offset by an increase in prepaid and other assets. In2004,  we expect to  continue  to generate  positive  cash flows from  operatingactivities.      Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was $3.7 million, as ournet loss of $5.0 million,  adjusted for non-cash  items,  such as  depreciation,amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, equity in loss ofunconsolidated   affiliates  and  minority   interest   provided  $7.2  million.Unfavorable  working  capital  changes  offset by other  changes,  net of assetsacquired  and  liabilities   assumed  from  our  NYFIX  Millennium  and  Javelinacquisitions, decreased cash by $3.5 million.CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES      Net cash  used in  investing  activities  in 2003 was $5.8  million.  Thisconsisted  primarily  of  capital   expenditures  for  property  and  equipment,principally  for data center  equipment and software,  of $5.3 million,  productenhancement  costs and other  assets of $5.3  million and loans and  advances tounconsolidated  affiliates of $2.4 million.  These amounts were partially offsetby proceeds from the net sales of  short-term  investments  of $7.3 million.  In2004, we expect to invest a similar amount of cash for capital  expenditures forproperty  and  equipment  as well as  product  enhancement  costs.  We expect tocontinue  to fund  EuroLink  for the  foreseeable  future,  but  expect the 2004funding to be less than $1.0  million.  On March 15, 2004, a  representative  offormer  shareholders  of Javelin  executed a settlement  agreement  with us thatprovided us with $1.3 million of cash primarily as a return of funds  previouslyheld in escrow from our  acquisition of Javelin,  which we received by March 31,2004.      Net cash provided by investing  activities in 2002 was $3.2 million.  Thisconsisted primarily of proceeds from the net sales of short-term  investments of$22.4  million and proceeds  from  capital  sale of  equipment of $0.4  million,offset by payments for our NYFIX  Millennium  and Javelin  acquisitions,  net ofcash   acquired,   of  $6.8  million,   investments   in  and  net  advances  tounconsolidated affiliates of $5.4 million, capital expenditures, mostly for datacenter equipment and software, of $4.6 million and product enhancement costs andother assets of $2.8 million.CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES      Net cash  provided  by  financing  activities  in 2003  was $0.2  million,consisting primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting                                       55                                    NYFIX, INC.from the exercise of stock  options by employees of $0.8 million and  repaymentsof notes receivable issued for common stock of $0.5 million, partially offset bypayments  under  capital  lease  obligations  of $1.1  million.  We have nominalcapital lease obligations remaining as of December 31, 2003.      Net cash used in financing activities in 2002 was $0.7 million, consistingprimarily of principal payments under capital lease obligations of $1.2 million,offset by net proceeds  from the exercise of stock  options by employees of $0.4million  and  repayments  of notes  receivable  issued for common  stock of $0.1million.SEASONALITY AND INFLATION      We believe that our  operations  have not been  significantly  affected byseasonality or inflation.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS      We  have  no  material  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  other  than,  asdescribed  above,  operating  leases that are  discussed  in Note 6 and purchaseobligations  that  are  discussed  in  Note  7  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation  ("FIN") 46, CONSOLIDATIONOF VARIABLE  INTEREST  ENTITIES,  which  requires the  consolidation  of certainentities  considered to be variable  interest  entities  ("VIEs").  An entity isconsidered  to  be  a  VIE  when  it  has  equity   investors   which  lack  thecharacteristics  of  a  controlling   financial  interest,  or  its  capital  isinsufficient  to  permit  it  to  finance  its  activities   without  additionalsubordinated  financial  support.  Consolidation  of a  VIE  by an  investor  isrequired when it is  determined  that the investor will absorb a majority of theVIE's expected losses or residual returns if they occur. FIN 46 provides certainexceptions to these rules, including qualifying special purpose entities subjectto the  requirements of SFAS No. 140,  ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OFFINANCIAL ASSETS AND EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES.  VIEs created after January31, 2003 must be consolidated  immediately.  In December,  2003, the FASB issuedFIN 46  (revised)  ("FIN  46R"),  CONSOLIDATION  OF VARIABLE  ENTITIES.  FIN 46Rclarified  some of the  provisions of FIN 46 and deferred the effective  date ofimplementation  for certain  entities.  Under the guidance of FIN 46R,  entitiesthat do not have  interests  in  structures  that are  commonly  referred  to asspecial  purpose  entities  ("SPEs") are required to apply the provisions of FIN46R in financial  statements  for periods  ending after March 15, 2004, for VIEsthat  existed  prior to February 1, 2003.  We do not have  interests in SPEs andwill  apply the  provisions  of FIN 46R with our first  quarter  2004  financialstatements.  We do not expect the  adoption  of FIN 46R to have an effect on ourconsolidated financial statements.      In May  2003,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS No.  150,  ACCOUNTING  FOR  CERTAINFINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  WITH  CHARACTERISTICS  OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITIES.SFAS No. 150  establishes  standards for how an issuer  classifies  and measurescertain  financial  instruments  with  characteristics  of both  liabilities andequities.  It requires that an issuer  classify a financial  instrument  that iswithin its scope as a  liability  (or an asset in some  circumstances).  Many ofthose  instruments  were  previously  classified  as  equity.  SFAS  No.  150 iseffective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003.The  adoption  of SFAS  No.  150 did not  have  an  effect  on our  consolidatedfinancial statements.                                       56                                    NYFIX, INC.RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESSSOME OF OUR  SUBSIDIARIES  HAVE NOT BEEN  PROFITABLE AND THEREFORE WE MAY NOT BEPROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE.      In December  2001,  we acquired an inactive  broker-dealer  and renamed itNYFIX  Transaction  Services,   Inc.  In  May  2002,  the  NASD  approved  NYFIXTransaction  Services'  membership  application and it first started  generatingrevenues as of July 1, 2002.  Through its first two years of  operations,  NYFIXTransaction  Services  incurred a net loss of $2.2 million and required  capitalcontributions of $5.1 million.  Although we expect NYFIX Transaction Services tostart to generate  positive cash flows during 2004, we can provide no assurancesthat it will do so.  Accordingly,  NYFIX  Transaction  Services  may  need us tocontinue  to provide the  necessary  capital to  maintain  its  minimum  capitalrequirements, thus impacting our working capital.      Effective as of February 1, 2002, we increased  our ownership  interest inNYFIX  Millennium from 50% to 80%. NYFIX Millennium was formed in September 1999and since that time has incurred aggregate net operating losses of $31.2 millionthrough  December 31, 2003.  Although NYFIX Millennium  generated  positive cashflows during 2003, we can provide no assurances  that it will continue to do so.Accordingly,  NYFIX  Millennium may need us to provide the necessary  capital tomaintain its capital requirements, thus impacting our working capital.      Effective as of March 31, 2002, we acquired Javelin.  Javelin incurred netlosses of $1.8  million,  $6.7  million and $2.0  million for the years 2000 and2001 and the three months ended March 31, 2002,  respectively.  Although Javelinresults are not reported separately, Javelin continued to incur net losses untilthe fourth  quarter of 2002.  We believe  that our  synergies  with Javelin willenhance our overall operating results, but there is no assurance that it will doso. Our strategy to apply our  subscription-based  model to Javelin's  products,where  feasible,   may  not  be  successful.   Javelin's   business  is  heavilyconcentrated   towards  capital  sales,   which  are  very   unpredictable   andinconsistent.  Transitioning Javelin to more of a subscription-based model couldhave an adverse impact on our working capital.      Effective as of July 1, 2003, we acquired the remaining 82% of Renaissancethat  we did  not  previously  own.  Since  its  inception  in  September  2002,Renaissance  incurred  net  losses of $1.6  million  for the four  months  endedDecember  31,  2002 and $2.2  million  for the six months  ended June 30,  2003.Although Renaissance results are not reported separately,  Renaissance continuedto incur  operating  losses  for the  remainder  of 2003.  We  believe  that oursynergies  with  Renaissance  and the ability to sell our products  into the OTCmarket will  enhance our overall  operating  results,  but there is no assurancethat it will do so.      In 2003, we formed NYFIX Clearing,  which commenced operations in November2003  following  approval  by the DTCC to operate as a  clearing  firm.  ThroughDecember 2003,  NYFIX Clearing  incurred a net loss of $0.4 million and requiredcapital  contributions  of $10.8  million.  Although we expect cost savings fromusing NYFIX Clearing to clear our transaction  business  trades,  NYFIX Clearingmay need us to continue to provide the necessary capital to maintain its minimumcapital requirements, thus impacting our working capital.      If we are not  profitable in 2004 or beyond,  we may be required to recordan impairment  charge relating to our goodwill or a valuation  allowance againstour deferred  tax assets.  If the  impairment  charge and  valuation  allowance,either alone or together, are sufficiently large, the impact on our consolidatedfinancial statements could be material.A NUMBER OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES  HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING  HISTORY,  WHICH MAKES ITDIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THEIR PROSPECTS.  THEIR FUTURE  FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE MAYDISAPPOINT SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS AND RESULT IN A DECLINE IN OUR STOCKPRICE.      Renaissance was formed in September 2002. NYFIX Clearing, NYFIX Millenniumand Javelin were formed in February  2003,  September  1999 and  November  1997,respectively.  Also, we purchased NYFIX  Transaction  Services in December 2001.Because  of  their  limited  operating  history,  these  entities  have  limitedfinancial data that can be used to evaluate their businesses. Consideration mustbe given to their prospects in light of the risks,  expenses,  delays,  problemsand difficulties  frequently  encountered in the establishment of a new businessin an emerging and rapidly evolving industry. Renaissance, NYFIX Clearing, NYFIXMillennium,  Javelin and NYFIX  Transaction  Services may not be  successful  intheir businesses, and profitability may never be attained or sustained.                                       57                                    NYFIX, INC.EUROLINK MAY NEED  ADDITIONAL  FUNDING FROM US, THUS HAVING AN ADVERSE IMPACT ONOUR LIQUIDITY.      We have  provided  funding  to  EuroLink,  our  previously  unconsolidatedaffiliate and recently acquired  wholly-owned  subsidiary in 2004.  EuroLink mayneed additional funds from us, until it generates  positive cash flow or obtainsother sources of capital.  We cannot provide  assurance that additional  interimfunding, if necessary, will not have an adverse impact on our liquidity.A  SIGNIFICANT  POWER  OR  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  FAILURE  COULD  CAUSE  US AND OURCUSTOMERS TO LOSE REVENUE AND SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY FOR CUSTOMER LOSSES.      Our services depend on our ability to store, retrieve,  process and managesignificant  databases and to  electronically  receive and process trade orders.Our  systems  and data  centers  could fail due to power  failures,  caused by avariety  of  factors,   or  outages,   caused  by  high  demand  placed  on  theinfrastructures  of the  utilities we use in New York City and  elsewhere in theNortheast  portion  of  the  United  States.  Due  to the  complexity  of  theseelectrical  systems,  errors or failures could occur which render an entire siteto be unusable.      We  constantly  monitor  system  loads and  performances  and as necessaryupgrade our systems to handle estimated increases in power consumption. However,we may not be able to accurately  predict future demand.  To mitigate the impactof power failures,  we maintain  critical data center facilities at two separatelocations in the Northeast  portion of the United  States.  Although  these datacenters are  serviced  by the same  utility,  they are  serviced  via  differentsub-stations.  In the event of a power outage at any of our data centers, we useuninterruptible  power supplies  ("UPS") to provide  limited  battery backup forcritical systems. We also use diesel-powered generators to backup the UPSs.      In the event of loss of power or telecommunications  services at either ofthese locations,  we believe there are sufficient  backup facilities in place togive us the  necessary  time to access,  or switch over to, our  redundant  datacenter.  It is  possible  that  multiple  telecommunications  vendors  could  beimpacted so severely that the  multi-vendor  and  multi-site  strategy would notinsure communications services to our customers.      Since it is fairly common for multiple carriers to share the same physicalinfrastructure  such  as  Central  Offices,  telephone  poles  and  below-groundconduit,  instances like major cable cuts or regional  natural  disasters  couldadversely impact our customers and us.WE  RELY  ON  MULTIPLE   TELECOMMUNICATIONS  CARRIERS  FOR  DATA  DELIVERY.  ANYDISRUPTIONS  TO THESE  SERVICES  COULD  HAVE A  MATERIAL  ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OURBUSINESS.      We utilize  network  services from five major carriers:  AT&T,  Qwest,Sprint,  MCI and  Verizon.  Customers  are given the choice of using one or morenetwork  carriers to provide network  services to their location.  A majority ofNYFIX customers utilize a dual carrier solution.      Our relationship with each of these carriers is that of a vendor providingus services.  We currently  do not provide any services to these  carriers.  Thecontracts with these carriers have commitment  terms that range from two to fiveyears.  We  receive  discounts  based on certain  term and  volume  commitments.Currently,  where  applicable,  we are  exceeding any required  monthly  minimumbilling amounts.      Our use of five major carriers has multiple benefits:      o     Diversity  of  telecommunication  infrastructure  between  the major            carriers                                       58                                    NYFIX, INC.      o     A  competitive  environment  to help insure  aggressive  pricing for            network services      o     The  ability to  completely  migrate  circuits  from one  carrier to            another  due to  non-competitive  pricing  or a  carrier  no  longer            providing adequate services.      If a major carrier were to shut down its network without advance  warning,it would take at least 45 days to replace the circuits of that vendor with thoseof another  vendor.  If we moved from one  carrier to  another,  we would  incursubstantial  expenses because of the need to use two carriers for some period oftime.  Exclusivity  agreements  between  carriers and  connecting  points on thenetwork  could also impact us. For example,  MCI is the sole provider of networkservices  for  NASDAQ.  If MCI  discontinued  operations,  we would  incur coststransitioning to a new NASDAQ network service provider.The time  needed to  transfer  circuits  from one  carrier to  another  would beapproximately four to six weeks. During the transfer, we would incur overlappingcircuit charges with each carrier for a minimum of thirty days. We would need tohave the new circuits in place before  requesting that the original  circuits bedisconnected, and we would have to provide 30 days prior notice for the circuitsto be disconnected. Therefore, the minimum cost for us to move our business fromone  carrier to another  would be at least one month of charges  from the formercarrier.WE ARE SUBJECT TO HUMAN ERROR IN OUR OPERATIONS,  WHICH COULD CAUSE A DISRUPTIONIN OUR SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND CORRUPT OUR DATA.      Our  services  depend  on  our  operations  staff  to  manage  significantdatabases,  systems, applications and processes that receive and process orders.An outage of our systems and service  could happen as a result of human error inour operational  procedures.  We believe we have  experienced  personnel whom weregularly send for refresher training to hone their skills, we maintain databasebackups and roll back procedures in case a human error is made and we have otherpolicies,  processes and procedures in place that collectively help us to reducethe  possibility  and  consequences  of human  error.  However we can provide noassurance  that  human  error  will not cause a  significant  disruption  to oursystems or service.ANY  INFILTRATION  OF  HARMFUL  VIRUSES  COULD  CAUSE  US TO LOSE  REVENUES  ANDCUSTOMERS AND SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY FOR CUSTOMER LOSSES.      Potential  sources of a virus that could affect us include  connections tocustomer  systems,  emails  received  by us or  connectivity  to  the  Internet.Although to date, we have not had any incidence of a virus fully penetrating ourprotective layers and infiltrating our production systems, we continue to reviewour  protective  layers and  safeguards  as our systems are  susceptible  to thegrowing number of potential viruses.      We utilize  multiple  methods to combat  viruses.  The first  method is toprevent  viruses from entering our NYFIX Network.  This is done by placing rigidrestrictions on our NYFIX Network,  called access  controls lists ("ACL").  ACLsare used where  customers  or vendors  connect  to our NYFIX  Network.  A secondmethod of  preventing  viruses  from  entering  our NYFIX  Network is the use offirewalls.  A firewall  typically guards an internal  network against  maliciousaccess from the outside;  however,  firewalls  may also be  configured  to limitaccess to the outside from internal  users.  In spite of the ACLs and firewalls,it may still be possible for viruses to enter our NYFIX Network.      If a virus is still  able to  penetrate  our  NYFIX  Network,  we  utilizecentrally managed anti-virus scanning software on servers and workstations.  Ouranti-virus  software actively scans servers and workstations on the network.  Inspite of the active  anti-virus  scanning,  it is possible for a virus not to bedetected.      As an additional method to combat viruses,  we utilize intrusion detectionsoftware ("IDS").  IDS servers and software are located at key points around thenetwork and monitor systems for malicious activity.                                       59                                    NYFIX, INC.WE RELY, IN PART,  ON OTHERS TO SUPPLY THE  MATERIALS  AND SUPPLIES,  UNDERLYINGSOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS WE USE TO PROVIDE OUR SERVICES.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAINTHIRD PARTY SUPPORT AND DELIVERY ON A TIMELY AND RELIABLE BASIS,  OUR ABILITY TOPERFORM  SERVICES  COULD BE  HINDERED  AND THE  RELATIONSHIPS  WE HAVE  WITH OURCUSTOMERS COULD BE HARMED.      Our  manufactured  products  are based on standard PC  components  readilyavailable  in  the  consumer  market  place.  All  electronic,  computer-relatedcomponents  that  we  use in our  products  are  not  manufacturer  or  supplierspecific.  We can substitute  components  from a diverse group of  manufacturerswith no assembly or delivery delays to our customers.      However,  our manufactured  products contain several custom parts specificto our design.  These parts are limited to sheet metal  enclosures  and internalwiring.  We own the  designs  for  these  components  and can  source  them frommultiple  vendors  in our  immediate  area  or  throughout  the  United  States.Currently we maintain  relationships with a minimum of two alternate vendors forcabling and sheet metal,  either of which can deliver components within standarddelivery  cycles.  For  both of these  components  we use  vendors  such as CTC,Advantage   Sheet  Metal  and   Interface   Technology.   Although  we  maintainrelationships  with numerous  vendors for our manufactured  products,  if we areunable to obtain  third  party  delivery  and  support on a timely and  reliablebasis, our ability to provide our product and services could be hindered.      We rely on a number of third  parties to supply  software and systems,  aswell as equipment and related maintenance.  Our systems are built using a numberof commonly used  technologies.  As an example,  we use systems from IBM,  H.P.,EMC, Sun Micro Systems,  Oracle, Sybase, Veritas and Microsoft. Our products aresubject to potential  defects in these third party  components.  Although we (aswell as the individual  vendors)  exercise  strict testing and  verification  ofsystems and software, defects can cause disruptions of customer service. We haveinvested in various test systems to make sure supplier's components work as wellas our developed software.      Since we depend on third parties to supply us with underlying software andsystems on a  reliable,  timely  basis,  we  maintain  service  and  maintenanceagreements  with all our main vendors.  We have standard  service  agreements atdifferent  levels,  depending  on how  critical  the  vendor's  system is to theoperation of our business.  For most systems we have a high level of redundancy,which gives us less time  critical  dependency on a particular  vendor.  We havewarranty or maintenance agreements with all above-mentioned  vendors. Because ofthe diversity in vendors, there is no dependence on a single vendor. However, ifwe are  unable to obtain  third  party  support  and  delivery  on a timely  andreliable  basis,  our  ability to perform  services  could be  hindered  and therelationships we have with our customers could be harmed.WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED  NUMBER OF NETWORK  EQUIPMENT  SUPPLIERS  AND DO NOT HAVESUPPLY  CONTRACTS.  OUR  INABILITY  TO OBTAIN  NECESSARY  NETWORK  EQUIPMENT  ORTECHNICAL SUPPORT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.      Some key  components  we use in our  networks  are  available  only from alimited  number of suppliers.  We do not have  long-term  supply  contracts withthese  or any  other  limited  source  vendors,  and we  purchase  data  networkequipment  on a purchase  order  basis.  If we are  unable to obtain  sufficientquantities of limited source  equipment and required  technical  support,  or todevelop  alternate  sources as  required  in the  future,  our ability to deployequipment  in our networks  could be delayed or reduced,  or we may be forced topay higher prices for our network  components.  Delays or reductions in suppliescould lead to slowdowns or failures of our networks.OUR RELIANCE ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES PROVIDERS EXPOSESUS TO A NUMBER OF RISKS  OVER  WHICH WE HAVE NO  CONTROL,  INCLUDING  RISKS WITHRESPECT TO INCREASED PRICES AND TERMINATION OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES.                                       60                                    NYFIX, INC.      The operation of our networks  depends upon the capacity,  reliability andsecurity of services  provided  to us by a limited  number of  telecommunicationservices  providers.  We  have  no  control  over  the  operation,   quality  ormaintenance of those services or whether the vendors will improve their servicesor continue to provide services that are essential to our business. In addition,telecommunication  services  providers  may  increase  the  prices at which theyprovide  services,  which  would  increase  our  costs.  If one or  more  of ourtelecommunication services providers were to cease to provide essential servicesor to  significantly  increase  their  prices,  we  could  be  required  to findalternative  vendors for these  services.  With a limited number of vendors,  wecould experience  significant  delays in obtaining new or replacement  services,which could lead to slowdowns or failures of our  networks.  This could harm ourreputation and could cause us to lose customers and revenues.      A slowdown or failure of our networks could cause us to lose customers andrevenue.      Our business is based upon our ability to rapidly and reliably receive andtransmit data through our networks.  One or more of our networks could slow downsignificantly or fail for a variety of reasons, including:      o     undetected  defects or errors in our software  programs,  especially            when first integrated into a network,      o     unexpected   problems    encountered   when   integrating   changes,            enhancements  or upgrades of third party  equipment or software with            our systems,      o     computer viruses,      o     natural or man-made disasters disrupting power or telecommunications            systems generally, and      o     damage  to,  or  failure  of,  our  systems  due to  human  error or            intentional disruption.      We may not have sufficient redundant systems or backup  telecommunicationsfacilities to allow us to receive and transmit data in the event of  significantsystem  failures.  Any significant  degradation or failure of one or more of ournetworks could cause our customers to suffer delays in  transaction  processing,which could damage our  reputation,  increase our service costs,  or cause us tolose customers and revenues.OUR PRODUCTS MAY SUFFER FROM DEFECTS OR ERRORS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR REPUTATION ORSUBJECT US TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS.      The products we offer are inherently complex.  Despite testing and qualitycontrol,  current  versions,  new versions or  enhancements  of our products maycontain  errors.  Any errors,  slowdown or failure in our  products may harm ourreputation  or subject us to product  liability  claims.  Significant  technicalchallenges  also arise with our  products  because our  customers  purchase  andintegrate them with a number of third party computer  applications and software.Such  integration  may not always be successful.  Any defects or errors that arediscovered after commercial release could result in the loss of revenue or delayin market acceptance of our products. Moreover, we could face higher developmentcosts  if our  products  contain  undetected  errors,  or if we fail to meet ourcustomers'  expectations.  Although  we  maintain  general  liability  insurancecoverage,  this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms orat all. In addition, a product liability claim, whether or not successful, couldharm our business by increasing our costs and distracting our management.WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL  COMPETITION IN OUR INDIVIDUAL  PRODUCT AREAS FROM COMPANIESTHAT HAVE LARGER AND GREATER  FINANCIAL,  TECHNICAL AND MARKETING  CAPABILITIES.THIS COULD MAKE IT MORE  DIFFICULT  FOR US TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN  MARKET SHARE ANDMAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY.                                       61                                    NYFIX, INC.      We  operate in a highly  competitive  market  and  expect  competition  tointensify in the future.  Certain of our  competitors,  including  the financialexchanges,  may have significantly  greater  financial,  technical and marketingresources and more extensive customer bases and knowledge of the industry.      Our industry is constantly  evolving through  technological and regulatorychange. Our competition varies widely and we encounter  different  categories ofcompetitors  for  each of our  product  and  service  offerings.  We  also  facecompetition from customers who choose to maintain their own  infrastructure  anddevelop their own in-house proprietary order management software systems.IF WE DO NOT COMPETE  EFFECTIVELY,  WE MAY LOSE MARKET SHARE TO COMPETITORS  ANDSUFFER A DECLINE IN REVENUES.      Many of our competitors have greater financial,  technical,  marketing andother resources than us. As a result,  they may be able to support lower pricingand margins and to devote greater  resources to marketing  their current and newproducts and services.WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND OUR CUSTOMERS' TECHNOLOGYNEEDS.      We face rapidly changing  technology and frequent new service offerings bycompetitors  that can render existing  services  obsolete or  unmarketable.  Ourfuture  success  depends  on our  ability to enhance  existing  services  and todevelop,  introduce  and  market,  on a timely  and cost  effective  basis,  newservices   that  keep  pace  with   technological   developments   and  customerrequirements.OUR CUSTOMERS MAY DEVELOP IN-HOUSE  NETWORKS OR USE NETWORK PROVIDERS OTHER THANNYFIX AND DIVERT PART OR ALL OF THEIR DATA  COMMUNICATIONS  FROM OUR NETWORKS TOTHEIR NETWORKS.      Our customers may develop in-house networks or use other network providersbecause such  customers  want to connect to  destinations  not part of our NYFIXNetwork  or to only  certain,  but not all,  destinations  covered  by our NYFIXNetwork.  As a result of any of these events, we could experience lower revenuesor lost  revenues  from  delays in  connecting  customers  to our NYFIX  Networkindirectly through third party providers rather than directly by us.WE FACE SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON THE PRICES FOR OUR SERVICES FROM OUR COMPETITORSAND  CUSTOMERS.  OUR  FAILURE TO SUSTAIN  PRICING  COULD  IMPAIR OUR  ABILITY TOACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY OR POSITIVE CASH FLOW.      Our  competitors and customers may cause us to reduce the prices we chargefor  services,  the effects of which we may not be able to offset by  increasingthe number of customers or transactions. The primary sources of pricing pressureinclude:      o     Competitors offering our customers services at reduced prices.      o     Our customers seeking greater pricing discounts.      o     Consolidation of existing customers.A DECLINE IN SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE, OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE, OR TRANSACTIONREVENUE WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.      Subscription   revenue  is  our  most   significant   source  of  revenue.Subscription  revenue is fixed based on a contractual period of time,  typicallyone to three years,  and is not affected by trading  volumes.  However,  tradingvolumes do affect the  revenues of our  customers  and this could  affect  theirfuture  purchases of our  technology  and  services.  Pricing  pressures  due tocompetition, failure to sign new agreements with customers because of reductionsin their new technology  spending,  and observed  consolidation in the financialsector could affect our revenues and  profitability.  Our costs  associated withsupporting the  subscription  agreements are generally  fixed and thus a loss ofrevenue would impact profitability.                                       62                                    NYFIX, INC.      Transaction revenue has been a growing component of our revenue;  however,there is no assurance we can continue to grow transaction  revenue. As our coststo support  transaction  revenue are generally fixed, a decline in revenue woulddirectly impact our profitability. Several risk factors apply to the analysis ofthe potential growth of transaction revenue.      There is significant competitive pressure brought on by a proliferation ofelectronic  execution  competitors.  There is the  potential  for  change in thecurrent  United  States  market  structure  that may make it  difficult  for thetransaction  business to compete with more  traditional  broker-dealer  businessmodels.  For example,  the NYSE could establish limits on electronic  access, orthe NYSE could create an electronic matching order engine of its own.Customer  demands for  increased  bandwidth  and speed  could place  significantstress on our infrastructure  requiring  continued  reinvestment in hardware andsoftware to keep pace with overall business growth.  We have no current plans totransition  from the  subscription  or  transaction-based  revenue  model due togeneral  acceptance of it in the marketplace and the current trend of recurring,predictable revenue recognition and cash flows.NYSE AND SEC SPECIFIC REGULATORY CHANGES MAY IMPAIR OUR REVENUE.      We provide our floor broker technology services to major NYSE member firmsand a large group of $2 brokers.  The NYSE is proposing to update the securitiestrading  rules  related to the DOT  system  services  of NYSE  Direct + and NYSEInstitutional  Express.  Both of these services are electronic  trade  executionservices  that NYSE has  created to  compete,  mainly  with ECNs and other fullyelectronic marketplaces.      If the extended functionality and access to either one or both NYSE Direct+ and NYSE Institutional Express are successful,  this may lead to a lesser needto  utilize  floor  brokers  and  clerks to  execute  trades  on the NYSE.  Thissituation would proportionally reduce the need for floor booth technology.  Thissituation is a risk to the NYFIX  subscription  revenue  that is generated  fromexisting  operations.  This situation also is a risk to estimating future growthin the subscription revenue from floor booth technology provided by NYFIX.      We would be most  impacted if the NYSE proposed  changes  happen in a verysudden  timeframe  and create an  immediate  consolidation  of large NYSE memberfirms and  independent  member firms. We are aware that both types of firms havebeen  operating  under  sustained  financial  pressure due to market  conditionsduring  2001 to present.  We  anticipate  that many member  firms both large andsmall could become insolvent within months if the given changes do make the NYSEmore  electronically  accessible  and reduce  order flow to the floor  brokeragegroups.WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT  OUR  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  RIGHTS,  WHICH COULDWEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND INCREASE OUR COSTS.      Our success and ability to compete are dependent to a  significant  degreeon our intellectual  property rights, which include our proprietary  technology,trade secrets and customer base. However, no one patent, trademark or other formof intellectual property rights is critical to our business.      Despite  our  efforts  to protect  our  proprietary  rights,  unauthorizedparties  may  attempt  to copy or  otherwise  obtain  and  use our  products  ortechnology.  Monitoring  unauthorized  use of our products is  difficult  and wecannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent  unauthorized use ofour technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protectour proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. If competitors are ableto use our  technology,  our  ability  to compete  effectively  could be harmed.Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our  intellectual  propertyrights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of theproprietary  rights of others,  or to defend against claims of  infringement  orinvalidity.  Litigation,  whether or not successful, could result in substantialcosts and diversions of resources.                                       63                                    NYFIX, INC.WE MAY FACE CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY  RIGHTS,  WHICH COULD HARM OURBUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.      Third parties may assert claims that we are infringing  their  proprietaryrights.  If  infringement  claims  are  asserted  against  us,  we  could  incursignificant  costs in defending those claims.  We may be required to discontinueusing and selling any infringing technology and services, to expend resources todevelop  non-infringing  technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties forother technology.  We may be unable to acquire licenses for the other technologyon reasonable  commercial terms or at all. As a result,  we may find that we areunable to continue to offer the services  and  products  upon which our businessdepends.THE SECURITIES BROKERAGE INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.IF NYFIX MILLENNIUM, NYFIX TRANSACTION SERVICES OR NYFIX CLEARING FAIL TO COMPLYWITH THESE  REGULATIONS,  THEY MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY OR OTHER ACTION BYREGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS.      We are subject to extensive  government  regulation  and may be subject todisciplinary  or other action by regulatory  organizations  if we fail to complywith such regulation, which could increase our capital expenditures and decreaseour earnings.      NYFIX  Millennium,  NYFIX  Transaction  Services  and NYFIX  Clearing  aresubject to extensive  regulation  under both Federal and state laws. In additionto these laws, we must comply with rules of the SEC,  including  Regulation  ATSfor NYFIX Millennium,  and the NASD,  various stock exchanges,  state securitiescommissions and other regulatory  bodies charged with safeguarding the integrityof the  securities  markets  and other  financial  markets  and  protecting  theinterests  of  investors   participating   in  these   markets.   As  registeredbroker-dealers,  NYFIX Millennium, NYFIX Transaction Services and NYFIX Clearingare subject to numerous regulations covering the securities business, including:      o     marketing practices;      o     capital structure, including net capital requirements;      o     record keeping; and      o     conduct of directors, officers and employees.      Any  failure  to  comply  with  these   regulations  could  subject  NYFIXMillennium,  NYFIX Transaction Services or NYFIX Clearing to censure, fines, theissuance of cease-and-desist  orders or the suspension,  and/or disqualificationof its officers,  directors or employees.  The fines, if material, could have anadverse  effect on our earnings  because it could  greatly  increase our capitalexpenditures.  If any of our employees were suspended or disqualified, we may beunable to meet the needs of our customers or to solicit new business. This couldalso have an adverse  effect on our earnings.  Furthermore,  any such  penaltiescould  materially  harm our  reputation  in the  industry,  which  could  have along-term effect on our financial growth.NYFIX MILLENNIUM'S,  NYFIX TRANSACTION  SERVICES' OR NYFIX CLEARING'S COMPLIANCEAND RISK MANAGEMENT METHODS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.      NYFIX  Millennium's,  NYFIX  Transaction  Services'  and NYFIX  Clearing'sability to comply with  regulations  depends  largely on the  establishment  andmaintenance  of an  effective  compliance  system,  as well as their  ability toattract and retain  qualified  compliance  personnel.  NYFIX  Millennium,  NYFIXTransaction Services or NYFIX Clearing could be subject to disciplinary or otheractions due to claimed noncompliance with regulations in the future. If a claim                                       64                                    NYFIX, INC.of  noncompliance  is  made  by a  regulatory  authority,  the  efforts  of  themanagement of NYFIX  Millennium,  NYFIX  Transaction  Services or NYFIX Clearingcould be  diverted  to  responding  to such claim and they could be subject to arange of possible  consequences,  including the payment of fines, civil lawsuitsand the suspension of one or more portions of its business.  In addition,  theirmode of operation and profitability may be directly affected by:      o     additional legislation;      o     changes  in rules  promulgated  by the SEC,  the NASD,  the Board of            Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the various stock exchanges            or other self-regulatory organizations; or      o     changes in the  interpretation  or  enforcement of existing laws and            rules.      In addition,  NYFIX Millennium's  status as a recognized ATS requires thatits trade  execution  and  communication  systems be able to handle  anticipatedpresent and future peak trading volumes.  If any of our systems become disabled,the  ability  to  process  trades  and  handle  peak  trading  volumes  will  becompromised. The status of NYFIX Millennium and NYFIX Clearing Corporation as anSEC registered broker-dealers and NASD members is conditioned, in part, on theirability to process and settle trades.OUR  BROKER-DEALERS  SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE RESTRICTED IN THEIR  OPERATIONS  SHOULDTHEY FAIL TO MEET THEIR MINIMUM AND MINIMUM EXCESS NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.      Our NYFIX  Millennium,  NYFIX  Transaction  Services  and  NYFIX  Clearingbroker-dealer subsidiaries,  individually,  have to maintain certain minimum netcapital  and  minimum  excess net  capital  requirements  as mandated by certainregulatory   agencies.   Some  of  these  requirements  vary  according  to  theprofitability of the broker-dealer and rise as profitability  falls. At December31,  2003,  our  broker-dealers  in the  aggregate  had  minimum net capital andminimum  excess net capital  requirements  of $10.6 million.  Our  broker-dealeroperations may need additional funds in the future to maintain their minimum andminimum excess net capital  requirements.  At December 31, 2003, we had cash andshort-term   investments   of  $9.7   million  that  were  not  subject  to  ourbroker-dealer  minimum net capital and minimum excess net capital  requirements.If our  broker-dealers  fall below their minimum and minimum  excess net capitalrequirements,   their   operations  would  be  restricted  by  their  respectiveregulatory agencies.OUR  BROKER-DEALER  SUBSIDIARIES ARE AT RISK IF THEIR CUSTOMERS DEFAULT ON THEIRTRADING OBLIGATIONS.      Under applicable regulatory requirements,  our broker-dealers are requiredto cover  for  their  customers  if their  customers  default  on their  tradingobligations by improperly failing to deliver cash or securities on the date whena trade  settles.  The  broker-dealer  can  pursue its  customer  for losses thebroker-dealer  sustains by  delivering  the  required  cash or  securities.  Ourbroker-dealers  attempt to manage the risks  associated  with  customer  tradingdefaults  by  conducting  a number  of  background  checks  on their  customers,including   financial  history,   credit,   regulatory  and  legal  checks.  Thebroker-dealer  decides  which  background  checks  to  undertake  based  on  therelationship  with the customer  and the nature and extent of the business  thatthe customer has with the broker-dealer. In addition, our broker-dealers monitortrades to check that  counterparties  know and confirm trades before  settlementdate to minimize market risk to which our  broker-dealers can be exposed betweentrade date and settlement date. Despite these measures to reduce the risk to ourbroker-dealers  from  trading  defaults  by  their  customers,  there  can be noassurance  that our  broker-dealers  will avoid such risks  entirely  or that iflosses do occur they will not have a material impact on the financial  conditionor reputation of the affected broker-dealer.NYFIX  CLEARING MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CLEAR TRADES DUE TO MAXIMUM LIMITS IMPOSED BYTHE DTCC AND THE NEED FOR INTRA-DAY FUNDING COMMITMENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES.      NYFIX  Clearing is  restricted  to a maximum limit imposed by the DTCC. Inaddition,  to be  able  to  clear  trades,  NYFIX  Clearing  may  require  addedcommitments from  unaffiliated  institutions to provide funding during a tradingday ("intra-day  funding").  An inability to maintain or raise its maximum limitor to obtain and maintain  third-party  commitments to support intra-day fundingcould have an adverse impact on NYFIX  Clearing's  ability to maintain or expandits business.                                       65                                    NYFIX, INC.THE  ABILITY OF NYFIX  CLEARING  TO  MAINTAIN  OR EXPAND ITS  BUSINESS  COULD BEADVERSELY  IMPACTED IF IT DID NOT  CONTINUE TO HAVE  THIRD-PARTY  ASSISTANCE  TOACCESS EXCHANGES AND OTHER IMPORTANT TRADING VENUES.      NYFIX  Clearing  provides  clearing  and  settlement   services  with  theassistance of third parties who provide NYFIX  Clearing  access to exchanges andother important trading venues in the execution business. If such third parties,exchanges or regulators  determine  that NYFIX  Clearing must  discontinue  suchindirect access,  this could have an adverse impact on NYFIX Clearing's  abilityto maintain or expand its business.WE MAY LACK THE  CAPITAL  REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN  OUR  COMPETITIVE  POSITION OR TOSUSTAIN OUR GROWTH.      We have historically relied on cash flow from operations and proceeds fromequity and debt to fund our operations,  capital expenditures and expansion.  Ifwe are  unable to  obtain  sufficient  capital  in the  future,  we may face thefollowing risks:      o     We may not be able to continue to meet  customer  demand for service            quality, availability and competitive pricing.      o     We may not be able to expand or to acquire complementary businesses.      o     We may not be able to develop new services or  otherwise  respond to            changing business conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures.WE MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO MEET DEMANDS RESULTING FROM GROWTH.      Growth may strain our  management  systems and  resources.  We may need tomake additional investments in the following areas:      o     recruitment and training,      o     communications and information systems,      o     sales and marketing,      o     facilities and other infrastructure,      o     treasury and accounting functions,      o     licensing and acquisition of technology and rights, and      o     employee and customer relations and management.      If we fail to develop  systems,  procedures and controls to handle currentand future growth on a timely basis,  we may be less efficient in the managementof our business or encounter difficulties  implementing our strategy,  either ofwhich could harm our results of operations.CONDUCTING  BUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL  MARKETS SUBJECTS US TO ADDITIONAL  RISKS.ALSO, OUR STRATEGY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS  INTERNATIONALLY  MAY FAIL,  WHICH MAYIMPEDE OUR GROWTH AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS.      For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,  approximately  10%,7% and 15%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from our international                                       66                                    NYFIX, INC.operations.  We believe international revenue will be an important component forour future  success.  Thus, we are subject to various risks in doing business ininternational markets, including:      o     difficulties  in  recruiting,  training and retaining  personnel and            managing and implementing existing and new international operations;      o     localizing our products to target the specific needs and preferences            of foreign customers, which may differ from our traditional customer            base in the United States,      o     building our brand name and awareness of our services  among foreign            customers;      o     competition  with existing market  participants  which have a longer            history  in and  greater  familiarity  with the  foreign  markets we            enter;      o     laws and business practices that can favor local competitors;      o     fluctuations in currency exchange rates;      o     imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign  currencies  into            United States  dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments            by foreign subsidiaries; and      o     changes in a specific  country's  or region's  political or economic            conditions.      If we fail adequately to address the challenges and risks  associated withour  international  operations  and  expansion,  we may  encounter  difficultiesimplementing  our strategy,  which could impede our growth or harm our operatingresults.OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES  AND GROW OUR BUSINESS  COULD BESIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF KEY PERSONNEL.      Our business is highly  dependent on a number of key  executive  officers,including Peter K. Hansen,  our founder,  Chief Executive Officer and President,and Lars Kragh, our Chief Information  Officer,  who have been with us since ourinception in 1991.  The loss of the services of any of our key  personnel  couldhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.RECENTLY  ENACTED AND PROPOSED CHANGES IN SECURITIES LAWS ARE LIKELY TO INCREASEOUR COSTS.      The  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002,  as  well  as new  rules  subsequentlyimplemented by the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  has required changes insome of our corporate  governance and  accounting  practices.  In addition,  theNASDAQ has promulgated a number of regulations.  We expect these laws, rules andregulations  to increase our legal and  financial  compliance  costs and to makesome activities more difficult,  time consuming and costly. We also expect thesenew rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us toobtain  director  and  officer  liability  insurance,  and we may be required toaccept reduced coverage or incur significantly  higher costs to obtain coverage.These new laws,  rules and regulations  could also make it more difficult for usto attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors,  particularlyto serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.TERRORIST  THREATS AND ATTACKS AND THE IRAQI SITUATION HAVE CREATED  SIGNIFICANTINSTABILITY  AND  UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL  MARKETPLACE TO WHICH WE SELL ANDMAY CREATE A MORE VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT.      The  terrorist  attacks in the United  States on September  11, 2001,  thedeclaration  of war by the  United  States  against  terrorism  and the  currentsituation in Iraq have created  significant  instability  and uncertainty in thefinancial  marketplace,  both in the United  States and  globally.  Such adversepolitical events may have a continued negative impact on economic  conditions inthe financial marketplace and our customers. The unfavorable conditions may havean adverse effect on our financial operations including, but not limited to, ourability  to  expand  the  market  for  our   products,   enter  into   strategicrelationships and effectively compete.                                       67                                    NYFIX, INC.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKINTEREST RATES      Market risk generally  represents the risk of loss that may be expected toresult from the potential change in value of a financial  instrument as a resultof fluctuations in credit ratings of the issuer,  equity prices,  interest ratesor  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  We  do  not  use  derivative  financialinstruments for any purpose.      We are  exposed to market  risk  principally  through  changes in interestrates and equity prices. Our short-term investment portfolio of $3.4 million and$10.7  million at December  31, 2003 and 2002,  respectively,  consisted of $2.4million and $6.8 million,  respectively,  of auction rate  certificates and $3.9million of mutual fund securities at December 31, 2002. We also had $1.0 millionof treasury  bills at December  31,  2003.  Risk is limited on the auction  ratecertificates  portfolio due to the fact that it is invested in insured municipalbonds.  The potential  decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical  10%change in interest rates for the auction rate certificates would not be materialto operations, cash flows or fair value.      We are subject to interest rate risk on our $1.0 million of treasury billsat December  31,  2003. A  hypothetical  10% change in interest  rates would notresult in a material change in their fair value.      The mutual fund  securities  portfolio  was invested in a quoted fund thatwas  managed by an  institution  which  primarily  invests in  investment  gradesecurities,  with up to a maximum of 10% invested in high yield securities ratedB or higher. These securities were subject to equity price risk.      We are also  subject to  interest  rate risk on our $0.6  million and $2.0million of notes receivable from unconsolidated  affiliates at December 31, 2003and 2002,  respectively.  A hypothetical  10% change in interest rates would notresult in a material change in their fair value.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK      Our  earnings  are  affected  by  fluctuations  in the value of the UnitedStates dollar as compared  with foreign  currencies,  predominately  the Britishpound and the euro, due to our operations in the United Kingdom and Europe.      We manage foreign currency risk through the structure of our business.  Inthe substantial majority of our transactions, we receive payments denominated inthe United States dollar or British pounds sterling.  Therefore,  we do not relyon  international  currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid  currencies.  Theforeign  currency  exposure  that  does  exist is  limited  by the fact that themajority of transactions are paid according to our standard payment terms, whichare  generally  short-term in nature.  For the year ended  December 31, 2003, werecorded a foreign exchange translation gain of $0.3 million.ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
