Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   Overview   We are a pioneer in electronic trading solutions. The NYFIX Marketplace is a global community of trading counterparties utilizing innovative services that optimize the business of trading, including trading workstations, middle office trade automation technologies and trade messaging services. NYFIX Millennium provides the NYFIX Marketplace with enhanced methods of accessing liquidity. We also provide value-added informational and analytic services and tools for measuring execution quality. As a trusted business partner and service provider to investment managers, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund managers (the Buy-Side) andbrokerage firms and banks (the Sell-Side), NYFIX enables low touch, low impact market access and transaction processing.   We operate businesses that design, produce and sell technology-based products and services to professional financial services organizations that are engaged in trading activities including traditional asset management (including the trading of those assets), proprietary trading, and/or the handling of client orders in the U.S. and international securities markets.   Many of our products and services utilize the FIX Protocol which is a messaging standard developed specifically for real-time electronic exchange of securities trading information.   We believe our innovative NYFIX products and services deliver value-added improvements in speed, quality of execution and cost efficiency by automating both the work flows at the user work station level and the interactive process of transmitting and executing orders between the Buy-Side and the Sell-Side, and through exchanges (e.g., NYSE, NYSE Alternext, Nasdaq and other exchanges), the OTC market, ATSs and electronic communication networks, or ECNs.   Sources of Revenue   Our revenues consist of subscription and maintenance fees, transaction fees, and product sales and services revenues. As a percentage of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2008, subscription and maintenance revenues accounted for 60%, transaction revenue accounted for 38%, and product sales and services revenue accounted for 2%.    27      Our subscription and maintenance revenues principally consist of revenues from contracts that provide for the use of our systems and our messaging channels, together with managed services. Subscription and maintenance revenue rates are fixed based on a contractual period of time. Additional services, provided under schedules, or addenda to the contracts, have provisions similar to the original contract. Under the terms of the subscription contracts and addenda, clients are typically invoiced a flat periodic charge after initial installation and acceptance. Subscription and maintenance also includes maintenance contracts for software under separate,renewable maintenance contracts. Software related maintenance contracts are generally for a term of one year. Revenue related to these contracts and addenda is recognized over the term of the contract, addendum, or service period, on a straight-line basis. We include within our subscription and maintenance revenue amounts we charge for connectivity to the NYFIX Marketplace Platform, including telecommunications, installation and maintenance of routers, network management software, support staff, and other costs related to the management of connectivity. The connectivity charges are recognized as the services are provided.   Our subscriptions and maintenance revenues are not directly affected by trading volumes; however, trading volumes do affect the revenues of our clients and this could affect their future purchases of our technology and services. Pricing pressures due to competition, failure to maintain revenues with existing clients and to sign agreements with new clients because of reductions in their technology spending, consolidation of brokerages and hedge fund closures could affect our revenues and profitability. Our costs associated with supporting the subscription and maintenance agreements are generally fixed and thus a loss of revenue woulddisproportionately impact profitability.   Transaction revenue primarily consists of per-share commissions charged to clients who send and receive a match and execution in our NYFIX Millennium ATS and clients to whom we provide execution and smart order routing technology, gateways to access markets and algorithmic trading ability in: (i) their own name, (ii) a third party name, or (iii) our name. Revenue for these services is generally invoiced monthly in arrears or is obtained through the clearing process within three days of the trade date, and is recognized on a trade date basis, in the period in which it is earned. Transaction revenue also includes the net interest spread on our matchedbook of securities borrowed/loaned.   Because commission revenues are earned on a per-transaction basis, such revenues fluctuate from period to period depending on (i) the volume of securities traded through our services in the U.S. and the U.K. and (ii) our commission rates. Commission revenues are primarily generated by orders delivered to us from direct computer-to-computer links driven by our clients routing technology, our FIXTrader order management system and other vendors products, as well as third party order routing networks and phone orders from our customers.   We believe that the factors that most influence our transaction volumes are the following:        macro trends in the global equities markets that affect overall institutional equity trading activity;          competitive pressure, including pricing, created by a proliferation of electronic execution competitors;          potential changes in the U.S. market structure;          new regulatory requirements or a failure to comply with existing regulatory requirements;          service quality and availability;          consolidation of broker-dealers or a decline in the number of hedge funds; and          increased client demands for bandwidth and speed, requiring reinvestment in hardware and software.     Product sales and services are primarily comprised of FIX software licenses and professional services fees. This revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and accepted by the client and when other contractual obligations, including installation, if applicable, have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.    28      Cost of Revenue   Cost of revenue includes the following:        Data center operating costs, including salaries, related to equipment, infrastructure and software supporting operations and the NYFIX Marketplace;          Managed connectivity costs, including telecommunication and other costs incurred on behalf of clients, and costs to maintain the data centers, including depreciation and amortization of assets utilized by the data centers, which are recognized as either a cost of subscription and maintenance or cost of transaction revenue, as appropriate;          Fees paid to third-party technology providers to access and provide services to their client base;          Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets and capitalized software costs relating to the applicable revenue category;          Developer and quality assurance personnel labor for client and product support of software products;          The cost of leased subscription and service bureau equipment, which is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment; and          Execution and clearing costs to access various markets and exchanges and to process and settle transactions.     Recent Developments   Discontinuance of the Fusion OMS Product   In October 2007, we made a decision to discontinue our Fusion OMS product. In connection with this decision, we offered one-time termination benefits to affected employees. We recorded a restructuring charge of $0.7 million for 2008, which consisted of retention and severance costs. In addition, we incurred a loss during 2008 of $0.8 million to support the Fusion OMS product during its wind-down phase. We completed the migration of clients off the Fusion OMS system as of June 30, 2008 and do not expect to incur any additional costs related to this product going forward.   In addition to generating subscription revenue for the Fusion OMS product, these clients also used our transaction and FIX Marketplace services. As compared to 2007, our overall revenues from Fusion OMS clients were down $9.8 million during 2008, across all businesses.   Euro Millennium   During the second quarter of 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new initiative, Euro Millennium, a multilateral trading facility for non displayed liquidity in pan-European listed equities. This initiative leverages our experience gained with NYFIX Millennium in the U.S. with our goal of global expansion during a time of rapid regulatory change. During 2008 and 2007, we incurred costs of $9.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to this initiative. These costs include compensation and related costs, consulting, marketing and travel related costs. Due to the recent growth in matched volumes and revenues, we have determined thateffective January 1, 2009 Euro Millennium is no longer in its introductory phase and we will report the results of this initiative within the Transaction Services Division, with specific costs included in transaction cost of revenue and the various SG&A categories detailed below. Operating losses from Euro Millennium are expected to continue during 2009, although such amounts are expected to decline throughout the year as revenues grow.   The FSA, along with other European regulators, is currently conducting an extensive review of the impact that MiFID has had on European markets. In connection with this review, the FSA has interpreted a particular provision of MiFID in a way that will require modifications to Euro Millenniums current functionality. Such modifications will result in additional development costs for us. Despite the fact that we believe that we are currently operating Euro Millennium in a manner that is fully compliant with MiFID, a position supported by external legal counsel opinions obtained at the request of the FSA, we are engaged in ongoing conversationswith the FSA regarding this interpretation and expect to find a mutually acceptable solution. This solution, however, could have an impact on Euro Millenniums service. In addition, there can be    29      no assurance that we will be able to make any required modifications within a timeframe acceptable to the FSA. To the extent that we cannot meet the FSAs timeframe, the FSA could react in a variety of ways ranging from an extension of our deadline for compliance to enforcement action or potential revocation of our MTF operating license. We would vigorously appeal any such action.   FIXCITY Acquisition   In April 2008, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of FIXCITY, a U.K.-based specialist in web-based electronic trading and liquidity discovery solutions. We have included the operating results of FIXCITY in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition, including revenues of $2.0 million during 2008.   During 2008, we incurred integration charges related to the FIXCITY acquisition of $0.8 million, comprised of a $0.5 million write-off of capitalized software costs, as the technology acquired from FIXCITY replaced certain of our capitalized initiatives, as well as $0.3 million of third-party costs related to the integration of the technology platforms. These integration efforts were complete as of December 31, 2008 and as a result, we do not expect any additional integration costs in 2009.   Pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement, we paid £3.3 million (or approximately $6.6 million) in cash and also agreed to pay an additional $1.0 million in cash contingent on the successful completion of the integration of the existing FIXCITY and NYFIX technology platforms within six months of the closing date. In October 2008, we determined that the integration contingency was satisfied and made the $1.0 million payment. This payment was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as part of goodwill. We incurred $0.7 million in legal and consulting fees related to this acquisition.   In addition, the share purchase agreement provides the potential for cash earn-out payments in years 1, 2 and 3 following the acquisition totaling up to £3.7 million (or approximately $5.4 million) if certain revenue targets are achieved, with potential additional payments based on varying percentages of all such revenue if higher revenue thresholds are achieved.   Settlement of Litigation   On February 25, 2009, we entered into a global settlement agreement relating to the derivative litigation matters for historical stock option granting practices, which is pending court approval, The agreement provides that we adopt certain corporate governance practices and provides for a payment of $1.3 million in legal fees to plaintiffs counsel that will be paid directly by our insurance carrier. As a result of this settlement, which was substantially agreed to by year-end 2008, we recognized into earnings $10.1 million of insurance advances in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the basis of our belief that it is highly probable that we willretain these amounts. This benefit is reflected as a reduction to SEC investigation, restatement and other related expenses as the amounts recovered were previously expensed in this line item.    30      Results of Operations   The following table presents our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated.

and Maintenance   Subscription and maintenance revenue increased during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in subscriptions (and related managed services) for order routing messaging channels offered by our FIX Division and to the impact of our FIXCITY acquisition, offset in part by a decrease in subscriptions (and related managed services) for our OMS Division products. FIXCITY, which was acquired in April 2008, contributed $2.0 million in subscription revenues during 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we had 9,588 billable direct order routing messaging channels in service, an increase of 16% over the 8,270 messaging channels in service at December31, 2007. The growth in our messaging channel subscription revenue during 2008 was slowed by a decrease in revenues of $1.1 million attributable to former Fusion OMS clients, as compared to 2007. The decline in subscriptions (and related managed services) for our OMS Division products to $4.7 million in 2008 from $10.5 million in 2007, was due primarily to the discontinuation of our Fusion OMS product, as well as related cancellations from other desktop clients. OMS subscription revenue from former Fusion OMS clients decreased by $3.1 million during 2008 as compared to 2007. As a result of recent consolidations in the brokerage industry, we expect the growth in subscription and maintenance revenues from messaging channels to be offset in 2009 by $1.5 million due to ongoing and expected cancellations for duplicate services from these clients. We also expect increased cancellations in order routing channels in 2009 due to hedge fund closures. Revenue from recurring maintenance onlicensed software was $3.8 million in both 2008 and 2007.   The increase in subscription and maintenance revenue during 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in subscriptions (and related managed services) for messaging channels offered by our FIX Division. This growth was attributable to an increase in the number of Buy-Side to Sell-Side messaging channels, primarily for order routing, as we continued our efforts to increase the level of business with Buy-Side institutions. As of December 31, 2007, we had 8,270 billable order routing messaging channels in service, an increase of 22% over the 6,796 billable order routing channels in service at December 31, 2006. This increase was partially offset bya decrease in subscriptions (and related managed services) for our OMS Division desktop and floor products to $10.5 million in 2007 from $18.9 million in 2006. This revenue decrease in the OMS Division is due primarily to the discontinuation (during the second quarter of 2007) of certain floor application products as well as cancellations from certain desktop clients. In October 2007, we decided to discontinue the Fusion OMS product and entered into a strategic arrangement with Lava to offer NYFIX Fusion OMS customers a transition arrangement to Lavas ColorPalette® OMS. Recurring maintenance on licensed software decreased $0.3 million to $3.8 million in 2007 as compared to $4.1 million in 2006.   Transaction   The decrease in transaction revenue during 2008 was primarily attributable to a decrease in commissions on trade executions. Commissions decreased to $43.8 million during 2008 from $51.0 million during 2007, primarily due to decreases in commissions of $6.4 million and $0.8 million from Sell-Side and Buy-Side clients, respectively. The decrease from Sell-Side clients was primarily due to a decrease in the use of our NIX algorithmic trading products and in commissions from direct market access services, offset in part by an increase in commissions from NYFIX Millennium and Euro Millennium. The decline in revenue from our NIX algorithmic tradingproducts and from OTC direct market access was primarily attributable to lower volumes from former Fusion OMS clients. Transaction revenue from former Fusion OMS clients decreased by $5.6 million during 2008 compared to 2007. The additional decline in revenue from NYSE DOT direct market access services (including associated pass-through charges) of $6.2 million was primarily attributable to our    32      decision to improve our margins by eliminating discounts for these services below cost for clients who do not generate valuable pass-through matches in NYFIX Millennium. The average daily matched volume in NYFIX Millennium during 2008 was 48.6 million shares, a 5% increase over the average of 46.4 million shares during 2007.   The decrease from Buy-Side clients was due in part to the disintermediation of our direct Buy-Side client base by third-party algorithmic trading solution providers who offer enhanced technology solutions for certain clients. Our securities lending business generated net interest spread on its matched book stock borrow/stock loan portfolio of $1.1 million during 2008, compared to $1.3 million during 2007.   The increase in transaction revenue during 2007 was attributable to an increase in commissions (including related billed pass-through amounts) on trade executions. Commissions increased $22.8 million to $51.0 million during 2007 compared to $28.2 million during 2006 due primarily to a $21.6 million increase in commissions from Sell-Side clients and a $1.2 million increase in commissions from Buy-Side clients. The increase from Sell-Side clients was due to increased matched volumes in NYFIX Millennium, increased use of the NIX algorithmic trading products and an increase in commissions for DMA and related pass-through fees. The average daily matchedvolume in NYFIX Millennium during 2007 was 46.4 million shares, an 89% increase over the average of 24.5 million shares during 2006. This increase reflects the continued popularity of dark pool matching venues for trading and algorithmic trading solutions sponsored by broker dealers. The growth in commissions from Buy-Side clients was attributable in part to the re-alignment of our sales team around customer segments, which has enabled us to better focus on our direct Buy-Side sales efforts. Our securities lending business generated comparable net interest spread on its matched book stock borrow/stock loan portfolio of $1.3 million during 2007, compared to $1.4 million during 2006.   Included in the NYFIX Millennium volume figures reported above are conditional orders executed against pass-through orders, other conditional orders and IOCs.   Product Sales and Services   Product sales and services revenues decreased to $2.1 million in 2008 from $2.2 million in 2007. License fees for our FIX software products were comparable at $1.4 million for 2008 and 2007. Our ability to grow license fees during 2008 was impacted by an increase in customers subscribing to our FIX software products on a monthly basis instead of purchasing the licenses as a one-time upfront fee. Professional services revenue, including training, decreased by $0.1 million to $0.7 million in 2008 as compared to $0.8 million in 2007.   Product sales and services revenues decreased $0.7 million to $2.2 million in 2007 as compared to $2.9 million in 2006 primarily due to a decrease in sales of software licenses of our FIX products due to a decrease in international revenues, as the overseas markets tightened in late 2007. License fees for our FIX software products decreased $0.9 million to $1.4 million in 2007, as compared to $2.3 million in 2006, partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in professional services revenue, which increased to $0.8 million in 2007 as compared to $0.6 million in 2006 primarily due to the implementation of our professional training programs at the endof 2006.   Costs and Expenses   Cost of Revenue   The following table presents our cost of revenue:                                                                               Year Ended  December 31,     Decrease     Year Ended  December 31,     Increase (Decrease)    (in thousands, except percentages)     2008     2007     $     %     2007     2006     $     %    Subscription and maintenance     $  30,997        $  34,381        $  (3,384  )          -10  %       $  34,381        $  32,638        $  1,743           5  %      Transaction        23,314           29,916           (6,602  )          -22  %          29,916           15,901           14,015           88  %      Product sales and services        340           813           (473  )          -58  %          813           1,824           (1,011  )          -55  %      Total cost of revenue     $  54,651        $  65,110        $  (10,459  )          -16  %       $  65,110        $  50,363        $  14,747           29  %      Percent of total revenue        46.5  %          53.5  %                              53.5  %          51.2  %                           33      Subscription and Maintenance   The decrease in subscription and maintenance cost of revenue during 2008 was primarily attributable to lower costs resulting from the discontinuation of the Fusion OMS product, including a decrease in allocated labor costs of $2.4 million, a decrease in amortization of capitalized software costs and other intangible assets of $1.0 million, and a decrease in market data fees of $0.4 million, as well as decreases in communication costs of $0.8 million and decreases in various other costs. These decreases were slightly offset by an increase of $1.4 million in fees paid to third-party order management system providers to establish messaging channels withtheir clients. As a percentage of related revenue, these costs decreased to 44% in 2008 as compared to 51% in 2007, reflecting the profitability of incremental revenue generated by our FIX Division.   The increase in subscription and maintenance cost of revenue during 2007 was primarily attributable to increases in our infrastructure including increases in allocated data center facility and maintenance costs of $1.1 million and market data costs of $0.5 million, an increase of $0.7 million in fees paid to third-party order management system providers to establish messaging channels with their clients, an increase of $0.6 million in telecommunication costs and investments in our subscription-based products, including higher depreciation costs of $0.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of capitalizedsoftware costs of $1.0 million and a decrease in intangible asset amortization of $0.2 million and decreases in various other costs. As a percentage of related revenue, these costs were comparable at 51% and 50% for 2007 and 2006, respectively.   Transaction   Transaction cost of revenue decreased during 2008 primarily due to lower execution and clearing fees of $11.2 million, offset in part by an increase in losses incurred on trade errors of $0.7 million and by higher costs due to the redeployment of resources following the discontinuation of the Fusion OMS product. These higher amounts included an increase in allocated data center costs of $1.2 million, an increase in depreciation costs of $1.0 million, an increase in allocated labor costs of $0.7 million, an increase in market data fees of $0.5 million, an increase in software maintenance of $0.2 million and an increase in communication costs of $0.1million. The decrease in execution and clearing fees was primarily due to a change in our revenue mix to higher margin services and a rebate received during the first quarter of $0.5 million for clearing services used. Included in execution fees during 2007 was $1.9 million of linkage fees from the NYSE to route orders to other market centers which we were not able to pass through to our DOT direct market access clients due to difficulties in capturing trade information. Losses from trade errors in 2008 of $1.0 million primarily reflected the impact of erroneous trades following a required migration to a new NYSE communications gateway as a result of execution reports not being received into our algorithms, which led to duplicative orders. As a percentage of related revenue, transaction cost of revenue decreased to 52% in 2008 as compared to 57% in 2007.   The increase in transaction cost of revenue during 2007 was due primarily to an increase in execution and clearing fees of $13.2 million, of which $3.5 million related to pass-through execution costs, reflecting an increase related to NYSE linkage fees offset in part by a decrease related to exchange specialist fees. Due to difficulties we had in capturing the trade information for NYSE outbound routed orders on a real time basis from March 5, 2007 through May 31, 2007, we were not able to timely notify our DMA clients of the pass through NYSE linkage fees and, as a result, did not record any offsetting revenue from these clients related to $1.9million of these charges during this period. In addition, allocated data center facility and maintenance costs were higher by $0.5 million. As a percentage of related revenue, transaction cost of revenue was 57% during 2007, compared to 54% during 2006, reflecting in part the impact of NYSE linkage fees that were not passed through.   Product Sales and Services   The decrease in product sales and services cost of revenue during 2008 was attributable to a decrease in intangible asset amortization of $0.4 million as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the first half of 2007 and a $0.1 million decrease in amortization of capitalized software costs. As a percentage of related revenue, these costs decreased to 16% during 2008 compared to 36% in 2007.    34      The decrease in product sales and services cost of revenue during 2007 was attributable to a decrease in intangible asset amortization of $0.7 million as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the first half of 2007, a decrease in amortization of capitalized software costs of $0.2 million and decreases in various other costs. As a percentage of related revenue, these costs decreased to 36% during 2007 compared to 62% in 2006.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)   The following table presents the components of our selling, general and administrative expense:                                                                               Year Ended  December 31,     Increase (Decrease)     Year Ended  December 31,     Increase    (in thousands, except percentages)     2008     2007     $     %     2007     2006     $     %    Compensation and related     $  35,266        $  34,368        $  898           3  %       $  34,368        $  26,064        $  8,304           32  %      Occupancy and related        4,453           4,516           (63  )          -1  %          4,516           3,124           1,392           45  %      Marketing, travel and entertainment        4,372           4,638           (266  )          -6  %          4,638           2,975           1,663           56  %      Professional fees (including consulting)        8,009           14,697           (6,688  )          -46  %          14,697           7,940           6,757           85  %      Stock-based compensation        7,324           5,579           1,745           31  %          5,579           747           4,832           647  %      Transitional rebuilding and remediation        212           6,359           (6,147  )                     6,359                      6,359                  Transitional employment costs        243           4,047           (3,804  )          -94  %          4,047           1,945           2,102                  Euro Millenium costs        9,219           3,952           5,267                      3,952                      3,952                  General and other        5,577           8,692           (3,115  )          -36  %          8,692           6,442           2,250           35  %      Total SG&A     $  74,675        $  86,848        $  (12,173  )          -14  %       $  86,848        $  49,237        $  37,611           76  %      Percent of total revenue        63.5  %          71.4  %                              71.4  %          50.1  %                          Since we completed our restatement and relisting initiatives, as well as our transitional programs, we have increased our focus on improving our margins and more actively managing our cost structure. We realized significant achievements from these efforts during 2008. Excluding stock-based compensation, Euro Millennium and transitional costs, SG&A for 2008 decreased by 14% over 2007, due primarily to reduced costs for outside professionals (e.g., legal and accounting), consultants and various other expenses.   Compensation and Related   The increase in compensation and related costs included in SG&A for 2008 was primarily due to an increase of $4.0 million associated with investments in sales, account management and marketing resources, new compensation costs of $0.9 million associated with our FIXCITY subsidiary, and $0.9 million of employee termination costs associated with the approximate 10% reduction of our staff in June 2008, as well as other executive severance costs. These increases for 2008 were offset in part by cost reductions associated with the discontinuation of the Fusion OMS product of $3.3 million and savings realized in the second half of the year related tothe staff reduction.   Occupancy and Related   Occupancy and related costs were comparable for 2008 and 2007, reflecting the net effects of a reduction associated with $0.3 million of rent tax credits received in 2008 for our 100 Wall Street office location under the Lower Manhattan Revitalization Program and increases associated with the expansion of office space in both our New York City and London locations.   The increase in occupancy and related costs during 2007 was primarily due to additional rent expense associated with the expansion of office space in both our New York City and London locations and increases in office relocation and other operating expenses.    35      Marketing, Travel and Entertainment   The decrease in marketing, travel and entertainment expenses during 2008 primarily reflects a decrease in overall travel and entertainment costs of $0.5 million resulting primarily from a reduction in general corporate travel, partially offset by an $0.2 million increase in marketing costs related to our efforts to market our products, including participation in industry trade shows and product promotion.   The increase in marketing, travel and entertainment expenses during 2007 primarily reflected our efforts to market our products including participation in industry trade shows and product promotion and increases in employee travel related costs to support our European expansion efforts.   Professional Fees (Including Consulting)   The decrease in professional fees in 2008 was primarily due to reduced usage of consultants and external professionals. Consulting fees decreased $4.5 million, primarily due to the reduction in consultants used for organizational development, operational process improvements, marketing and strategic initiatives. Professional fees declined $2.2 million primarily due to decreases in external costs for internal controls compliance and outside legal fees.   The increase in professional fees incurred during 2007 was primarily due to the use of consultants for organizational development, marketing, public relations and operational process improvements, as well as increases in internal control compliance and legal fees. Consultants and outside professionals were engaged in 2007 to supplement day-to-day activities while management was addressing significant matters such as the restatements, relisting on Nasdaq, historical legal issues and remediation. Consulting fees included in this category do not include the time spent by outside consultants and advisors on the SEC investigation, restatements and relatedissues as such costs have been separately categorized below.   Stock-Based Compensation   The increase in stock-based compensation included in SG&A in 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to grants of stock options and restricted stock units covering 9.9 million shares made in October 2007 following the adoption of the 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. These grants were intended to be an up-front, multi-year program designed to assist in retention and to further promote alignment of employee interests with those of our stockholders. In 2009, stock-based compensation expense for currently outstanding awards is expected to be $1.5 million per quarter. Stock-based compensation amounts may vary, however, depending on the level of futuregrants, the fair value of performance awards when the applicable criteria are established and whether such performance awards actually vest.   Transitional Rebuilding and Remediation Costs   Transitional rebuilding and remediation costs reflect the impact of a company-wide, Board-approved effort in 2007, following the $75 million preferred stock investment by Warburg Pincus, to remediate deficiencies involving critical operational systems and processes, including technology infrastructure and management information systems. As a result of this effort, during 2007, we remediated our lab environment, data replication and back-up, network monitoring, application security and we enabled more timely and detailed internal and external financial reporting. These efforts also addressed certain historical administrative issues such asreorganizing certain subsidiaries and initiating new compensation programs which were rolled out in October 2007. During 2008, we incurred $0.2 million of such costs. This program was fully completed in June 2008.   Transitional Employment Costs   Transitional employment costs reflect our efforts to build critical teams, retain key employees, and remediate certain skill gaps. These transitional costs, primarily consisting of sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses and severance and other termination benefits were expensed over the required service period. During 2008, we incurred $0.2 million of such costs. The required service period under this program ended in June 2008.    36      Euro Millennium Costs   During 2008 and 2007, we incurred costs of $9.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to Euro Millennium. These costs include compensation and related costs, consulting, marketing and travel related costs. Due to the recent growth in matched volumes and revenues, we have determined that effective January 1, 2009 Euro Millennium is no longer in its introductory phase and we will report the results of this initiative within the Transaction Services Division, with specific costs included in transaction cost of revenue and the various SG&A categories detailed above.   General and Other   The decrease in general and other expenses in 2008 primarily reflects a decrease in recruiting fees of $1.5 million, a $0.4 million decrease in bad debt expense related to our accounts receivable, a $0.2 million decrease in temporary administrative help, a $0.2 million decrease in insurance related costs and decreases in various other general expense. These increases were partially offset by $0.3 million of higher software maintenance for our internal systems.   The increase in general and other expenses in 2007 primarily reflects an increase in recruiting fees, various municipal taxes, higher software maintenance costs and increases in various other general expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in costs for temporary administrative help.    Other Operating Expenses   Other operating expenses consist of the following:                                     Year Ended  December 31,     Increase  (Decrease)     Year Ended  December 31,     Increase  (Decrease)    (in thousands)     2008     2007     $     2007     2006     $    Depreciation and amortization     $  1,907        $  1,554        $  353        $  1,554        $  1,185        $  369       Integration charges        838                      838                                        SEC investigation, restatement and other related expenses        (9,550  )          5,846           (15,396  )          5,846           12,758           (6,912  )      Restructuring charge        216           331           (115  )          331           2,056           (1,725  )      Asset impairment charge        11,651           7,596           4,055           7,596                      7,596       Depreciation and Amortization   The increase in the portion of depreciation and amortization not included in cost of revenue during 2008 and 2007 was due to increased capital expenditures as a result of our remediation efforts.   Integration Charges   During 2008, we incurred integration charges related to the acquisition of FIXCITY. These costs include $0.3 million of third party consulting costs to integrate the acquired technology platform and a $0.5 million write-off of capitalized software costs as the technology acquired from FIXCITY replaced certain of our capitalized initiatives. These integration efforts were complete as of December 31, 2008 and as a result, we do not expect any additional integration costs in 2009.   SEC Investigation, Restatement and Other Related Expenses   Since 2005, we have incurred costs relating to the stock option investigation and subpoenas, a grand jury subpoena related to our stock option grants, related shareholder derivative litigation, related financial restatements and expenses to resolve related matters, together with the NYFIX Millennium SEC inquiry, related class action litigation and related financial restatement. These costs include expenses for outside counsel, contract attorneys and forensic accountants, other consultants and the cost of re-auditing previously issued financial statements following the resignation of our prior independent registered public accounting firm. These costsdo not include any portion of time that our employees have dedicated to these matters.    37      Due to an agreement reached in February 2009 for a global settlement relating to the derivative litigation matters for historical stock option granting practices, including direct payment by our insurance carrier of $1.3 million in fees to plaintiffs counsel, we recognized an insurance benefit in the fourth quarter of 2008 of $10.1 million for advances received under our D&O insurance policies. This amount is reflected as a reduction to SEC investigation, restatement and other related expenses as the amounts recovered were previously expensed in this line item.   The decrease in 2007 reflects the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2005 in March of 2007 following the restatement of our consolidated financial statements as a result of the SEC investigation into prior stock option grants and related restatements. The 2006 amount included costs related to the SEC inquiry into our historical accounting for NYFIX Millennium, as well as penalties of $0.6 million due to the delinquency in meeting our periodic reporting obligations under a registration rights agreement related to the private placement transaction which closed in July 2006 and $0.4 million of aggregate expense related to modifications to cashsettle expiring stock options and to extend the normal 90-day post-termination exercise period. In 2007, $0.1 million of the stock-option modification charge described above was reversed.   Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges   In 2008, we took an asset impairment charge as a result of our annual testing for goodwill impairment performed in the fourth quarter of 2008. Due to adverse market conditions in the latter part of 2008 that caused a decline in industry market multiples, we determined that the goodwill assigned to the Transaction Services Division had been impaired and recorded an impairment charge to write-off the balance outstanding at October 1, 2008 of $11.7 million. We believe that the remaining $47.2 million of goodwill assigned to the FIX Division is supported by the current and projected earnings stream of that reporting unit.   The asset impairment and restructuring charges in 2007 were the result of our decision to discontinue our Fusion OMS business. In connection with exiting the Fusion OMS business, we recorded a combined charge of $7.9 million. This charge primarily reflects non-cash impairment charges of $6.1 million for goodwill and intangible assets, originally recorded as part of our full acquisition of Renaissance Trading Technologies, LLC (Renaissance) in 2003, and $1.5 million for capitalized software costs related to the Fusion OMS product offerings, as well as $0.3 million of employment related restructuring charges. We continued to incur costsrelated to this effort in 2008, including additional employment related restructuring charges of $0.7 million, partially offset by a $0.5 million reversal of amounts previously recorded as restructuring costs as a result of the termination of our lease and corresponding sublease of office space previously occupied in Stamford, Connecticut.   The restructuring charge in 2006 was the result of relocating our corporate headquarters from Stamford to 100 Wall Street, New York City. This charge reflected the fair value of the remaining rent payments for the closed office, net of sublease income, plus real estate commissions, leasehold improvements for the subtenant, employment costs, moving costs and write-offs of property and equipment.   Other Income (Expense)   Other income (expense) items are as follows:                                     Year Ended  December 31,     Increase  (Decrease)     Year Ended  December 31,     Increase  (Decrease)    (in thousands)     2008     2007     $     2007     2006     $    Interest expense     $  (763  )       $  (565  )       $  198        $  (565  )       $  (1,029  )       $  (464  )      Investment income        1,357           4,114           (2,757  )          4,114           1,894           2,220       Other income (expense), net        (25  )          (3  )          (22  )          (3  )          20           (23  )      Interest Expense   The increase in interest expense during 2008 was primarily attributable to $0.1 million of additional interest related to the $2.5 million convertible note issued in October 2007 and $0.1 million incurred related to increased capital lease obligations.    38      The decrease in interest expense during 2007 was primarily attributable to additional interest incurred of $0.5 million in 2006 as a result of our failure to register the shares underlying the $7.5 million convertible note issued on December 30, 2004.   Investment Income   The decrease in 2008 reflects lower average cash balances invested and lower interest rates during the year, while the increase in 2007 reflects higher average cash balances invested during the year due to the private placement investments in 2006.   Income Tax Provision (Benefit)   The income tax provision in 2008 reflects the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes associated with the October 2007 acquisition of the minority interest in NYFIX Millennium, through the time of the impairment taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. The income tax benefit for 2007 reflects the net impact of eliminating the deferred tax liability of $0.6 million related to goodwill from the Renaissance acquisition following the impairment determination in October 2007, offset in part by amortizing the tax basis of the Renaissance goodwill up until the impairment determination, the amortization of goodwill associated with the October 31, 2007acquisition of the minority interest in NYFIX Millennium and the tax expense associated with a foreign subsidiary. The income tax provisions for 2006 were solely attributable to the impact of deducting the Renaissance goodwill in our tax filings. All other tax effects during 2008, 2007 and 2006 have been netted out in our deferred tax asset valuation reflecting our view that historical pre-tax book income and historical income for tax purposes are not sufficient to support a conclusion that the value of our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Until we achieve and sustain an appropriate level of profitability, we plan to maintain a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets.   Income from Discontinued Operations   Discontinued operations in 2007 reflects $0.7 million of income associated with NYFIX Overseas, including a $1.9 million gain related to the earn-out payment received, net of amounts payable to the NYFIX Overseas management team. This was offset in part by an accrual of $1.1 million related to an estimated tax contingency associated with historical stock option issues and $0.1 million of associated professional fees.   The initial gain recorded in 2006 on the sale of NYFIX Overseas of $4.0 million, together with the operating results of the former OBMS Division through the August 25, 2006 closing date have been classified and presented as discontinued operations.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   We derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from operations, issuances of stock and from long-term borrowings. At December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of $56.0 million. We believe that resources available at December 31, 2008 will be sufficient to finance our current investing and operational needs, as well as the net capital requirements of our broker-dealer subsidiaries for at least the next twelve months, including with respect to repayment of our convertible notes aggregating $10.0 million due on December 30, 2009. In light of current credit market conditions, however, there can be no assurance that, should we need toobtain additional financing for any reason, such financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all.   At December 31, 2008, $39.0 million of our total cash and cash equivalents were held in our U.S. and U.K. registered broker dealer subsidiaries.    39                            As of December 31,    (in thousands)     2008     2007     2006    Cash and cash equivalents     $  55,966        $  75,657        $  105,888       Short-term investments                              500       Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments     $  55,966        $  75,657        $  106,388                             Year Ended December 31,           2008     2007     2006    Net cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities     $  7,050        $  (12,966  )       $  3,288       Net cash (used in) provided by continuing investing activities        (24,109  )          (18,656  )          717       Net cash (used in) provided by continuing financing activities        (1,615  )          1,353           80,458       Discontinued operations                              193       Effect of exchange rate changes on cash        (1,017  )          38           166       Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents     $  (19,691  )       $  (30,231  )       $  84,822       Operating Activities   The following table sets forth our net loss adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, integration and restructuring charges and stock-based compensation; and the effect on cash generated by operating activities of changes in working capital and other operating accounts between years.                         Year Ended December 31,    (in thousands)     2008     2007     2006    Income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash items     $  14,666        $  (18,016  )       $  (2,301  )      Effect of changes in working capital and other operating  accounts        (7,616  )          5,050           5,589       Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities     $  7,050        $  (12,966  )       $  3,288       Changes in working capital and other operating accounts affected cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 primarily as a result of changes in the levels of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses between periods. The increase in cash provided by operations in 2008 is primarily due to improved results from continuing operations as a result of cost management initiatives implemented during the year.   Broker-Dealer Operations   Clearing assets reflect amounts on hand to support our ability to clear the transactions of NYFIX Millennium NYFIX Securities and NYFIX International, such as receivables from clearing organizations and deposits with clearing firms, as well as balances to support our matched-book stock borrow/stock loan business. Our matched-book balances include offsetting stock borrowed and stock loaned and offsetting securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive. At December 31, 2008, the net balance for clearing assets and clearing liabilities was a receivable of $0.7 million.   Securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral provided for securities borrowed transactions and received for securities loaned transactions, plus accrued interest. We monitor the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary. At December 31, 2008, clearing assets include stock borrows of $396.8 million and clearing liabilities include stock loans of $397.3 million.   NYFIX Millennium and NYFIX Securities are U.S. registered broker-dealers required to maintain levels of regulatory net capital under Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act. NYFIX Securities DTCC membership, used to self-clear securities transactions, requires it to maintain $10 million in excess of its required net capital. NYFIX International and FIXCITY are registered firms with the FSA, required to maintain the greater of the base capital resources requirement of €730,000 and €50,000, respectively, or the variable capital resources    40      requirement, which is made up of credit risk, market risk and fixed overhead (equal to three months average expenditures) requirements. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate regulatory net capital/resources of our regulated subsidiaries in the U.S. and U.K. were $32.4 million, $20.4 million in excess of our aggregate requirement of $12.0 million (including the $10 million excess required by DTCC).   When Euro Millennium initiated trading activities in March 2008, the minimum financial resources requirement for NYFIX International increased to approximately €730,000. To satisfy this requirement, $1.5 million of subordinated debt issued to NYFIX, Inc. by NYFIX International was converted into equity capital in March 2008. In addition, in 2008, we infused an additional $3.0 million of equity capital into NYFIX International to provide further regulatory capital resources to meet daily regulatory requirements and to allow for further business expansion.   Investing Activities   Investments in current technology to maintain our infrastructure and to enhance our products remain an important requirement for our available cash resources.   Net cash used in investing activities in 2008 was $24.1 million. This consisted of capital expenditures for property and equipment, principally for data center equipment and software of $5.0 million, capitalized software development costs of $6.2 million, $7.2 million in payments to the former minority owners of NYFIX Millennium to acquire their interests and $7.9 million for the acquisition of FIXCITY, net of cash acquired. These payments were partially offset by $2.1 million received from GL in payment of an earn out related to the sale of NYFIX Overseas in August 2006, net of amounts paid to the NYFIX Overseas management team.   Net cash used in investing activities in 2007 was $18.7 million. This consisted primarily of capital expenditures for property and equipment, principally for data center equipment and software of $12.0 million, capitalized software costs of $4.3 million and $1.0 million was paid related to the acquisition of the minority interest of NYFIX Millennium. Also during 2007, $1.3 million of sales proceeds were repaid to GL in settlement of a working capital adjustment and $0.2 million of transaction related professional fees were paid.   Net cash provided by continuing investing activities in 2006 was $0.7 million. This consisted primarily of proceeds, net of cash disposed from the sale of NYFIX Overseas of $8.4 million, substantially offset by capital expenditures for property and equipment, principally for data center equipment and software, of $5.8 million and capitalized product enhancement costs of $2.4 million.   Financing Activities   Our financing activities primarily consist of long-term debt issued for working capital purposes, capital lease obligations used for datacenter equipment and software purchases and the issuance of capital stock for general corporate purposes and business development activities. At December 31, 2008, we had convertible notes and capital lease obligations outstanding of $10.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively (including current portions).   At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding two convertible notes aggregating $10.0 million with substantially similar terms to the same lender with an interest rate of 5%, due in December 2009. At December 31, 2008, the price at which the lender could convert the convertible notes into shares of our common stock was $5.62 per share. The conversion price may be reduced if we issue shares of common stock at a price below the conversion price in effect, excluding stock option exercises, the settlement of obligations outstanding as of the date of the convertible note and other transactions previously approved by our Board of Directors.   Net cash used in financing activities in 2008 was $1.6 million, consisting of $1.2 million of principal payments under capital lease obligations and $0.4 million of payments under vendor financed purchase arrangements.   Net cash provided by continuing financing activities in 2007 was $1.4 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from long-term borrowings of $2.5 million and proceeds of $0.4 million from the issuance of common stock resulting from the exercise of stock options partly offset by principal payments under capital lease obligations of $1.2 million.    41      Net cash provided by continuing financing activities in 2006 was $80.5 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds of $69.1 million from the private placement of 1.5 million shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (including a warrant for the purchase of 2.25 million shares of common stock), net proceeds of $12.5 million from the private placement of 2.7 million shares of our common stock (plus an additional 0.2 million shares for placement agent fees) (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the private placements of our stock). In 2006, we repaid long-term borrowings of $0.3 million (by issuing our stock) and theprincipal value of capital lease obligations of $0.7 million.   Commitments, Contingencies and Future Obligations   Commitments and Contingencies   There are various lawsuits and claims pending against us, as well as SEC and United States Attorneys Office investigations into our accounting for stock option grants and an SEC investigation into our accounting for losses incurred by NYFIX Millennium. We are currently unable to predict the outcomes and reasonably estimate the amounts of loss, if any, with respect to these matters. With respect to certain of these matters, we could be subject to penalties, fines or regulatory sanctions or claims by current and former officers, directors or employees for indemnification of costs or losses they may incur and such amounts, individually orcollectively, could have a material impact on our financial condition. In addition, other actions may be brought against us related to these matters.   For additional details with respect to these matters, see also Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Future Obligations   The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations at December 31, 2008, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Additional disclosures relating to our convertible notes, capital lease obligations and commitments appear in Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Contractual Obligations                                 Payments Due by Period    (in thousands)     Total     Less Than  1 Year     1  3 Years     3  5 Years     More Than  5 Years    Convertible notes     $  10,000        $  10,000        $          $          $         Capital lease obligations        2,827           1,358           1,469                             Operating lease obligations        26,472           7,674           11,171           7,278           349       Other long-term obligations        768           668           100                             Purchase obligations        845           434           401           10                  Total     $  40,912        $  20,134        $  13,141        $  7,288        $  349            Convertible notes include two notes with an interest rate of 5% and are due in December 2009.          Capital lease obligations include minimum lease obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year related to data center equipment and software licensing agreements.          Operating lease obligations include minimum lease obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year primarily related to office and data center space as well as certain equipment.          Other long-term obligations consist primarily of software financing arrangements.          Purchase obligations include minimum purchase obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year to certain telecommunication providers and a software licensing arrangement with a minimum licensing fee.     Seasonality and Inflation   We believe that our operations have not been significantly affected by seasonality or inflation.    42      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules, other than those related to the contingent obligations under the convertible notes as described above and under the terms of our Series B Preferred Stock as described in Notes 8 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis formaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes the accounting estimates described in the following narrative to be the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed the accounting policies and critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our independent registered public accounting firm and the AuditCommittee of our Board of Directors. The following narrative describes the critical accounting policies and estimates, the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions.   Revenue Recognition   We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the fee is fixed and determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and the arrangement does not require customization or modification.   Our revenue is comprised of subscription and maintenance, transaction revenue and product sales and services, as follows:   Subscription and maintenance revenues principally consist of revenues from contracts that provide for the use of our systems and our messaging channels, together with managed services. Subscription and maintenance revenue rates are fixed based on a contractual period of time. Additional services, provided under schedules, or addenda to the contracts have provisions similar to the original contract. Under the terms of the subscription contracts and addenda, clients are typically invoiced a flat periodic charge after initial installation and acceptance. Subscription and maintenance also includes maintenance contracts for software under separate,renewable maintenance contracts. Software related maintenance contracts are generally for a term of one year. Subscription and maintenance revenue is recognized over the term of the contract, addendum, or service period, on a straight-line basis. We include within our subscription and maintenance revenue amounts we charge for connectivity to the NYFIX Marketplace Platform, including telecommunications, installation and maintenance of routers, network management software, support staff, and other costs related to the management of connectivity. The connectivity charges are recognized as the services are provided.   Transaction revenue primarily consists of per-share commissions charged to clients who send and receive a match and execution in our NYFIX Millennium ATS and clients to whom we provide execution and smart order routing technology, gateways to access markets and algorithmic trading ability in: (i) their own name, (ii) a third party name, or (iii) our name. Revenue for these services is generally invoiced monthly in arrears or is obtained through the clearing process within three days of the trade date, and is recognized on a trade date basis, in the period in which it is earned. Transaction revenue also includes the net interest spread on our matchedbook of securities borrowed/loaned.    43      Product sales and services are primarily comprised of software licenses, equipment sales and professional services fees. This revenue is recognized when the software and equipment have been shipped and accepted by the customer and when other contractual obligations, including installation if applicable, have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from software arrangements in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2,  Software Revenue Recognition , as amended by SOP 98-9,  Modification ofSOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,  under which revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred, collectability is reasonably assured and the arrangement does not require significant customization or modification of the software.   Amounts invoiced in advance of the service being performed are deferred until earned and are included in deferred revenue. Installation charges, if any, are generally invoiced to a client and are included in revenue upon completion of the installation.   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   We are required to estimate the collectability of our trade receivables and judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of receivables, including the current credit-worthiness of each client. Allowances are established for those amounts that we believe are uncollectible due to the inability of clients to make required payments or because of billing adjustments. These allowances are estimated by considering a number of factors, including the length of time the accounts are past due, our previous loss history, the clients current ability to pay its obligations and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. Ifcircumstances change (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major clients ability to meet its financial obligations to us), our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount.   Property and Equipment   Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the assets economic lives or the lease term. In situations where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be revised, we depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life.   Acquisitions and Goodwill   Net assets of companies we acquired have been recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in an acquisition. The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , require that we allocate our goodwill to our various reporting units, determine the carrying value of those businesses, and estimate the fair value of the reporting units so that a two-step goodwill impairment test can be performed. Our reporting units represent components of ouroperating segments and are the same as the reportable segments identified in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   The two-step impairment review process is as follows:        Step 1  We compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value, including goodwill, of each of these units. For each reporting unit where the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the units fair value, we move on to Step 2. If the units fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment expense is necessary.          Step 2  If we determine in Step 1 that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non-goodwill intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. This results in an implied fair value for the reporting units goodwill. We then compare the implied      44          fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.     In the absence of circumstances requiring impairment testing on a quarterly or other more frequent basis, our annual impairment testing date is the beginning of our fourth quarter, which is October 1. Fair value assessments inherently involve estimates and judgments involving the amount and timing of cash flows that could materially differ with changes in circumstances.   Capitalized Software Costs   Costs incurred in the research, design and development of software for sale to others as a separate product or embedded in a product and sold as part of the product as a whole are charged to expense until technological feasibility is established. Thereafter, software development costs, consisting primarily of payroll and related costs, purchased materials and services and software to be used within our products, which significantly enhance the marketability or significantly extend the life of our products are capitalized, and amortized to cost of revenue on a straight-line basis over three years, beginning when the products are offered for sale orwhen the enhancements are integrated into the product. We are required to use professional judgment in determining whether product enhancement costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization, in accordance with SFAS No. 86,  Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed .   Long-Lived Assets   We review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including property and equipment; intangible assets; investments, and capitalized product enhancement costs for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. If such an event or circumstances occur, the related estimated fair value of the assets would be compared to the carrying amount, and if needed, we would record an impairment to the extent by which the carrying amount exceeded the fair value of the assets. We test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value methodology such as a cash flow model.Fair value assessments inherently involve estimates and judgments involving the amount and timing of cash flows that could materially differ with changes in circumstances.   Income Taxes   We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed in SFAS No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes  (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the recognition of tax effects for financial statement and income tax reporting purposes by applying enacted income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets to only that portion that isjudged more likely than not to be realized. Where there are cumulative losses in recent years, SFAS 109 requires, except in very limited circumstances, that a valuation allowance be established. Until we can achieve and sustain an appropriate level of profitability, we plan to maintain a valuation allowance on the realizable value of our net deferred tax assets. Income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  (FIN 48). A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur.   Contingencies   Contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Disclosure is required when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred or that the ultimate loss may exceed the recorded provision. We use outside counsel to assist us in various matters including regulations, acquisitions, trademark, patent, personnel and other matters. We rely on the professional judgment of outside counsel as well as our own assessment in determining whether contingencies should be recorded.    45      Stock-Based Compensation   We adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment  (SFAS 123(R)), on January 1, 2006 using the modified-prospective-transition method. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires assumptions and judgments about expected volatility and forfeiture rates, among other factors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, our results of operationscould be materially impacted.   With respect to certain awards, we have been confronted with various situations under which the required factual documentation necessary to determine measurement criteria was either inconsistent, incomplete or could not be located, and other situations relating to the validity and/or authorization of the grant. In these situations, our treatment is consistent with the SEC Staff guidance to industry dated September 19, 2006.   For instances where there are issues as to validity and/or authorization of grants, we have accounted for such awards as fixed options using as the measurement date the date that we have determined to be the date on which the terms and recipients were established with finality.   For instances where we have difficulty locating documentation to determine precisely the first date on which both the number of shares and exercise prices were known, we have determined measurement dates based upon the documentation available as to when the grants were included in our books and records or using assumptions based on the historical documentation on other grants with similar characteristics. These determinations require significant judgments.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-5,  Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) is indexed to an Entitys Own Stock  (EITF 07-5), which supersedes EITF Issue No. 01-6,  The Meaning of Indexed to a Companys Own Stock . SFAS No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  (SFAS133), specifies that a contract issued or held by a company that is both indexed to its own stock and classified in stockholders equity is not considered a derivative instrument for purposes of applying SFAS 133. EITF 07-5 provides guidance for applying therequirements of SFAS 133, requiring that both an instruments contingent exercise provisions and its settlement provisions be evaluated to determine whether the instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed solely to an entitys own stock. EITF 07-5 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009 for any outstanding or new arrangements. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting EITF 07-5 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.   In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 142-3,  Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets  (FSP FAS142-3), which is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. FSP FAS 142-3 provides guidance on the renewal or extension assumptions used in the determination of the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The intent of FSP FAS 142-3 is to better match the useful life of the recognized intangible asset to the period of the expected cash flows used to measure its fair value. We do not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 to materially impact its consolidated financialposition or results of operations.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),  Business Combinations  (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) changes accounting for acquisitions that close beginning in 2009. More transactions and events will qualify as business combinations and will be accounted for at fair value under the new standard. SFAS 141(R) promotes greater use of fair values in financial reporting. Some of the changes will introduce more volatility into earnings. SFAS 141(R) is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,  The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115  (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 does not affect any existing accounting literaturethat requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value. SFAS 159 does not eliminate disclosure    46      requirements included in other accounting standards, including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in SFAS No. 157,  Fair Value Measurements  (SFAS 157), and SFAS No. 107,  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments . SFAS 159 was effective for us beginning January 1, 2008. We have not elected fair value reporting for eligible items under this standard as of December 31, 2008.   Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Risk Management   Risk is an inherent part of our business. In the course of conducting business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks including market risk, operational risk, and legal, regulatory and compliance risk. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a description of the principal risks to our business. The extent to which we properly identify and effectively manage each of these risks is critical to our financial condition and profitability. Our risk management process consists of regular communications with our operational teams who are charged with managing the risks of our businesses on a daily basis. In addition, numerous individuals from our SeniorManagement Team, including our Chief Executive Officer, are members of our Credit Committee, charged with approving and in certain circumstances monitoring the counterparties of our Transaction Services Division.   Market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may be expected to result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or market prices. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.   Interest Rates   Included in cash and cash equivalents are interest bearing financial instruments in the form of high quality money market funds, short-term commercial paper and short-term treasury securities. Due to the short-term and high quality nature of these instruments, they are not likely to fluctuate significantly in market value.   Our convertible notes are short-term and bear interest at a fixed rate. Consequently, we do not believe we are currently exposed to any material interest rate or market risk in connection with our convertible notes.   Foreign Currency Risk   Our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared with foreign currencies, which are primarily the British pound sterling, Euro and Hong Kong dollar, due to our operations in the United Kingdom, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Our investment and operational activities in these countries expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily between the U.S. dollar and the British Pound Sterling, Euro and Hong Kong dollar. To the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase.We have not engaged in derivative financial instruments as a means of hedging this risk. Non-U.S. dollar cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and required capitalization needs.   Securities Market and Credit Risk   We are subject to risk in our Transaction Services business when a counterparty does not deliver cash or securities to us as expected and we hold cash (in lieu of securities) or securities (in lieu of cash) at any point in time. This risk arises from the potential inability of the counterpartys clearing agent to meet its settlement obligation by delivering cash or securities, as required, which is a credit risk. We are a member of several clearing organizations, which have margin requirements and other mechanisms that are designed to substantially mitigate this risk.   When necessary, we can liquidate or purchase securities in the market to close out the position at the prevailing market price. Our stock lending practice is to maintain collateral in excess of the contract value and to request additional collateral whenever necessary. We seek high-quality, creditworthy counterparties and have controls in place that are designed to monitor and limit this exposure.   In our Transaction Services business we have exposure to changes in the prices of equity securities due to client or our errors. Market risk can arise from liquidating such positions. It is our policy to attempt to    47      trade out of all positions arising from errors immediately upon discovery while balancing our exposure to market risk. If discovery is delayed, the market risk is heightened by the increased possibility of intervening market movements prior to disposition.    48      Item 8.
