Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Recent Developments  — Oil prices declined significantly during the second half of 2014 and have continued to decline in 2015.  The closing price of oil was as high as $105.68 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, as low as $44.08 per barrel in late   21      January 2015 and around $50 per barrel during the first week in February 2015 (WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration).  As a result of the decline in oil prices, our industry is now experiencing a severe downturn.  Market conditions remain very dynamic and are changing quickly.  Although the magnitude as well as the duration of this downturn are not yet known, we believe that 2015 will be a challenging year for our industry.    We believe the vast majority of exploration and production companies, including our customers, have significantly reduced their 2015 capital spending plans.   The initial impact of these spending reductions is evidenced by the published rig counts which have declined more 25% since their recent peak in October 2014.    Our rig count has also declined.  During October 2014, the number of our drilling rigs operating in the United States was as high as 214, and as of February 10, 2015 we had 173 drilling rigs operating in the United States.  We have received indications of customers’ intent to early terminate a number of term contracts and many of our drilling customers are seeking price reductions.  We expect the number of our drilling rigs operating in the United States to decline at least another 20% during the next 90 days.    Our pressure pumping business is also beginning to see the effects of reduced spending by customers.  Some previously scheduled pressure pumping jobs have been cancelled or deferred and many customers are also seeking price reductions.    In anticipation of this downturn, we began reducing our cost structure in the fourth quarter of 2014.  In 2015, we have continued to reduce our cost structure and, to date, we have reduced our drilling headcount at a rate slightly higher than the reduction in our rig count.  We have also reduced our capital expenditure plans for 2015.  Along with other reductions, we now plan to only build new drilling rigs that are currently committed under term contracts.  We plan to continue to adjust our cost structure in line with our level of operating activity.    We expect that our term contract coverage and scalability with respect to labor and other operating costs should position us to weather this downturn.  In the event oil prices remain depressed for a sustained period, or decline further, however, we may experience further, significant declines on both drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing, and on pressure pumping activity and pricing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Management Overview  — We are a leading provider of services to the North American oil and natural gas industry.  Our services primarily involve the drilling, on a contract basis, of land-based oil and natural gas wells and pressure pumping services.  In addition to these services, we also invest, on a non-operating working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.    As of December 31, 2014, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 239 land-based drilling rigs.  There continues to be uncertainty with respect to the global economic environment, and oil and natural gas prices are volatile.  Oil prices declined significantly during the second half of 2014 and have continued to decline in 2015.  The closing price of oil was as high as $105.68 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, as low as $44.08 per barrel in late January 2015 and around $50 per barrel during the first week in February 2015 (WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration).  In response, many of our customers have announced significant reductions in their 2015 capital spending budgets.  During October 2014, the number of our drilling rigs operating in the United States was as high as 214, and as of February 10, 2015 we had 173 drilling rigs operating in the United States.  We expect the number of our drilling rigs operating in the United States to continue to decline at least through the first quarter of 2015.    We have addressed our customers’ needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years.  As of December 31, 2014, we have completed 145 new APEX ®  rigs and made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.  We have plans to complete 16 additional new APEX ®  rigs in 2015.    In connection with horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs.  As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 1.0 million hydraulic horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet.  This is a net increase of approximately 866,000 horsepower since the end of 2009.  In recent years, low natural gas prices and the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.    We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more.  Our backlog as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $1.5 billion.  We expect approximately $953 million of our backlog to be realized in 2015.  We generally calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract.  The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving, on standby or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of   22      what is permitted under the drilling contract.  In addition, generally our term drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.  For contracts for which we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate, for the period we expect to receive the lower rate.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Not Ultimately Be Realized as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.”    For the three years ended December 31, 2014, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):                  2014           2013           2012         Contract drilling       $   1,838,830               58   %       $   1,679,611               62   %       $   1,821,713               67   %     Pressure pumping           1,293,265               41   %           979,166               36   %           841,771               31   %     Oil and natural gas           50,196               1   %           57,257               2   %           59,930               2   %             $   3,182,291               100   %       $   2,716,034               100   %       $   2,723,414               100   %       Generally, the profitability of our business is impacted most by two primary factors in our contract drilling segment: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.  During 2014, our average number of rigs operating was 203 in the United States and 8 in Canada compared to 184 in the United States and 8 in Canada in 2013 and 214 in the United States and 7 in Canada in 2012.  Our average revenue per operating day was $23,880 in 2014 compared to $24,020 in 2013 and $22,540 in 2012.  We had consolidated net income of $163 million for 2014 compared to $188 million for 2013.  This decrease in consolidated net income was due to a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of 55 mechanical drilling rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the now reduced size of our mechanical rig fleet.  Also, revenues in 2013 included early termination revenues totaling approximately $65.2 million related to early contract terminations.    Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.  During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services.  Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.  Oil and natural gas prices and our monthly average number of rigs operating have declined from recent highs.  In December 2014, our average number of rigs operating was 208 in the United States and 8 in Canada.  In January 2015, our average number of rigs operating decreased to 198.    We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  Please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report.    Critical Accounting Policies   In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.  The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.    Property and equipment  — Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.  We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.  Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.  No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.  We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (“triggering events”) indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives.  In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.  The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time.  Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate.  Based on management’s expectations of future trends, we estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment.  These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management’s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.  Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset’s net book value.  Any provision for impairment is measured at fair value.    On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional vertical wells versus drilling longer horizontal wells using high capacity rigs).  The components comprising rigs that will   23      no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.  The remaining components of these rigs are retired.  In 2014, we identified 55 mechanical rigs that we determined would no longer be marketed.  We recorded a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the now reduced size of our mechanical fleet.  In 2013, we identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.  Also, we had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.  Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.  We recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.  In 2012, we identified 36 rigs that it determined would no longer be marketed and recorded a charge of $5.2 million related to the retirement of these rigs.    We also evaluate our fleet of marketable pressure pumping equipment and in 2012 identified approximately 37,000 horsepower of pressure pumping equipment that would be retired.  The net book value of these assets of $7.3 million was expensed in our consolidated statements of operations.  There were no similar charges in 2014 or 2013.    In light of the significant decline in oil and natural gas commodity prices beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing into 2015, we deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.  With respect to these assets, we estimated future cash flows over the expected life of the assets, and determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets.  Based on this assessment, no impairment was indicated.  Impairment considerations related to our oil and natural gas segment are discussed below.    Goodwill  — Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.  We evaluate goodwill at least annually on December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.  For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.  Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be the same as our operating segments.  We currently have goodwill in our contract drilling and pressure pumping operating segments.  We first determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors.  If so, then goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step impairment test.  From time to time, we may perform the first step of quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing a qualitative assessment.  The first step is to compare the fair value of an entity’s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.  If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the shortfall.    We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2013.  In completing the first step of the analysis, we used a three-year projection of discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value determined using the constant growth method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.  In developing this fair value estimate, we applied key assumptions including an assumed discount rate of 11.87% for the contract drilling reporting unit and an assumed discount rate of 12.40% for the pressure pumping reporting unit.  An assumed long-term growth rate of 3.00% was used for both reporting units.  Based on the results of the first step of the impairment test in 2013, we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.    In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2014, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.  In making this determination, we considered the continued demand experienced during 2014 for our services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.  We also considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in these operating segments.  Additionally, operating results for 2014 and forecasted operating results for 2015 were also taken into account.  Our overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of our reporting units over their carrying values from our 2013 quantitative Step 1 assessment of goodwill were also considered.    We have undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade our fleet of equipment and believe that we are well positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells.  In the event that market conditions were to remain weak for a protracted period, we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in our contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.    Revenue recognition  — Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.  Expenditures reimbursed by customers are recognized as revenue and the related expenses are recognized as direct costs.  All of the wells we drilled in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were drilled under daywork contracts.    24      Use of estimates  — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from such estimates.    Key estimates used by management include:       ·   allowance for doubtful accounts,       ·   depreciation, depletion and amortization,       ·   fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions,       ·   goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and       ·   reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.    Oil and natural gas properties  — Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.  Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.  Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.  Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.  We review wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.  If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, we consider the well costs to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense.  Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties, are charged to expense when incurred.  The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved developed oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.  Oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.    We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.  Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on our expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.  These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.  If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and fair value.  The fair value estimates used in measuring impairment are based on internally developed unobservable inputs including reserve volumes and future production, pricing and operating costs (level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting).  The expected future net cash flows are discounted using an annual rate of 10% to determine fair value.  We review unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.  Our impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as our intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.  If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.  Impairment expense related to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties totaled approximately $20.9 million, $4.0 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is included in depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.    For additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.    Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our liquidity as of December 31, 2014 included approximately $341 million in working capital and approximately $157 million available under our $500 million revolving credit facility.  Subsequent to December 31, 2014, we received an $82 million federal income tax refund related to 2014.  The refund, along with other cash generated from our cash management efforts, were used to repay $103 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility during 2015.  As of February 10, 2015, availability under the revolving credit facility was $260 million.  In an attempt to further increase availability under our revolving credit facility, we are working with a lender to move $39.8 million of letters of credit currently outstanding under our revolving credit facility into a new separate facility to be used only for letters of credit.    We believe our current liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to build new equipment, make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends.  If under current market conditions we desire to pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would   25      likely require additional debt or equity financing.  However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.   As of December 31, 2014, we had working capital of $341 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $43 million, compared to working capital of $454 million and cash and cash equivalents of $250 million at December 31, 2013.    During 2014, our sources of cash flow included:       ·   $729 million from operating activities,       ·   $303 million in net borrowings under our revolving credit facility,      ·   $39.6 million from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, and       ·   $33.2 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.    During 2014, we used $176 million to acquire pressure pumping operations, $58.3 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $13.6 million to repurchase shares of our common stock, $10.0 million to repay long-term debt and $1.1 billion:       ·   to build new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment,       ·   to make capital expenditures for the betterment and refurbishment of our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment,       ·   to acquire and procure equipment and facilities for our drilling and pressure pumping operations, and       ·   to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a working interest basis.    We paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2014 as follows:                  Per Share           Total                                 (in thousands)         Paid on March 27, 2014       $   0.10           $   14,456         Paid on June 26, 2014           0.10               14,562         Paid on September 24, 2014           0.10               14,634         Paid on December 24, 2014           0.10               14,636         Total cash dividends       $   0.40           $   58,288           On February 4, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.10 per share to be paid on March 25, 2015 to holders of record as of March 11, 2015.  The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our credit facilities and other factors.    On August 1, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program authorizing purchases of up to $250 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.  On July 25, 2012, our Board of Directors terminated the remaining authority under the 2007 stock buyback program, and approved a new stock buyback program authorizing purchases of up to $150 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.  On September 6, 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors terminated any remaining authority under the 2012 stock buyback program, and approved a new stock buyback program that authorizes purchase of up to $200 million of the Company’s common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.  As of December 31, 2014, we had remaining authorization to purchase approximately $187 million of our outstanding common stock under the new stock buyback program.  Shares purchased under a buyback program are accounted for as treasury stock.    We acquired shares of stock from employees during 2014, 2013 and 2012 that are accounted for as treasury stock.  Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees.  The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll tax withholding obligations upon the exercise of stock options, the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock.  These shares were acquired at fair market value.  These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.  2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”) or the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.  2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and not pursuant to the stock buyback program.    26      Treasury stock acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

38,146,738           $   795,051           On September 27, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”).  The Credit Agreement is a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility.  The Credit Agreement replaced a previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility.    The revolving credit facility permits aggregate borrowings of up to $500 million outstanding at any time.  The revolving credit facility contains a letter of credit facility that is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that is limited to $40 million, in each case outstanding at any time.    The term loan facility provides for a loan of $100 million, which was drawn on December 24, 2012.  The term loan facility is payable in quarterly principal installments which commenced December 27, 2012.  The installment amounts vary from 1.25% of the original principal amount for each of the first four quarterly installments, 2.50% of the original principal amount for each of the subsequent eight quarterly installments, 5.00% of the original principal amount for the subsequent four quarterly installments and 13.75% of the original principal amount for the final four quarterly installments.    Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders’ aggregate commitments with respect to the revolving credit facility and/or the term loan facility be increased by up to $100 million, not to exceed total commitments of $700 million.  The maturity date under the Credit Agreement is September 27, 2017 for both the revolving facility and the term facility.    Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate.  The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 2.25% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 1.25% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio.  As of December 31, 2014, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 2.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.  Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2014, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2015.  A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit.  The commitment fee rate payable to the lenders for the unused portion of the credit facility is 0.50%.    Each of our U.S. subsidiaries, other than one domestic holding company and certain immaterial subsidiaries, has unconditionally guaranteed all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the other guarantors and us arising under the Credit Agreement and other loan documents.  Such guarantees also cover obligations of us and any of our subsidiaries arising under any interest rate swap contract with any person while such person is a lender or an affiliate of a lender under the Credit Agreement.    The Credit Agreement requires compliance with two financial covenants.  We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 45%.  The Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.  We also must not permit the interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00.  The Credit Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period.  We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2014.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants.  We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.    Events of default under the Credit Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, as well as a cross default event, loan document enforceability event, change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.  If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then a majority of the lenders have the right, among others, to (i) terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement, (ii) accelerate and require us to repay all the outstanding   27      amounts owed under any loan document (provided that in limited circumstances with respect to insolvency and bankruptcy such acceleration is automatic), and (iii) require us to cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit.    As of December 31, 2014, we had $82.5 million principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility at an interest rate of 2.50% and $303 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at a weighted interest rate of 2.65%.  We had $39.8 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2014 and, as a result, had available borrowing capacity of approximately $157 million at that date.    On October 5, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 5, 2020 (the “Series A Notes”) in a private placement.  The Series A Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.97% per annum.  We will pay interest on the Series A Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year.  The Series A Notes will mature on October 5, 2020.    On June 14, 2012, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amounts of our 4.27% Series B Senior Notes due June 14, 2022 (the “Series B Notes”) in a private placement.  The Series B Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.27% per annum.  We will pay interest on the Series B Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year.  The Series B Notes will mature on June 14, 2022.    The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are our senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsubordinated indebtedness.  The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our existing domestic subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries.    The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are prepayable at our option, in whole or in part, provided that in the case of a partial prepayment, prepayment must be in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, at any time and from time to time at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date, plus a “make-whole” premium as specified in the note purchase agreements.  We must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of any change of control.  In addition, we must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions if the proceeds therefrom are not timely reinvested in productive assets.  If any offer to prepay is accepted, the purchase price of each prepaid note is 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the prepayment date.    The respective note purchase agreements require compliance with two financial covenants.  We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 50% at any time.  The note purchase agreements generally define the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.  We also must not permit the interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.00.  The note purchase agreements generally define the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA for the four prior quarters to interest charges for the same period.  We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2014.  We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.    Events of default under the note purchase agreements include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, a cross default event, a judgment in excess of a threshold event, the guaranty agreement ceasing to be enforceable, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, a change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.  If an event of default under the note purchase agreements occurs and is continuing, then holders of a majority in principal amount of the respective notes have the right to declare all the notes then-outstanding to be immediately due and payable.  In addition, if the Company defaults in payments on any note, then until such defaults are cured, the holder thereof may declare all the notes held by it pursuant to the note purchase agreement to be immediately due and payable.    Commitments and Contingencies  — As of December 31, 2014, we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $39.8 million for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which could become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts.  These letters of credit expire annually at various times during the year and are typically renewed.  As of December 31, 2014, no amounts had been drawn under the letters of credit.    As of December 31, 2014, we had commitments to purchase approximately $512 million of major equipment for our drilling and pressure pumping businesses.    Our pressure pumping business has entered into agreements to purchase minimum quantities of proppants and chemicals from certain vendors.  These agreements expire in 2016, 2017 and 2018.  As of December 31, 2014, the remaining obligation under these agreements was approximately $71.8 million, of which materials with a total purchase price of approximately $15.4 million were   28      required to be purchased during 2015.  In the event that the required minimum quantities are not purchased during any contract year, we could be required to make a liquidated damages payment to the respective vendor for any shortfall.    In November 2011, our pressure pumping business entered into an agreement with a proppant vendor to advance up to $12.0 million to such vendor to finance its construction of certain processing facilities.  This advance is secured by the underlying processing facilities and bears interest at an annual rate of 5.0%.  Repayment of the advance is to be made through discounts applied to purchases from the vendor and repayment of all amounts advanced must be made no later than October 1, 2017.  As of December 31, 2014, advances of approximately $11.8 million had been made under this agreement and repayments of approximately $8.6 million had been received resulting in a balance outstanding of approximately $3.2 million.    In May 2013, the EEOC notified us of cause findings related to certain of our employment practices.  The cause findings relate to allegations that we tolerated a hostile work environment for employees based on national origin and race.  The cause findings also allege, among other things, failure to promote, subjecting employees to adverse employment terms and conditions and retaliation.  We and the EEOC engaged in the statutory conciliation process.  In March 2014, the EEOC notified us that this matter will be forwarded to its legal unit for litigation review.  In November 2014, we and the EEOC participated in a mediation to resolve the matter.  Discussions are ongoing.  If no resolution is reached, we believe that litigation will ensue, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.  Based on the information available to us at this time, we do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of this matter.    In October 2014, we were notified by EPA Region 6 that it intends to seek civil penalties for alleged RCRA violations at a former facility on one of our subsidiaries in Midland, Texas.  The EPA subsequently alleged RCRA violations at other facilities of that subsidiary and are seeking an aggregate monetary penalty of approximately $1.1 million.  We are in negotiations with the EPA regarding the scope and amount of any potential settlement.  We do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Trading and Investing  — We have not engaged in trading activities that include high-risk securities, such as derivatives and non-exchange traded contracts.  We invest cash primarily in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits and money market accounts.    29      Contractual Obligations   The following table presents information with respect to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):                  Payments due by period                 Total           Less than 1 year           1-3 years           3-5 years           More than 5 years         Term loan (1)       $   82,500           $   12,500           $   70,000           $   —           $   —         Interest on term loan (2)           4,082               1,992               2,090               —               —         Revolving credit (3)           303,000               —               303,000               —               —         Interest on revolving credit (4)           22,280               8,132               14,148               —               —         Series A Notes (5)           300,000               —               —               —               300,000         Interest on Series A Notes (6)           85,940               14,910               29,820               29,820               11,390         Series B Notes (7)           300,000               —               —               —               300,000         Interest on Series B Notes (8)           95,506               12,810               25,620               25,620               31,456         Leases (9)           34,882               14,554               12,269               4,472               3,587         Equipment purchases (10)           511,819               511,819               —               —               —         Inventory purchases (11)           71,774               15,441               39,833               16,500               —                 $   1,811,783           $   592,158           $   496,780           $   76,412           $   646,433            (1)   Represents repayments of borrowings under the term loan portion of the Credit Agreement.  The term loan matures on September 27, 2017.        (2)   Interest to be paid on term loan using 2.50% rate in effect as of December 31, 2014.

Revenues and direct operating costs increased in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of an increase in the number of rigs operating.  Revenues in 2013 included approximately $65.2 million of early termination revenues.  Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2013 due to the early termination revenue.  Capital expenditures were incurred in 2014 and 2013 to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade existing drilling rigs and to acquire additional equipment including top drives, drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.  In 2014, we identified 55 mechanical rigs that we determined would no longer be marketed.  We recorded additional depreciation, amortization and impairment expense of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the now reduced size of our mechanical fleet.  In 2013, we identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.  Also, we had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.  Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.  We recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.  Significant capital expenditures incurred in recent years to add new rig capacity also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense.    31                     Year Ended December 31,         Pressure Pumping       2014           2013           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   1,293,265           $   979,166               32.1   %     Direct operating costs           1,036,310               744,243               39.2   %     Margin (1)           256,955               234,923               9.4   %     Selling, general and administrative           20,279               17,695               14.6   %     Depreciation, amortization and impairment           147,595               129,984               13.5   %     Operating income       $   89,081           $   87,244               2.1   %     Fracturing jobs           1,224               1,261               (2.9   )%     Other jobs           4,253               4,800               (11.4   )%     Total jobs           5,477               6,061               (9.6   )%     Average revenue per fracturing job       $   991.89           $   705.57               40.6   %     Average revenue per other job       $   18.62           $   18.63               (0.1   )%     Average revenue per total job       $   236.13           $   161.55               46.2   %     Average direct operating costs per total job       $   189.21           $   122.79               54.1   %     Average margin per total job (1)       $   46.92           $   38.76               21.1   %     Margin as a percentage of total revenues (1)           19.9   %           24.0   %           (17.1   )%     Capital expenditures       $   241,359           $   122,782               96.6   %           (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.  Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs.  Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues.    Revenues and direct operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in the size of our jobs and the size of our pressure pumping fleet.  Our customers have continued the development of unconventional reservoirs resulting in an increase in larger multi-stage fracturing jobs associated therewith.  In connection with the horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs, including the June 2014 acquisition of an East Texas-based pressure pumping operation and the October 2014 acquisition of a Texas-based pressure pumping operation.  As a result, we have continued to experience an increase in the number of these larger multi-stage fracturing jobs as a proportion of the total fracturing jobs we performed.  Additionally, the average size of the multi-stage fracturing jobs has increased.  Average revenue per fracturing job and average direct operating costs per total job increased as a result of this increase in the proportion of larger multi-stage fracturing jobs and the increased size of the jobs in 2014 as compared to 2013.  Depreciation expense increased due to capital expenditures.                   Year Ended December 31,         Oil and Natural Gas Production and Exploration       2014           2013           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands, except commodity prices)         Revenues -

Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days.    The demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of oil and natural gas.  The reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years contributed to an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand.  Customer demand shifted away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, reducing the utilization rates of our mechanically powered drilling rigs.  The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2013 and 2012 follows:                  1 st           2 nd           3 rd           4 th                                 Quarter           Quarter           Quarter           Quarter           Year         2012:                                                                                     Average oil price per Bbl (1)       $   102.88           $   93.42           $   92.24           $   87.96           $   94.12         Average natural gas price per Mcf (2)       $   2.45           $   2.28           $   2.88           $   3.40           $   2.75         2013:                                                                                     Average oil price per Bbl (1)       $   94.34           $   94.10           $   105.84           $   97.34           $   97.91         Average natural gas price per Mcf (2)       $   3.49           $   4.01           $   3.55           $   3.85           $   3.73                (1)   The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.    33          (2)   The average natural gas price represents the average monthly Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.    Revenues and direct operating costs decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of a decrease in the number of rigs operating.  A greater proportion of our high specification APEX ®  rigs working combined with early contract termination revenues caused an increase in the average revenue per operating day.  Capital expenditures were incurred in 2013 and 2012 to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade existing drilling rigs and to acquire additional equipment including top drives, drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.  In 2013, we identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.  Also, we had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.  Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.  We recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.  In 2012, we identified 36 rigs that we determined would no longer be marketed and recorded additional depreciation, amortization and impairment expense of $5.2 million related to the retirement of these rigs.  Significant capital expenditures incurred in recent years to add new rig capacity also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense.                   Year Ended December 31,         Pressure Pumping       2013           2012           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   979,166           $   841,771               16.3   %     Direct operating costs           744,243               580,878               28.1   %     Margin (1)           234,923               260,893               (10.0   )%     Selling, general and administrative           17,695               17,036               3.9   %     Depreciation, amortization and impairment           129,984               111,062               17.0   %     Operating income       $   87,244           $   132,795               (34.3   )%     Fracturing jobs           1,261               1,229               2.6   %     Other jobs           4,800               5,659               (15.2   )%     Total jobs           6,061               6,888               (12.0   )%     Average revenue per fracturing job       $   705.57           $   590.70               19.4   %     Average revenue per other job       $   18.63           $   20.46               (8.9   )%     Average revenue per total job       $   161.55           $   122.21               32.2   %     Average direct operating costs per total job       $   122.79           $   84.33               45.6   %     Average margin per total job (1)       $   38.76           $   37.88               2.3   %     Margin as a percentage of revenues (1)           24.0   %           31.0   %           (22.6   )%     Capital expenditures       $   122,782           $   194,117               (36.7   )%           (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.  Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs.  Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues.    In connection with the development of unconventional reservoirs, customers continued to increase the average size of the fracturing jobs.  As a result, we experienced an increase in the size of these multi-stage fracturing jobs resulting in higher revenues and costs.  Average revenue per fracturing job increased as a result of this increase in the larger multi-stage fracturing jobs in 2013 as compared to 2012.  Average direct operating costs per total job increased primarily as a result of increased amounts of materials and labor used on the larger multi-stage fracturing jobs.  Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense increased in 2013 due primarily to significant capital expenditures incurred to add capacity.  In 2012, depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses included approximately $7.3 million related to the retirement of certain pressure pumping equipment.  There were no comparable charges in 2013.    34                     Year Ended December 31,         Oil and Natural Gas Production and Exploration       2013           2012           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands, except commodity prices)         Revenues -

We present Adjusted EBITDA (a non-U.S. GAAP measure) because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to both the performance of our fundamental business activities and our ability to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measures of net income or operating cash flow.                   Year Ended December 31,                 2014           2013           2012                 (Dollars in thousands)         Net income       $   162,664           $   188,009           $   299,477         Income tax expense           91,619               108,432               176,196         Net interest expense           28,846               27,441               22,196         Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment           718,730               597,469               526,614         Adjusted EBITDA       $   1,001,859           $   921,351           $   1,024,483        35            Income Taxes                  Year Ended December 31,                 2014           2013           2012                 (Dollars in thousands)         Income before income taxes       $   254,283           $   296,441           $   475,673         Income tax expense       $   91,619           $   108,432           $   176,196         Effective tax rate           36.0   %           36.6   %           37.0   %        The effective tax rate is a result of a federal rate of 35.0% adjusted as follows:                 2014           2013           2012         Statutory tax rate           35.0   %           35.0   %           35.0   %     State income taxes           2.5               3.7               2.5         Permanent differences           (1.4   )           (1.5   )           (0.2   )     Other, net           (0.1   )           (0.6   )           (0.3   )     Effective tax rate           36.0   %           36.6   %           37.0   %       The Domestic Production Activities Deduction was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and allows a deduction of 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.  The permanent difference for 2012 does not include any deduction as it is limited to taxable income and we did not have taxable income in 2012 due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.  The permanent difference for 2013 includes a deduction of $10.0 million as we fully utilized our remaining net operating loss carryforwards.  The permanent difference for 2014 includes a deduction of $8.8 million.    We record deferred federal income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled.  As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized.  We recognized deferred tax expense of approximately $44 million in 2014, $51 million in 2013 and $160 million in 2012.    On January 1, 2010, we converted our Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for federal income tax purposes.  Because the statutory tax rates in Canada are lower than those in the United States, this transaction triggered a $5.1 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as a reduction to deferred income tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.    As a result of the above conversion, our Canadian assets are no longer directly subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.  Effective January 1, 2010, we have elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intend to do so for the foreseeable future.  As a result, no deferred United States federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $47.5 million as of December 31, 2014.  The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings was approximately $7.2 million, net of available foreign tax credits.  This liability would be recognized if we received a dividend of the unremitted earnings.    Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impact on Operations and Financial Condition   Our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.  For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.  Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control.  Please see “Risk Factors – We are Dependent on the Oil and Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.  Declines in Customers’ Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results” in Item 1A of this Report.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, oil prices averaged $99.96 per barrel, natural gas prices averaged $4.59 per Mcf and demand for drilling activities increased.  During the three months ended December 31, 2014, drilling activity slowed as oil prices averaged $73.16 per barrel and natural gas prices averaged $3.80 per Mcf.  Drilling activity has significantly decreased since December 31, 2014, as oil prices averaged $47.22 per barrel and natural gas prices averaged $2.99 per Mcf during January 2015.  Our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and given current oil pricing and existing market trends, we expect our average number of rigs operating to continue to decline through at least the first quarter of 2015.      36      We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.  Continued low market prices for oil and natural gas will likely result in decreased demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.  Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services.    Impact of Inflation   Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2014.  We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the recognition of revenue from customers.  Under this guidance, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.  This guidance also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty, if any, of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.    In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period.  The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition.  The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.          Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We currently have exposure to interest rate market risk associated with any borrowings that we have under our term credit facility or our revolving credit facility.  Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.  The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.25% to 3.25% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.25%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.  At December 31, 2014, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.25% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.  Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2014, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2015.  As of December 31, 2014, we had $303 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted interest rate of 2.65% and $82.5 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 2.50%.  The interest rate on the borrowing outstanding under our term credit facility is variable and adjusts at each interest payment date based on our election of LIBOR or the base rate.  A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term credit facility as of December 31, 2014 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $3.8 million.    We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations.  The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.  If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.  This currency risk is not material to our results of operations or financial condition.    The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.          Item 8.
