ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS.       This Item 7 contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.       Commitments and Contingencies -- We have no commitments or contingencies which would require further disclosure in our financial statements other than letters of credit totaling $25.5 million at December 31, 2002, maintained for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which would become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts. No amounts have been drawn under the letters of credit.       Net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes a charge of $4.7 million related to the financial failure in 2002 of a workers' compensation insurance carrier that had provided coverage for the Company in prior years.       Trading and investing -- We have not engaged in trading activities that include high-risk securities, such as derivatives and non-exchange traded contracts. We invest cash primarily in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits, money markets, and highly rated municipal and commercial bonds. However in June 2002 and October 2002, we acquired a total of 1,058,673 shares of common stock of TMBR/Sharp Drilling, Inc., a company whose stock is traded on the NASDAQ National Market System, for a total of $17.7 million.       Description of business -- We are a leading provider of land-based contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas operators in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Utah, and Western Canada. As of December 31, 2002, we owned 324 drilling rigs. We provide drilling fluids, completion fluids, and related services to oil and natural gas operators in West Texas, Southeast New Mexico, South Texas, East Texas, Oklahoma, the Gulf Coast regions of Texas and Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling and completion fluids are used by oil and natural gas operators during the drilling process to control pressure when drilling oil and natural gas wells. We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators in the Appalachian Basin. These services consist primarily of well stimulation and cementing for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells. We are also engaged in the development,                                          19   exploration, acquisition, and production of oil and natural gas. Our oil and natural gas operations are focused in producing regions in West Texas, Southeast New Mexico, and South Texas.       The contract drilling business experienced increased demand for drilling services from 1995 through most of 1997 and from mid-1999 through the second quarter of 2001. However, except for those periods and other occasional upturns, generally, there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand in most operational and geographic segments of the North American land drilling industry. As a result, drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins.       In addition to adverse effects that future declines in demand could have on Patterson-UTI, ongoing factors which could adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:       - movement of drilling rigs from region to region,       - reactivation of land-based drilling rigs, or       - new construction of drilling rigs.       We cannot predict either the future level of demand for our contract drilling services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling business.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, oil and natural gas properties, impairment, revenue recognition, and the use of estimates.       Property and equipment -- Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment. We review our assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain assets either exceed their respective fair values or may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives. Provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset's net book value. Impairment charges are recorded based on discounted cash flows. There were no impairment charges during the years 2002, 2001 or 2000.       Oil and natural gas properties -- We follow the successful efforts method of accounting, using the field as the accumulation center, for our oil and natural gas properties. Exploration and development costs which result directly in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized. Exploration costs which do not result directly in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense. Capitalized costs, consisting of lease and well equipment, lease acquisition costs, and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted, and amortized on the units-of-production method, based on petroleum engineer estimates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves of each respective field. Impairment of proved oil and natural gas properties is periodically assessed based on estimated future net cash flows at a field level as determined by an independent reserve engineer. Impairment expense is included in depreciation, depletion, and amortization in the accompanying financial statements.       Revenue recognition -- Generally, revenues are recognized when services are performed. The Company follows the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for footage contract drilling arrangements. Under this method, drilling revenues and costs related to a well in progress are recognized proportionately over the time it takes to drill the well. Due to the nature of turnkey contract drilling arrangements and risks therein, the Company follows the completed contract method of accounting for such arrangements. Under this method, all drilling advances and costs (including maintenance and repairs) related to a well in progress are deferred and                                          20   recognized as revenues and expenses in the period the well is completed. Provisions for losses on incomplete or in-process wells are made when estimated total costs are expected to exceed estimated total revenues.       Use of estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from such estimates.       Key estimates used by management include:       - allowance for doubtful accounts,       - depreciation, depletion, and amortization,       - asset impairment,       - reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverages, and       - fair values of assets and liabilities assumed.       For additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.       Related party transactions --  In 2001 and 2000, we leased a 1981 Beech King-Air 90 airplane owned by SSI Oil and Gas, Inc., an entity beneficially owned 50% by Cloyce A. Talbott, Patterson-UTI's Chief Executive Officer, and directly owned 50% by A. Glenn Patterson, Patterson-UTI's President/Chief Operating Officer. Under the terms of the lease, we paid a monthly rental of $9,200, the costs of fuel, insurance, taxes, and maintenance of the aircraft. Such amounts totaled approximately $212,000 and $194,000 for 2001 and 2000, respectively.       The Company operates certain oil and natural gas properties in which certain of our affiliated persons have participated, either individually or through entities they control, in the prospects or properties in which we have an interest. These participations, which have been on a working interest basis, have been in prospects or properties originated or acquired by Patterson-UTI. At December 31, 2002, affiliated persons were working interest owners in 215 of the 256 wells then being operated by Patterson-UTI. Sales of working interests are made by Patterson-UTI to reduce its economic risk in the properties. Generally, it is more efficient for Patterson-UTI to sell the working interests to these affiliated persons than to market them to unrelated third parties. Sales were made by Patterson-UTI at its cost, comprised of Patterson-UTI's costs of acquiring and preparing the working interests for sale. These costs were paid by the working interest owners on a pro rata basis based upon their working interest ownership percentage. The price at which working interests were sold to affiliated persons was the same price at which working interests were sold to unaffiliated persons.                                          21        The following table sets forth production revenues received and joint interest billings paid by each of the affiliated persons during 2002 for all wells operated by Patterson-UTI in which they have working interests. These numbers do not necessarily represent their profits or losses from these interests because the joint interest billings do not include the parties' related drilling and leasehold acquisition costs incurred prior to January 1, 2002.

(8) Revenues included in IDC Enterprises, Ltd. revenues.                                          22        In 2002 and 2001, we paid approximately $279,000 and $387,000, respectively, to TMP Truck and Trailer LP ("TMP"), an entity owned by Thomas M. Patterson (son of A. Glenn Patterson), for certain equipment and metal fabrication services. Purchases from TMP were at then current market prices.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       As of December 31, 2002, we had working capital of approximately $167.9 million including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $82.2 million. For 2002, our significant sources of cash flow were:       - $131.4 million derived from operations,       - $15.7 million from the exercise of stock options and warrants, and       - $1.8 million from the sale of certain property and equipment.       Correspondingly, we used approximately $17.7 million to acquire 1,058,673 common shares of TMBR/Sharp Drilling, Inc. (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of Item 8 to this Report), and approximately $83.8 million:       - to make capital expenditures for the betterment and refurbishment of our        drilling rigs,       - for the acquisition and procurement of drilling equipment,       - to fund capital expenditures for our drilling and completion fluids and        pressure pumping divisions, and       - to fund leasehold acquisition and development and exploration of oil and        natural gas properties.       On March 21, 2002, we acquired five SCR electric land-based drilling rigs from Odin Drilling, Inc., increasing our land-based drilling fleet to 324. The purchase price of $16.9 million consisted of 650,000 shares of our common stock valued at $26.06 per share. A deferred tax liability of $4.1 million was recorded as a result of the transaction. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the related purchase price was allocated among the rigs based on their estimated fair values.       Subsequent to December 31, 2002, the Company purchased seven drilling rigs, in two separate transactions, for an aggregate purchase price of $16.5 million in cash. The acquisitions were funded out of the Company's existing cash.       We believe that the current level of cash and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet our capital needs. From time to time, acquisition opportunities are reviewed relating to our business. The timing, size or success of any acquisition and the associated capital commitments are unpredictable. Over the longer term, should further opportunities for growth requiring capital arise, we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash generated from operations, and either debt or equity financing. However, there can be no assurance that such capital would be available.                                          23   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001       The following tables summarize operations by business segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001:                                                               YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                                         ------------------------------ CONTRACT DRILLING                                         2002       2001     % CHANGE - -----------------                                       --------   --------   --------                                                               (DOLLARS IN 000'S)        Revenues..............................................  $410,295   $839,931    (51.2)% Direct operating costs................................  $318,201   $487,343    (34.7)% Selling, general, and administrative..................  $  3,987   $  5,277    (24.4)% Depreciation and amortization.........................  $ 80,500   $ 72,797     10.6% Operating income......................................  $  7,607   $274,514    (97.2)% Operating days........................................    45,919     76,871    (40.3)% Average revenue per operating day.....................  $   8.94   $  10.93    (18.2)% Average direct operating cost per operating day.......  $   6.93   $   6.34      9.3% Average margin per operating day......................  $   2.01   $   4.59    (56.2)% Number of owned rigs at end of period.................       324        319      1.6% Average number of rigs owned during period............       323        302      7.0% Average rigs operating................................       126        211    (40.3)% Rig utilization percentage............................        39%        70%   (44.3)% Capital expenditures..................................  $ 64,821   $150,788    (57.0)%        The following table illustrates the average market price of natural gas and our average rigs operating for each of the fiscal quarters in 2002 and 2001:                                                            1ST       2ND       3RD       4TH                                                       QUARTER   QUARTER   QUARTER   QUARTER                                                       -------   -------   -------   -------          2002: Average natural gas price...........................   $2.51     $3.41     $3.20     $4.31 Average rigs operating..............................     117       119       127       140 2001: Average natural gas price...........................   $6.23     $4.41     $2.78     $2.70 Average rigs operating..............................     231       248       225       140        Our rig count began to decline in the third quarter of 2001 and continued until March 2002 when our rig count bottomed at 103 rigs (90 rigs in the U.S. and 13 rigs in Canada). The deterioration in our rig count was primarily the result of weakening natural gas prices through mid-February 2002. Natural gas prices then rebounded somewhat and our rig count improved marginally during the period from March through September 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2002, consistent with improved natural gas prices, our rig count continued to improve and averaged 140 rigs (132 rigs in the U.S. and 8 rigs in Canada).       The decreased operating results in 2002 were reflective of a significant decline in demand for our contract drilling services as evidenced by decreases in the number of operating days and average rig utilization. Increased competition during 2002 for available jobs resulted in downward pricing pressure and decreased operating revenues. Increased operating costs were primarily attributable to increased labor costs, including payroll expenses and workers' compensation insurance costs. Payroll expenses increased as experienced field personnel were retained despite the significant decline in our average rig utilization. Management believes this strategy is beneficial as it (1) retains experienced personnel and (2) facilitates the Company's response to increased demand levels as industry conditions improve. General and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of reduced incentive compensation in 2002. Depreciation and amortization increased in                                          24   2002 primarily as a result of (1) significant capital expenditures in 2001 and 2002 to maintain, modify, and refurbish our drilling fleet and (2) our acquisition of drilling rigs and related equipment from Cleere Drilling Company in December 2001.

Operating expenses per job increased despite reduced activity levels due to a portion of the segment's operating expenses being fixed in nature. The 8.7% decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense is primarily the result of reduced employee incentive compensation in 2002.

Expansion of our pressure pumping services in 2001 and 2002 into the Appalachian regions of Kentucky and West Virginia resulted in increased depreciation and selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2002. The increase in average revenue per job was attributable to the change in the composition of operating revenues. Cementing revenue as a percent of total operating revenue increased from 34.2% in 2001 to 55.6% in 2002 and fracturing revenue as a percent of total operating revenue decreased from 46.7% in 2001 to 39.6% in 2002. Cementing jobs, as compared to fracturing jobs, typically generate greater revenues as the services being provided are much more extensive, requiring us to incur increased operating and material costs. Additionally, operating costs per job increased in 2002 since a portion of direct operating costs remain constant despite fluctuating activity levels.                                          25                                                                 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND                        ---------------------------- EXPLORATION                                                2002      2001     % CHANGE - ----------------------------------                        -------   -------   --------                                                                (DOLLARS IN 000'S)        Revenues................................................  $14,723   $15,988      (7.9)% Direct operating costs..................................  $ 3,956   $ 5,190     (23.8)% Selling, general, and administrative....................  $ 1,571   $ 1,537       2.2% Depreciation and depletion..............................  $ 5,251   $ 8,505     (38.3)% Operating income........................................  $ 3,945   $   756     421.8% Capital expenditures....................................  $ 6,357   $ 7,956     (28.3)% Average net daily oil production (Bbls).................      794       739       7.4% Average net daily gas production (Mcf)..................    5,109     4,654       9.8% Average oil sales price (per Bbl).......................  $ 25.02   $ 24.88       0.6% Average gas sales price (per Mcf).......................  $  2.91   $  4.12     (29.4)%        Decreased revenues are attributable to lower average prices received from sales of natural gas.

Largely due to favorable commodity prices during the first half of 2001, the demand for our contract drilling services was strong as we reached our peak rig utilization of 81% in July. However, beginning in the third quarter of 2001 the industry conditions began to deteriorate as the commodity prices of oil and natural gas significantly weakened. Market prices for oil fell from approximately $27 per barrel at the end of 2000 to approximately $17 per barrel in late 2001 and natural gas prices declined from approximately $10 per Mcf to under $3 per Mcf for the same time period. Accordingly, the demand for our contract drilling services was negatively impacted.

Net operating losses were fully utilized in 2001 and our remaining alternative minimum tax credit of $602,000 may be carried forward indefinitely. Other deferred tax assets consist primarily of various allowance accounts and tax deferred expenses expected to generate a future tax benefit of approximately $12.9 million.       Our effective income tax rate for 2002 includes 38% applicable to our statutory Federal and state income tax rates and approximately 6% attributable to permanent differences. The significance of the impact of the permanent differences to our effective income tax rate in 2002 was largely attributable to our reduced 2002 pretax earnings.       We record non-cash deferred Federal income taxes based primarily on the relationship between the amount of our unused Federal NOL carryforwards and the temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis in our assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled. As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized. We incurred deferred income tax expense of approximately $23.5 million, $14.6 million, and $15.9 million for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.  VOLATILITY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES       Our revenue, profitability, and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas, with respect to all of our operating segments. Historically, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile. Prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as actions of state and local agencies, the United States and foreign governments, and international cartels. All of these are beyond our control. Any significant or extended decline in oil and/or natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.       The contract drilling business experienced increased demand for drilling services from 1995 through most of 1997 and from mid-1999 and continued through the second quarter of 2001. However, except for those                                          29   periods and other occasional upturns, generally, there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand in most operational and geographic segments of the North American land drilling industry. As a result, drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins.  IMPACT OF INFLATION       We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.  RECENTLY-ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS       The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," ("SFAS No. 142") in June 2001. SFAS No. 142 supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, goodwill amortization totaled approximately $4.7 million each year.       The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("SFAS No. 143") in July 2001. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. The provisions of SFAS No. 143, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2003, will result in the Company recording a liability of approximately $1.1 million for estimated costs to be incurred in connection with the abandonment of oil and natural gas properties in the future. In addition, the cumulative effect of this change in accounting policy, which will be recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the first quarter of 2003, will total approximately $500,000, net of tax.       The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," ("SFAS No. 144") in August 2001. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121 and APB Opinion No. 30. The provisions of SFAS No. 144, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2002, did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.       The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," ("SFAS No. 145") in April 2002. SFAS No. 145 amends existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The provisions of SFAS No. 145, which the Company adopted in 2002, did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.       The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," ("SFAS No. 146") in June 2002. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       We currently have no exposure to interest rate market risk as we have no outstanding balance under our credit facility. Should we incur a balance in the future, we would have exposure associated with the floating rate of the interest charged on that balance. The revolving credit facility calls for periodic interest payments at a floating rate ranging from LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.75%. The applicable rate above LIBOR (1.75% at December 31, 2002) is based upon our trailing twelve-month EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense). Our exposure to interest rate risk due to changes in LIBOR is not expected to be material.       We conduct some business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations. The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years. If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be                                          30   reduced when they are translated to U.S. dollars. Also, the value of our Canadian net assets in U.S. dollars may decline.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
