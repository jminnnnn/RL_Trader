This Item 7 contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, without limitation, statements relating to liquidity, financing of operations, continued volatility of oil and natural gas prices, source and sufficiency of funds required for capital needs and additional rig acquisitions (if further opportunities arise), future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, impact of inflation on the                                        17    18  Company's financial position and on the Company's earnings per share, and other such matters. The words "believes," "budgeted," "expects" or "estimates" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's disclosures under the heading: "Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the 'Safe Harbor' Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995" beginning on page 13.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       As of December 31, 1998, the Company had working capital of approximately $31.0 million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9.0 million as compared to working capital of approximately $46.5 million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $23.3 million as of December 31, 1997. The decrease in the Company's working capital at December 31, 1998 was largely attributable to cash expended by the Company related to acquisitions completed during fiscal year 1998. Approximately $8.7 million of the aggregate $58.8 million purchase price for the related acquisitions was funded using cash on hand at the respective dates of acquisition. In addition, the Company assumed approximately $3.4 million of debt, which was paid in full using cash on hand immediately following the consummation of such acquisitions and made an $8.0 million payment to the Internal Revenue Service for the Company's estimated Federal tax liability. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company generated net cash from operations of approximately $30.0 million, received proceeds of approximately $299,000 from the exercise of stock options, sold property and equipment for proceeds of approximately $1.4 million, received approximately $566,000 from the sale of investment securities and borrowed $40.2 million under a then existing credit facility. These funds were used primarily to acquire drilling rigs, related equipment and associated intangible assets of approximately $45.5 million, to provide certain necessary refurbishment of approximately $26.4 million to the Company's operable drilling fleet, to reduce certain notes payable by approximately $7.7 million and to fund leasehold acquisition, exploration and development of approximately $7.7 million.       On January 5, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of Lone Star Mud, Inc. ("Lone Star"), a privately-owned, non-affiliated company based in Midland, Texas for a purchase price of approximately $13.0 million consisting of $1.4 million in cash, 571,328 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $17.41 per share, which was the market price on the acquisition date, the assumption of $1.6 million of debt and approximately $3,300 of direct costs incurred related to the acquisition. Lone Star is a provider of drilling fluids to the oil and natural gas industry. Management of the Company viewed the acquisition as an opportunity to enter into a related segment of the oilfield service industry, which would integrate well with the Company's existing operations.       On February 6, 1998, the Company completed its merger with Robertson Onshore Drilling Company ("Robertson"), a privately-owned, non-affiliated contract drilling company based in Dallas, Texas. The purchase price of $42.2 million consisted of $3.25 million in cash, $36.75 million provided by the Company's line of credit, the assumption of $1.8 million of debt and approximately $444,000 of direct costs incurred related to the acquisition. As a result of the merger, the Company acquired 15 operable drilling rigs, increasing the Company's rig fleet to 114 drilling rigs, and a shop and yard located in Liberty City, Texas.       On September 17, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of Tejas Drilling Fluids, Inc. ("Tejas"), a privately-owned, non-affiliated company based in Corpus Christi, Texas for a purchase price of approximately $3.5 million cash and approximately $74,000 of direct costs incurred related to the acquisition. Tejas is a provider of drilling fluids to the oil and natural gas industry with its primary focus of operations in the south Texas region.       At May 31, 1998, the Company's existing $70.0 million line of credit with Norwest Bank Texas, N.A. ("Norwest") converted to a term note with a maturity date of January 1, 2001 with a seven-year, level-principal amortization. The note bears interest at the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 2.375%. At the time of conversion, the Company had drawn $60.0 million under the available credit facility. The Company is currently making monthly principal and interest payments of approximately $1.1 million as required by the underlying agreement until its maturity at January 1, 2001.                                         18    19       At December 31, 1998, the Company was in violation of the positive net income covenant provision of such credit agreement. The Company obtained a waiver of such violation from Norwest as of December 31, 1998. In addition, the credit agreement was further amended to replace the positive net income covenant with an earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA) to quarterly interest expense provision. The Company must maintain on a quarterly basis an EBITDA to interest expense of at least 2.25 to 1.0. Although there can be no assurances, management does not anticipate a future violation of such covenant.       Management believes that the current level of cash and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company's immediate capital needs. From time to time, the Company reviews acquisition opportunities relating to its business. The timing, size or success of any acquisition and the associated capital commitments are unpredictable. Should further opportunities for growth requiring capital arise, the Company believes it would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash from operations, and either debt or equity financing. However, there can be no assurance that such capital would be available.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1997       For the year ended December 31, 1998, contract drilling revenues were approximately $166.0 million as compared to $178.3 million for the same period in 1997, a decrease of approximately 7%. Average rig utilization was 54% on an average of 106 rigs available for service for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to 89% on an average of 73 rigs available for service for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997. Direct drilling costs were $128.8 million or 78% of drilling revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998, while direct drilling costs were $128.4 million or 72% of related drilling revenues for 1997. General and administrative expense for the contract drilling operations was approximately $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to approximately $5.4 million in 1997. The increase in general and administrative expense was largely attributable to additional expense associated with the administrative offices of Lone Star Mud Company and Robertson Onshore Drilling Company acquired by the Company during January and February 1998, respectively. The administrative responsibilities of the Robertson Onshore operations were terminated during July 1998 and absorbed by the Company's personnel in Snyder, Texas. Depreciation and amortization expense for the contract drilling segment increased from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 to approximately $22.4 million for the same twelve-month period in 1998. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was largely attributable to the increased number of drilling rigs added by acquisitions completed during fiscal years 1997 and 1998. For the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, operating income from the Company's contract drilling operations was approximately $9.3 million as compared to approximately $32.7 million in 1997. The decreased profitability was largely attributable to the 35% decrease in the Company's rig utilization rates , a change in drilling contracts which required the Company to bear certain costs in associated with drilling wells that in 1997 was paid by the Company's customers, and, to a lesser extent, moderate decrease during 1998 by the Company in its daily drilling rates. These three factors are reflective of the detrimental impact the industry's weakened commodity prices had on the Company's operations.       Oil and natural gas sales revenues were approximately $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, as compared to approximately $10.8 million in 1997. The volume of oil and natural gas sold by the Company decreased by approximately 29% in 1998, as compared to fiscal year 1997. The average price per Bbl of crude oil received by the Company was $12.16 in 1998, as compared to $17.86 in 1997, and the average price per Mcf of natural gas was $1.93 in 1998, as compared to $2.19 in 1997. Lease operating and production costs were $4.08 per BOE in 1998, as compared to $3.41 per BOE in 1997. General and administrative expense for the oil and natural gas segment was approximately $1.3 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Exploration costs increased moderately by approximately 3% to $669,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. Depreciation and depletion expense was approximately $4.8 million in 1998, as compared to approximately $5.0 million in 1997. During 1998, primarily as a result of the industry's significantly reduced commodity prices, the Company impaired certain of its oil and natural gas                                        19    20  properties by $3.8 million. The Company incurred impairment expense of approximately $355,000 in 1997. Other revenues generated by the oil and natural gas segment, consisting primarily of fees generated from lease operating activities, were approximately $1.5 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the oil and natural gas segment generated a loss from operations of approximately $6.2 million as compared to income of approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decrease in the segment's operating results was primarily attributable to the decrease in the underlying commodity prices, particularly the 32% decrease in the price received for crude oil, as discussed above.       Although the contract drilling and oil and natural gas segments represent the Company's core operations, the Company derived operating revenues of approximately $13.4 million from its drilling fluid services. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company incurred approximately $13.0 million of operating costs associated with its drilling fluid activities, including depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $895,000 and general and administrative expense of approximately $1.9 million. The Company generated approximately $360,000 of operating income from its contract drilling fluid services for the year ended December 31, 1998.       For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company incurred interest expense of approximately $4.5 million as compared to $1.0 million in 1997. This increase was due to the additional $36.75 million borrowed during February 1998 in the Company's acquisition of Robertson. In 1998, the Company recognized a net gain on the sale of property and equipment of $636,000 as compared to approximately $1.5 million in 1997. The decrease in 1998 was largely attributable to the sale of the Company's interest in an oil and natural gas property of approximately $813,000 during fiscal year 1997.  COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1996       For the year ended December 31, 1997, contract drilling revenues were approximately $178.3 million as compared to $73.6 million for the same period in 1996, an increase of approximately 142%. Average rig utilization increased approximately 13% to 89% for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997. Direct drilling costs were $128.4 million or 72% of drilling revenues for the year ended December 31, 1997, while direct drilling costs were $59.6 million or 81% of related drilling revenues for 1996. The increase in contract drilling revenues and associated drilling costs was primarily attributable to the addition of 35 drilling rigs to the Company's operable drilling fleet during fiscal year 1997 and the addition of 13 operable drilling rigs during the fourth quarter of 1996. General and administrative expense for the contract drilling operations was approximately $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to approximately $4.0 million in 1996. As a result of the Company's recent capital acquisitions, depreciation expense increased from approximately $6.8 million in 1996 to approximately $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. These increased levels of depreciation expense are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. For the twelve months ended December 31, 1997, income from the Company's contract drilling operations was approximately $32.7 million as compared to approximately $3.9 million in 1996. This increased profitability was largely attributable to the increased rig utilization rate attained during 1997 and, to a lesser extent, moderate increases realized by the Company during 1997 in its daily drilling rates.       Oil and natural gas sales revenues were approximately $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1997, as compared to approximately $8.3 million in 1996. The volume of oil and natural gas sold by the Company increased by approximately 30% in 1997, as compared to fiscal year 1996. The average price per Bbl of crude oil received by the Company was $17.86 in 1997, as compared to $20.99 in 1996, and the average price per Mcf of natural gas was $2.19 in 1997, as compared to $2.01 in 1996. Lease operating production costs were $3.41 per BOE in 1997, as compared to $3.91 per BOE in 1996. General and administrative expense for the oil and natural gas segment was approximately $1.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996. Exploration costs were $647,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997, as compared to approximately $466,000 in 1996. Depreciation and depletion expense was approximately $5.0 million in 1997, as compared to approximately $3.1 million in 1996. The Company incurred impairment expense of approximately $355,000 and $549,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Other revenues generated by the oil and natural gas segment, consisting primarily of fees generated from lease                                        20    21  operating activities, were approximately $1.6 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the oil and natural gas segment generated income from operations of approximately $2.4 million as compared to income of approximately $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.       For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company incurred interest expense of $1.045 million as compared to $1.6 million in 1996. The decrease in interest expense related to the Company's early retirement of its notes payable during the first quarter of 1997 using proceeds provided by its equity offering completed during that time. In 1997, the Company recognized a net gain on the sale of property and equipment of $1.5 million as compared to approximately $546,000 in 1996. The increase in 1997 was largely attributable to the sale of the Company's interest in an oil and natural gas property of approximately $813,000.       In 1997, as a result of the Company's increased profitability and reduced benefit of certain deferred tax assets, the Company incurred income tax expense of approximately $12.9 million as compared to a net income tax benefit of $2.3 million in 1996. As previously reported, the Company fully reduced its valuation allowance existing against its deferred tax assets in prior periods recognizing the related benefit. To the degree that the Company generates income in excess of its remaining deferred tax assets, it will incur income tax expense at its effective statutory rate.  INCOME TAXES       At December 31, 1998, the Company had tax net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of approximately $4.2 million. These NOL carryforwards expire at various dates from 1999 through 2012, subject to certain limitations. Prior to August 3, 1995, the Company realized substantial federal income tax savings due to the NOL carryforwards. The utilization of these NOL carryforwards prior to that date effectively reduced the current federal income tax rate. During 1995, the Company's NOL carryforwards became subject to an annual limitation due to a change of over 50% in the stock ownership of the Company as defined in Internal Revenue Service Code Section 382(g). The NOL carryforwards that can be utilized to offset net income in any year will be equal to approximately $3.3 million. The NOL limitation is determined by the value of the Company's equity on August 2, 1995, the day prior to the ownership change, times 5.88%, the Federal long- term exempt rate on that date as published by the U.S. Treasury Department, or $1.8 million, and approximately $1.5 million which is determined by the value of Tucker Drilling Company, Inc.'s equity on July 29, 1996, the day prior to consummation of the Merger, times 5.78%, the Federal long-term exempt rate on that date.       During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company began recording non-cash Federal deferred income taxes based primarily on the relationship between the amount of the Company's unused Federal NOL carryforwards and the temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis in the Company's assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of its deferred income taxes, the Company will incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized. The Company incurred deferred income tax expense of approximately $6.5 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  VOLATILITY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES       The Company's revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas, both with respect to its contract drilling and its oil and natural gas segments. Historically, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile. Prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as actions of state and local agencies, the United States and foreign governments and international cartels. All of these are beyond the control of the Company. Any significant or extended decline in oil and/or natural gas prices will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The sharp decline in crude oil prices beginning in the fourth quarter of 1997 has materially impacted the Company's operations. Should oil prices remain at current                                         21    22  levels or continue to decline or natural gas prices decline significantly from current prices, the Company's operations would be further adversely affected.  IMPACT OF INFLATION       The Company believes that inflation will not have a significant impact on its financial position.  RECENTLY-ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS       During 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" ("SFAS No. 130"), which establishes standards for reporting and presentation of comprehensive income and its components (revenues, expenses, gains and losses) in a full set of general- purpose financial statements. SFAS No. 130 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. SFAS No. 130 requires that an enterprise (i) classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and (ii) display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position. The Company's adoption of SFAS No. 130 did not result in any significant changes to its related reporting disclosures.       During the quarter ended March 31, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS No. 131"). SFAS No. 131 establishes revised guidelines for determining an entity's operating segments and the type and level of financial information to be disclosed. The Company's adoption of SFAS No. 131 did not result in any significant changes to its related reporting disclosures.       The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," ("SFAS No. 132") in February 1998. SFAS No. 132 revises employers' disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement recognition of those plans. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. The Company's adoption of SFAS No. 132 in September 1998 did not result in any changes to the Company.       The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," ("SFAS No. 133") in June 1998. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. The provisions of SFAS No. 133 are not expected to have a material impact to the Company.  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE PROGRAM       During fiscal year 1997, the Company began implementation of its program for alleviating potential business interruptions that could be caused by the year 2000. The Company's program identified two principal areas of concern: supporting information technology systems ("IT systems") and the Company's related vulnerability to external providers of services and materials.       The Company currently maintains three separate infrastructures to facilitate the processing of daily transactions and financial reporting. Each of the lines of business engaged in by the Company function separately from the other and therefore operates on individual computer platforms. The Company has completed its conversion of each of the computer platforms resulting in the replacement and modification of certain hardware and software applications that previously were determined not to be compliant with year 2000 issues.       The ability of the Company to conduct its business efficiently and productively requires that providers of services and materials to the Company, as well as, major customers to the Company (collectively referred to herein as "external agents") be year 2000 compliant. The Company has implemented a process whereby                                        22    23  external agents are identified and prioritized by level of exposure. Management of the Company is in the process of assessing the readiness and effectiveness of its external agents for the year 2000. Surveys, solicitations and other forms of inquiry are being used to make this determination. Management intends to interpret the responses and information gathered and determine on an individual basis whether the Company is vulnerable to that external agent. This process will continue through January 2000 as a means to provide a continuous update as to the external agents' status and success.       The Company does not expect the total cost associated with the Company's efforts to become year 2000 compliant to be material to the Company's financial position. The total amount expended on the project through December 31, 1998 was approximately $1.75 million. The Company expects to significantly reduce its level of uncertainty about year 2000 issues and, in particular, about the year 2000 compliance and readiness of its external agents. Accordingly, the Company does not deem it necessary to formally adopt a contingency plan.       The failure to correct a material year 2000 problem could result in an interruption in, or a failure of, certain normal business activities or operations. Such failures could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year 2000 problem, resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year 2000 readiness of third-party suppliers and customers, the Company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year 2000 failures will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. The Company believes that, with the implementation of new business systems and completion of its program as scheduled, the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced.       The foregoing disclosure constitutes "Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure" within the meaning of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company has exposure to market risk associated with the floating rate portion of the interest charged on its $55.7 million term loan with Norwest Bank Texas, N.A. The term loan, which matures on January 1, 2001, bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.375%. The Company's exposure to interest rate risk due to changes in LIBOR is not expected to be material and at December 31, 1998, the fair value of the obligation approximates its related carrying value because the obligation bears interest at the current market rate.
