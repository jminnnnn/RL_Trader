Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Recent Developments  —  On November 15, 2019, we completed an offering  of $350 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.15% Senior Notes due November 15, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The net proceeds before offering expenses were approximately $347 million. On December 16, 2019, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to prepay our 4.27% Series B Senior Notes due June 14, 2022 (the “Series B Notes”). The total amount of the prepayment, including the applicable “make-whole” premium, was approximately $315 million, plus accrued interest to the prepayment date. The remaining net proceeds and available cash on hand was used to repay $50 million of the borrowings under the  Term Loan Agreement (as defined below).  On August 22, 2019, we entered into a term loan agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”) that permits a single borrowing of up to $150 million, which we drew in full on September 23, 2019. Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders’ aggregate commitments be increased by up to $75 million, not to exceed total commitments of $225 million. On September 25, 2019, we used $150 million of borrowings from the Term Loan Agreement and approximately $158 million of cash on hand to prepay our  4.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 5, 2020 (the  “Series A Notes”). The total amount of the prepayment, including the applicable “make-whole” premium, was approximately $308 million, plus accrued interest to the prepayment date.  We repaid $50 million of the borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement on December 16, 2019, and we had $100 million in outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2019.  On October 25, 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Current Power Solutions, Inc. (“Current Power”). Current Power is a provider of electrical controls and automation to the energy, marine and mining industries. Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the Current Power business in our other operations since October 25, 2018.  On March 27, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which is a committed senior unsecured revolving credit facility that permits  aggregate borrowings of up to $600 million, including a letter of credit facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $20 million.  See “ Liquidity and Capital Resources.”  On February 20, 2018, we acquired the business of Superior QC, LLC (“Superior QC”), including its assets and intellectual property. Superior QC is a provider of  software and services used to improve the statistical accuracy  of horizontal wellbore placement. Superior QC’s measurement-while-drilling (MWD) Survey FDIR (fault detection, isolation and recovery) service is a data analytics technology to analyze MWD survey data in real-time and more accurately identify the position of a well. Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the Superior QC business in our directional drilling segment since February 20, 2018.  On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.95% Senior Notes due 2028  (the “2028 Notes”) . We used $239 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.  Management Overview  — We are a Houston, Texas-based oilfield services company that primarily owns and operates one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs in the United States and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment. Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and western Canada, and, from time to time, we pursue contract drilling opportunities outside of North America. Our pressure pumping business operates primarily in Texas and the Mid-Continent and Appalachian regions. We also provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States, and we provide services that improve the statistical accuracy of horizontal wellbore placement. We have other operations through which we provide oilfield rental tools in select markets in the United States. We also service equipment for drilling contractors, and we provide electrical controls and automation to the energy, marine and mining industries in North America and other select markets. In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.   30      Oil prices have recovered from a 12-year low of $26.19 in February 2016 and reached a high of $77.41 in June 2018. Oil prices remain volatile, as the closing price of oil began the year at a low of $46.31 per barrel on January  2 , 2019, before increasing by 43% over the course of four months  to reach a high of $66.24 per barrel in late April 2019.  Since May 2019, oil prices have generally ranged between $50 and $60 per barrel .  Oil prices averaged $ 56.94  per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2019 and closed at $ 50.06  per barrel on February  3 , 2020. Quarterly average oil prices and  our  quarterly average number of rigs operating in the United States for 201 7 , 201 8 , and 201 9  are as follows:                 1 st           2 nd           3 rd           4 th                 Quarter           Quarter           Quarter           Quarter         2017:                                                                     Average oil price per Bbl  (1)       $   51.77           $   48.24           $   48.16           $   55.37         Average rigs operating per day - U.S.  (2)           81               145               159               159         2018:                                                                     Average oil price per Bbl  (1)       $   62.88           $   68.04           $   69.76           $   59.08         Average rigs operating per day - U.S.  (2)           166               175               177               182         2019:                                                                     Average oil price per Bbl  (1)       $   54.83           $   59.78           $   56.37           $   56.94         Average rigs operating per day - U.S.  (2)           174               157               142               122               (1)   The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.      (2)   A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.  Our rig count declined significantly during the industry downturn that began in late 2014, improved following the second quarter of 2016, and has declined since the fourth quarter of 2018. Our average active rig count for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 123 rigs, which included 122 rigs in the United States  and less than one rig operating in Canada . This was a decrease from our average active rig count for the third quarter of 2019 of 142 rigs, which included 142 rigs in the United States and less than one rig in Canada. Our rig count in the United States at December 31, 2019 of 121 rigs was less than the rig count of 183 rigs at December 31, 2018. Term contracts have supported our operating rig count during the last three years. Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 77 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter of 2020 and an average of 58 rigs operating under term contracts throughout 2020.  The pressure pumping market showed signs of oversupply in the second half of 2018 and was oversupplied in 2019. In response to oversupplied market conditions, we reduced the number of active pressure pumping spreads to 11 as of the end of 2019.  We expect to average ten active pressure pumping spreads during the first quarter of 2020.   Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and upon our customers’ ability to access capital to fund their operating and capital expenditures. During periods of improved oil and natural gas prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services. Conversely, in periods when oil and natural gas prices deteriorate or when our customers have a reduced ability to access capital, the demand for our services generally weakens, and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.  The North American oil and natural gas services industry is cyclical and at times experiences downturns in demand. During these periods, there has been substantially more oil and natural gas service equipment available than necessary to meet demand. As a result, oil and natural gas service contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins and, at times, have incurred losses during the downturn periods. Currently, there is an excess supply of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and directional drilling equipment. We cannot predict either the future level of demand for our oil and natural gas services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas service businesses.  We are highly impacted by operational risks, competition, labor issues, weather, the availability of products used in our pressure pumping business, supplier delays and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report.    For the three years ended December 31, 2019, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):               2019           2018           2017                         Contract drilling       $   1,308,350               53.0   %       $   1,430,492               43.0   %       $   1,040,033               44.1   %     Pressure pumping           868,694               35.2   %           1,573,396               47.3   %           1,200,311               50.9   %     Directional drilling           188,786               7.6   %           209,275               6.3   %           45,580               1.9   %     Other           104,855               4.2   %           113,834               3.4   %           70,760               3.1   %             $   2,470,685               100.0   %       $   3,326,997               100.0   %       $   2,356,684               100.0   %       31      Contract Drilling  Contract drilling revenues accounted for 53.0% of our consolidated 2019 revenues and decreased 8.5% from 2018.   We have addressed our customers’ needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years. The U.S. land rig industry refers to certain high specification rigs as “super-spec” rigs. We consider a super-spec rig to be a 1,500 horsepower, AC powered rig that has at least a 750,000-pound hookload, a 7,500-psi circulating system, and is pad-capable. As of December 31, 2019, our rig fleet included 198 APEX ®  rigs, of which 150 were super-spec rigs.  We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling services under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a duration of six months or more. Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $605 million and $770 million, respectively. Approximately 28% of the total contract drilling backlog at December 31, 2019 is reasonably expected to remain after 2020. We generally calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract. The calculation does not include any revenues related to fees for other services such as for mobilization, other than initial mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract. For contracts that contain variable dayrate pricing, our backlog calculation uses the dayrate in effect for periods where the dayrate is fixed, and, for periods that remain subject to variable pricing, uses the commodity price in effect at December 31, 2019. In addition, our term drilling contracts are generally subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer. For contracts on which we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate, for the period over which we expect to receive the lower rate. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.”  Ongoing factors which could continue to adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:          •   movement of drilling rigs from region to region,          •   reactivation of drilling rigs,          •   refurbishment and upgrades of existing drilling rigs,           •   development of new technologies that enhance drilling efficiency, and          •   construction of new technology drilling rigs.   Pressure Pumping  Pressure pumping revenues accounted for 35.2% of our consolidated 2019 revenues and decreased 44.8% from 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1.4 million horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet. The pressure pumping market showed signs of oversupply in the second half of 2018 and was oversupplied in 2019. In response to oversupplied market conditions, we reduced the number of active pressure pumping spreads to 11 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect to average ten active pressure pumping spreads during the first quarter of 2020.  Directional Drilling  Directional drilling revenues accounted for 7.6% of our consolidated 2019 revenues and decreased 9.8% from 2018. Activity for directional drilling commenced with the acquisition of MS Directional, LLC (f/k/a Multi-Shot, LLC) (“MS Directional”) in October 2017, which provides a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States. Our directional drilling services include directional drilling, downhole performance motors, measurement-while-drilling, and wireline steering tools, and we provide services that improve the statistical accuracy of horizontal wellbore placement.  Other Operations  Other operations revenues accounted for 4.2% of our consolidated 2019 revenues and decreased 7.9% from 2018.  Our oilfield rentals business, with a fleet of premium oilfield rental tools, provides the largest revenue contribution to our other operations and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities.   Other operations also includes the results of our electrical controls and automation business, the results of our drilling equipment service business, and the results of our ownership,  as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.  32      Capital Expenditures  Cash capital expenditures for 2019 totaled $348 million. For 2020, based on near-term activity levels, we expect cash used for capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million.  For the three years ended December 31, 2019, our operating income (loss) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):               2019           2018           2017         Contract drilling       $   (151,329   )           32.8   %       $   (33,115   )           10.3   %       $   (171,897   )           58.8   %     Pressure pumping           (102,701   )           22.3   %           (77,328   )           24.0   %           21,028               (7.2   )%     Directional drilling           (52,724   )           11.4   %           (117,497   )           36.5   %           (21   )           —   %     Other           (54,725   )           11.9   %           (18,221   )           5.7   %           (20,813   )           7.1   %     Corporate           (100,097   )           21.6   %           (76,016   )           23.5   %           (120,835   )           41.3   %             $   (461,576   )           100.0   %       $   (322,177   )           100.0   %       $   (292,538   )           100.0   %    Discussion of our operating income (loss) follows in the “Results of Operations” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Lower demand for our contract drilling and pressure pumping services in 2019, an impairment of goodwill and write-downs to drilling and pressure pumping equipment and an increase in interest expense due to the 2019 prepayment of the Series A Notes and Series B Notes contributed to a consolidated net loss of $426 million for 2019, compared to a consolidated net loss of $321 million for 2018 and consolidated net income of $5.9 million for 2017. Our net income for 2017 was positive due to the 2017 tax law change.  Results of Operations   Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018   The following tables summarize results of operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:               Year Ended December 31,         Contract Drilling       2019           2018           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   1,308,350           $   1,430,492               (8.5   )%     Direct operating costs           785,355               885,704               (11.3   )%     Margin  (1)           522,995               544,788               (4.0   )%     Selling, general and administrative           6,317               6,296               0.3   %     Depreciation, amortization and impairment           668,007               571,607               16.9   %     Operating loss       $   (151,329   )       $   (33,115   )           357.0   %     Operating days           54,544               64,479               (15.4   )%     Average revenue per operating day       $   23.99           $   22.19               8.1   %     Average direct operating costs per operating day       $   14.40           $   13.74               4.8   %     Average margin per operating day   (1)       $   9.59           $   8.45               13.5   %     Average rigs operating           149.4               176.7               (15.4   )%     Capital expenditures       $   194,416           $   394,595               (50.7   )%                             (1)    Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days.      Generally, the revenues in our contract drilling segment are most impacted by two primary factors: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.  During 2019, our average number of rigs operating was 149, compared to 177 in 2018. Our average rig revenue per operating day was $23,990 in 2019, compared to $22,190 in 2018. Our average revenue per operating day is largely dependent on the pricing terms of our rig contracts.      Revenues and direct operating costs decreased in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in operating days. Average revenue per operating day increased in 2019. This increase was supported by our upgrades of additional rigs to super-spec capability.     Depreciation, amortization and impairment for 2019 included a charge of $173 million related to the retirement of 36 legacy non-APEX® drilling rigs and related equipment. Depreciation, amortization and impairment for 2018 included a charge of $48.4 million  related to the retirement of 42 legacy non- APEX®  drilling rigs and related equipment.     Capital expenditures decreased in 2019 primarily due to  upgrading more rigs to super-spec capability in 2018 relative to 2019.     33                  Year Ended December 31,         Pressure Pumping       2019           2018           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   868,694           $   1,573,396               (44.8   )%     Direct operating costs           724,788               1,263,850               (42.7   )%     Margin  (1)           143,906               309,546               (53.5   )%     Selling, general and administrative           12,655               15,420               (17.9   )%     Depreciation, amortization and impairment           233,952               250,010               (6.4   )%     Impairment of goodwill           —               121,444           NA         Operating loss       $   (102,701   )       $   (77,328   )           32.8   %     Fracturing jobs           505               812               (37.8   )%     Other jobs           844               1,081               (21.9   )%     Total jobs           1,349               1,893               (28.7   )%     Average revenue per fracturing job       $   1,673.81           $   1,909.42               (12.3   )%     Average revenue per other job       $   27.75           $   21.23               30.7   %     Average revenue per total job       $   643.95           $   831.17               (22.5   )%     Average direct operating costs per total job       $   537.28           $   667.64               (19.5   )%     Average margin per total job  (1)       $   106.68           $   163.52               (34.8   )%     Margin as a percentage of revenues  (1)           16.6   %           19.7   %           (15.7   )%     Capital expenditures       $   105,803           $   173,848               (39.1   )%           (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs. Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues.   Generally, the revenues in our pressure pumping segment are most impacted by our number of fracturing jobs and the size (including whether or not we provide proppant and other materials) of those jobs, which is reflected in our average revenue per   fracturing job. Direct operating costs are also most impacted by these same factors. Our average revenue per fracturing job is largely dependent on the pricing terms of our pressure pumping contracts. We completed 505 fracturing jobs during 2019 compared to 812 fracturing jobs in 2018. Our average revenue per fracturing job was $1.674 million in 2019 compared to $1.909 million in 2018.    Revenues and direct operating costs decreased in 2019  primarily due to a decline in the number of fracturing jobs. Average revenue and direct operating costs per job were impacted by lower demand, more customers self-sourcing products and decreases in product prices.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of cost reduction efforts.  Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense  included charges of $20.5 million and $17.4 million related to the write-down of pressure pumping equipment in 2019 and 2018, respectively.  All of the goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business was impaired during 2018. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to higher maintenance capital expenditures in 2018 when activity levels were higher.              Year Ended December 31,         Directional Drilling       2019           2018           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   188,786           $   209,275               (9.8   )%     Direct operating costs           178,645               175,829               1.6   %     Margin  (1)           10,141               33,446               (69.7   )%     Selling, general and administrative           10,642               15,941               (33.2   )%     Depreciation and amortization           52,223               45,317               15.2   %     Impairment of goodwill           —               89,685           NA         Operating loss       $   (52,724   )       $   (117,497   )           (55.1   )%     Capital expenditures       $   15,549           $   35,929               (56.7   )%           (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses.   Directional drilling revenue decreased by $20.5 million from 2018 primarily due to decreased job activity, partially offset by increased revenue from Superior QC, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2018.  34      Direct operating costs  for 2019 included a charge of $17.0 million primarily due to the  write-down of inventory , partially offset by lower operating costs due to decreased job activity .    Selling, general and administrative expense decreased from 2018 primarily as a result of cost reduction efforts.  Depreciation, amortization and impairment  for 2019 included a charge of $8.4 million related to the write-down of directional drilling equipment. There were no similar charges in 2018.   The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to higher capital expenditures in 2018 in response to market demand for equipment upgrades.              Year Ended December 31,         Other Operations       2019           2018           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   104,855           $   113,834               (7.9   )%     Direct operating costs           84,909               77,104               10.1   %     Margin   (1)           19,946               36,730               (45.7   )%     Selling, general and administrative           14,068               13,439               4.7   %     Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment           42,803               41,512               3.1   %     Impairment of goodwill           17,800               —           NA         Operating loss       $   (54,725   )       $   (18,221   )           200.3   %     Capital expenditures       $   27,132           $   34,660               (21.7   )%           (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.   Other operations revenue decreased primarily due to a decline in revenue in our oilfield rentals business.  During the third quarter of 2019, we made the decision to transition away from our engineering and manufacturing efforts in Calgary. Direct operating costs and selling, general and administrative costs for 2019 include $12.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of charges associated with this decision. The $12.4 million of charges to direct operating costs is primarily comprised of inventory write-offs.  All of the goodwill associated with our oilfield rentals and electrical controls and automation reporting units was impaired during 2019.  The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to 2018 investments in the oilfield rentals business.              Year Ended December 31,         Corporate       2019           2018           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Selling, general and administrative       $   89,831           $   82,975               8.3   %     Merger and integration expenses       $   —           $   2,738           NA         Depreciation       $   6,888           $   7,872               (12.5   )%     Other operating (income) expense, net                                                     Net gain on asset disposals       $   (13,904   )       $   (28,958   )           (52.0   )%     Legal-related expenses and settlements, net of insurance reimbursements           (3,471   )           12,684           NA         Research and development           3,840               3,444               11.5   %     Other           11,230               (4,739   )       NA         Other operating income, net       $   (2,305   )       $   (17,569   )           (86.9   )%     Provision for bad debts       $   5,683           $   —           NA         Interest income       $   6,013           $   5,597               7.4   %     Interest expense       $   75,204           $   51,578               45.8   %     Other income       $   389           $   750               (48.1   )%     Capital expenditures       $   4,612           $   2,426               90.1   %    Selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2019 due to an increase in compensation related expenses. Merger and integration expenses incurred in 2018 are related to the Seventy Seven Energy Inc. merger (the “SSE merger”),  MS Directional  acquisition and Superior QC acquisition.    35      Other operating  expenses (income), net  includes net gains associated with the disposal of assets. Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been excluded from the results of specific segments. The majority of the net gain on asset disposals during 2019 reflect s  gains on disposal of drilling equipment.  Legal-related expenses and settlements in 2018 includes insurance deductibles and investigation costs related to an accident at a drilling site in January 2018. Legal-related expenses and settlements in 2019 includes proceeds from insurance claims.  Other operating  expenses (income), net includes a $12.7 million charge recorded in 2019 related to a 2017 capacity reservation  agreement that required a cash deposit to increase our access to finer grades of sand for our pressure pumping business . As market prices for sand substantially decreased since 2017, we  purchased  lower cost sand outside of this capacity reservation contract and revalued the deposit at its expected realizable value. Other operating expenses (income), net includes  a  gain recorded in 2018 related to the collection of a note receivable that had been recorded at a discount.  A provision for bad debts was recognized in 2019 with respect to accounts receivable balances that were estimated to be uncollectible. Interest expense includes a loss on early debt extinguishment of $24.0 million in 2019 as a result of prepayment of the Series A Notes and Series B Notes.

Our average revenue per operating day is largely dependent on the pricing terms of our rig contracts.     Revenues and direct operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in operating days. Operating days and average rigs operating increased in 2018 primarily due to the recovery in the oil and natural gas industry, the contribution of rigs acquired in the SSE merger and the contribution from rigs that have been upgraded to super-spec capability. Capital expenditures increased in 2018 due to the upgrade of rigs to super-spec capability, higher maintenance capital expenditures and other equipment upgrades. Depreciation, amortization and impairment for 2018 included a charge of $48.4 million related to the retirement of 42 legacy non-APEX® rigs and related equipment. Based on the strong customer preference across the industry for super-spec drilling rigs, we believe the 42 rigs that were retired had limited commercial opportunity. Depreciation, amortization and impairment for 2017 included a charge of $29.0 million for the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability.   36                  Year Ended December 31,         Pressure Pumping       2018           2017           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   1,573,396           $   1,200,311               31.1   %     Direct operating costs           1,263,850               966,835               30.7   %     Margin  (1)           309,546               233,476               32.6   %     Selling, general and administrative           15,420               14,442               6.8   %     Depreciation, amortization and impairment           250,010               198,006               26.3   %     Impairment of goodwill           121,444               —           NA         Operating income (loss)       $   (77,328   )       $   21,028           NA         Fracturing jobs           812               622               30.5   %     Other jobs           1,081               1,262               (14.3   )%     Total jobs           1,893               1,884               0.5   %     Average revenue per fracturing job       $   1,909.42           $   1,894.40               0.8   %     Average revenue per other job       $   21.23           $   17.43               21.8   %     Average revenue per total job       $   831.17           $   637.11               30.5   %     Average direct operating costs per total job       $   667.64           $   513.18               30.1   %     Average margin per total job  (1)       $   163.52           $   123.93               31.9   %     Margin as a percentage of revenues  (1)           19.7   %           19.5   %           1.0   %     Capital expenditures       $   173,848           $   171,436               1.4   %           (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.  Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs.  Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues.     Generally, the revenues in our pressure pumping segment are most impacted by our number of fracturing jobs and the size (including whether or not we provide proppant and other materials) of those jobs, which is reflected in our average revenue per fracturing job. We completed 812 fracturing jobs during 2018 compared to 622 fracturing jobs in 2017. Our average revenue per fracturing job was $1.909 million in 2018 compared to $1.894 million in 2017.       Revenues and direct operating costs in 2018 increased primarily due to an increase in the number of fracturing jobs. Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense increased due to the assets acquired in the SSE merger. Also included in depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2018 is a charge of $17.4 million related to the write-down of obsolete sand-handling equipment. There was no similar charge in the comparable period of 2017. All of the goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business was impaired during 2018.

Margins in 2018 were negatively impacted by higher third-party rental expenses due to delays in the delivery of equipment and by higher repairs and maintenance costs. All of the goodwill associated with our directional drilling business was impaired during 2018. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  37                  Year Ended December 31,         Other Operations       2018           2017           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   113,834           $   70,760               60.9   %     Direct operating costs           77,104               51,428               49.9   %     Margin  (1)           36,730               19,332               90.0   %     Selling, general and administrative           13,439               10,743               25.1   %     Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment           41,512               29,402               41.2   %     Operating loss       $   (18,221   )       $   (20,813   )           (12.5   )%     Capital expenditures       $   34,660           $   31,547               9.9   %           (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation,  depletion, amortization and impairment and  selling, general and administrative expenses.  Revenues, direct operating costs, and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense from other operations increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of our oilfield rentals business acquired in the SSE merger on April 20, 2017. The increase in capital expenditures was due to investments in the oilfield rentals business.                 Year Ended December 31,         Corporate       2018           2017           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Selling, general and administrative       $   82,975           $   70,646               17.5   %     Merger and integration expenses       $   2,738           $   74,451               (96.3   )%     Depreciation       $   7,872           $   7,695               2.3   %     Other operating (income) expense, net                                                     Net gain on asset disposals       $   (28,958   )       $   (33,510   )           (13.6   )%     Legal-related expenses and settlements, net of insurance reimbursements           12,684               561           NA         Research and development           3,444               1,002               243.7   %     Other           (4,739   )           (10   )       NA         Other operating income, net       $   (17,569   )       $   (31,957   )           (45.0   )%     Interest income       $   5,597           $   1,866               199.9   %     Interest expense       $   51,578           $   37,472               37.6   %     Other income       $   750           $   343               118.7   %     Capital expenditures       $   2,426           $   1,884               28.8   %    Selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2018, but as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 2.5%, compared to 3.0% in 2017. Selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2018 primarily due to the personnel added as a result of the SSE merger. Merger and integration expenses incurred in 2018 are related to the SSE merger, the MS Directional acquisition and the Superior QC acquisition. Merger and integration expenses incurred in 2017 are related to the SSE merger and the MS Directional acquisition. Other operating income includes net gains associated with the disposal of assets. Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been excluded from the results of specific segments. The majority of the net gain on asset disposals during the 2018 period reflects gains on disposal of drilling equipment. The 2017 period included a gain of $11.2 million related to the sale of real estate. Legal-related expenses and settlements in 2018 includes insurance deductibles and investigation costs related to an accident at a drilling site in January 2018. Research and development expense during 2018 and 2017 relate primarily to the funding of research into pressure pumping technology. Other operating income during 2018 also includes the gain on the collection of a note receivable that had previously been discounted. Interest income increased in 2018 due to interest earned on the portion of the proceeds of the January 2018 debt offering that were held as cash during 2018. The debt offering also resulted in an increase in interest expense for 2018.     Income Taxes                  Year Ended December 31,                 2019           2018           2017                 (Dollars in thousands)         Loss before income taxes       $   (530,378   )       $   (367,408   )       $   (327,801   )     Income tax benefit       $   (104,675   )       $   (45,987   )       $   (333,711   )     Effective tax rate           19.7   %           12.5   %           101.8   %    38      The  difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the  effective  income  tax rate  for  the years ended December 31,  201 9 ,  201 8  and 201 7  is summarized  as follows:              2019           2018           2017         Statutory tax rate           21.0   %           21.0   %           35.0   %     State income taxes - net of the federal income tax benefit           1.7               1.2               1.9         Goodwill impairment           (0.7   )           (6.9   )           —         Permanent differences           (0.5   )           (0.6   )           (1.3   )     Tax effects of tax reform           —               (1.3   )           66.7         Share-based payments           (0.7   )           (0.1   )           3.6         Acquisition related differences           —               —               (3.3   )     Valuation allowance           (0.8   )           (3.7   )           —         State deferred tax remeasurement           (1.1   )           2.3               —         Other differences, net           0.8               0.6               (0.8   )     Effective tax rate           19.7   %           12.5   %           101.8   %       The effective tax rate increased by approximately 7.2% to 19.7% for 2019 compared to 12.5% for 2018. This difference was primarily due to higher goodwill impairment charges in 2018 relative to 2019, which are not deductible for tax purposes. These charges resulted in a 6.9% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2018, as compared to a 0.7% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2019. Another factor was valuation allowances being established against deferred tax assets in certain state and non-U.S. jurisdictions, which were higher in 2018 as compared to 2019. These resulted in a 3.7% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2018, as compared to a 0.8% decrease to the rate in 2019.     We continue to monitor income tax developments in the United States and other countries affecting the Company. In December 2017, the United States enacted U.S. Tax Reform, which materially impacted the consolidated financial statements by decreasing the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate and significantly affecting future periods. We expect several proposed U.S. Treasury regulations under U.S. Tax Reform that were issued during 2018 and 2019 to be finalized during 2020. We will incorporate into our future financial statements the impacts, if any, of these regulations and additional authoritative guidance when finalized.     We continue to elect permanent reinvestment of unremitted earnings in Canada effective January 1, 2010, and we intend to do so for the foreseeable future. If we were to repatriate earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, it might be subject to certain income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our liquidity as of December 31, 2019 included approximately $231 million in working capital, including $174 million of cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $600 million available under our revolving credit facility.   On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes. We used $239 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As described below, on March 27, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which is a committed senior unsecured revolving credit facility that permits  aggregate borrowings of up to $600 million, including a letter of credit facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $20 million.  On August 22, 2019, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement, which permits a single borrowing of up to $150 million, which we drew in full on September 23, 2019. Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders’ aggregate commitments be increased by up to $75 million, not to exceed total commitments of $225 million. On September 25, 2019, we used $150 million of borrowings from the Term Loan Agreement and approximately $158 million of cash on hand to prepay the Series A Notes. The total amount of the prepayment, including the applicable “make-whole” premium, was approximately $308 million, plus accrued interest to the prepayment date. We repaid $50 million of the borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement on December 16, 2019, and we had $100 million in outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2019.  39      On November 15, 2019, we completed  an offering  of $350 million in aggregate principal amount of the  2029  Notes.  The net proceeds before offering expenses were approximately $347 million . On December 16, 2019, we used  a portion of the  net proceeds from the offering  to prepay   the  Series B Notes . The total amount of the prepayment, including the applicable “make-whole” premium, was approximately $315 million , plus accrued interest to the prepayment date . The remaining net proceeds  and  available cash on hand was used  to repay $ 50  million of the borrowings  under  the  Term Loan Agreement.  We believe our current liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to maintain and make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends for at least the next 12 months.   If we pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash flows from operating activities, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or additional debt or equity financing. However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.   As of December 31, 2019, we had working capital of $231 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $174 million, compared to working capital of $424 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $245 million, at December 31, 2018.   During 2019, our sources of cash flow included:           •    $696 million from operating activities,           •    $45.8 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment and insurance proceeds, and          •    $497 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.  During 2019,  we used $32.4 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $255 million for repurchases of our common stock, $308 million for the prepayment of the Series A Notes, $315 million for the prepayment of the Series B Notes, $50 million for the repayment of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and $348 million:          •   to make capital expenditures for the acquisition, betterment and refurbishment of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and, to a much lesser extent, equipment for our other businesses,          •   to acquire and procure equipment and facilities to support our drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling, oilfield rentals and manufacturing operations, and           •   to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis.   We paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2019 as follows:               Per Share           Total                                 (in thousands)         Paid on March 21, 2019       $   0.04           $   8,499         Paid on June 20, 2019           0.04               8,344         Paid on September 19, 2019           0.04               7,847         Paid on December 19, 2019           0.04               7,738         Total cash dividends       $   0.16           $   32,428        On February 5, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.04 per share to be paid on March 19, 2020 to holders of record as of March 5, 2020. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our debt agreements and other factors.  40      On September 6, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program that authorized purchases of up to $200 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. On July 25, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the authorization under the stock buyback program to allow for $250 million of future share repurchases. On February 6, 2019, our Board of Directors approved another increase of the authorization under the stock buyback program to allow for $250 million of future share repurchases. On July 24, 2019, our Board of Directors approved another increase of the authorization under the stock buyback program to allow for $250 million of future share repurchases.  All purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions. Purchases under the program are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Purchases may be made at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock purchased under the buyback program are held as treasury shares. There is no expiration date associated with the buyback program.  As of December 31, 2019, we had remaining authorization to purchase approximately $1 50  million of our outstanding common stock under the stock buyback program.  We acquired shares of stock from  directors in 2017 and  employees during 2019, 2018, and 2017 that are accounted for as treasury stock. Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price and employees’ tax withholding obligations upon the exercise of stock options. The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll withholding obligations upon the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units. These shares were acquired at fair market value. These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan and not pursuant to the stock buyback program.  Treasury stock acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in thousands):               2019           2018           2017                 Shares           Cost           Shares           Cost           Shares           Cost         Treasury shares at beginning of period           53,701,096           $   1,080,448               43,802,611           $   918,711               43,392,617           $   911,094         Purchases pursuant to stock buyback program           22,566,331               250,109               9,331,131               150,497               5,503               109         Acquisitions pursuant to long-term incentive plan           1,037,947               14,205               567,354               11,240               404,491               7,508         Other           31,013               372               —               —               —               —         Treasury shares at end of period           77,336,387           $   1,345,134               53,701,096           $   1,080,448               43,802,611           $   918,711        2019 Term Loan Agreement  —   On August 22, 2019, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement among us,   as borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and lender and the other lender party thereto.   The Term Loan Agreement is a committed senior unsecured term loan facility that permits a single borrowing of up to $150 million, which we drew in full on September 23, 2019. Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders’ aggregate commitments be increased by up to $75 million, not to exceed total commitments of $225 million. The maturity date under the Term Loan Agreement is June 10, 2022. We  repaid $50 million of the borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement on December 16, 2019.  Loans under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate. The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 1.00% to 1.375%, and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 0.00% to 0.375%, in each case determined based upon our credit rating. As of December 31, 2019, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans and base rate loans was 1.125% and 0.125%, respectively.  The Term Loan Agreement contains representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default and associated remedies that we believe are customary for agreements of this nature, including certain restrictions on our ability and each of our subsidiaries to incur debt and grant liens. If our credit rating is below investment grade, we will become subject to a restricted payment covenant, which would require us to have a Pro Forma Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00 immediately before and immediately after making any restricted payment.   The Term Loan Agreement requires mandatory prepayment in an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of new senior indebtedness (other than certain permitted indebtedness) if our credit rating is below investment grade. The Term Loan Agreement also requires that our total debt to capitalization ratio, expressed as a percentage, not exceed 50%. The Term Loan Agreement generally defines the total debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.  As of December 31, 2019, we had $100 million in borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement at a LIBOR interest rate of 2.917%.  Credit Agreement   —   On March 27, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) among us,  as  borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, letter of credit issuer, swing line lender and lender, each of the other lenders and letter of credit issuers party thereto, The Bank of Nova Scotia and U.S. Bank National   41      Association, as Co-Syndication Agents, Royal Bank of Canada, as Documentation Agent and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, The Bank of Nova Scotia and U.S. Bank National Association , as Co-Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Runners.  The Credit Agreement is a committed senior unsecured revolving credit facility that permits aggregate borrowings of up to $600 million, including a letter of credit facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $20 million. Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders’ aggregate commitments be increased by up to $300 million, not to exceed total commitments of $900 million. The original maturity date under the Credit Agreement was March 27, 2023. On March 26, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date under the Credit Agreement from March 27, 2023 to March 27, 2024. We have the option, subject to certain conditions, to exercise two one-year extensions of the maturity date.  Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate. The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 1.00% to 2.00% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 0.00% to 1.00%, in each case determined based upon our credit rating. A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the daily amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit. The commitment fee rate payable to the lenders varies from 0.10% to 0.30% based on our credit rating.  None of our subsidiaries are currently required to be a guarantor under the Credit Agreement. However, if any subsidiary guarantees or incurs debt in excess of the Priority Debt Basket (as defined in the Credit Agreement), such subsidiary is required to become a guarantor under the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default and associated remedies that we believe are customary for agreements of this nature, including certain restrictions on our ability and each of our subsidiaries to incur debt and grant liens. If our credit rating is below investment grade, we will become subject to a restricted payment covenant, which would require us to have a Pro Forma Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00 immediately before and immediately after making any restricted payment. The Credit Agreement also requires that our total debt to capitalization ratio, expressed as a percentage, not exceed 50%. The Credit Agreement generally defines the total debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.  As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We had $81,000 in letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2019 and, as a result, had available borrowing capacity of approximately $600 million at that date.   2015 Reimbursement Agreement  — On March 16, 2015, we entered into a Reimbursement Agreement (the “Reimbursement Agreement”) with The Bank of Nova Scotia (“Scotiabank”), pursuant to which we may from time to time request that Scotiabank issue an unspecified amount of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2019, we had $63.3 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Reimbursement Agreement.  Under the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse Scotiabank on demand for any amounts that Scotiabank has disbursed under any letters of credit. Fees, charges and other reasonable expenses for the issuance of letters of credit are payable by us at the time of issuance at such rates and amounts as are in accordance with Scotiabank’s prevailing practice. We are obligated to pay to Scotiabank interest on all amounts not paid on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum, calculated daily and payable monthly, in arrears, on the basis of a calendar year for the actual number of days elapsed, with interest on overdue interest at the same rate as on the reimbursement amounts.  We have also agreed that if obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on any of our subsidiaries’ property, then our reimbursement obligations and (to the extent similar obligations would be secured under the Credit Agreement) other obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement and any letters of credit will be equally and ratably secured by all property subject to such liens securing the Credit Agreement.  Pursuant to a Continuing Guaranty dated as of March 16, 2015, our payment obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed as to payment and not as to collection by our subsidiaries that from time to time guarantee payment under the Credit Agreement.  None of our subsidiaries are currently required to guarantee payment under the Credit Agreement.   42      Series A  Senior Notes and Series B  Senior Notes —   On October 5, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our Series A Notes in a private placement. The Series A Notes bore interest at a rate of 4.97% per annum. On September 25, 2019, we fully prepaid the Series A Notes. The total amount of the prepayment, including the applicable “make-whole” premium ,  was approximately $308 million, which represents 100% of the principal and the “make-whole” premium to the prepayment date.   On June 14, 2012, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our Series B Notes in a private placement. The Series B Notes bore interest at a rate of 4.27% per annum. On December 16, 2019, we fully prepaid  the Series B Notes. The total amount of the prepayment, including the applicable “make-whole” premium, was approximately $315 million, which represents 100% of the principal and the “make-whole” premium to the prepayment date.   As a result of the prepayments, we also recorded a $24.0 million loss on early debt extinguishment in 2019, which was included in “Interest expense, net of amount capitalized” in the consolidated statements of operations.  2028 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes —   On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes. The net proceeds before offering expenses were approximately $521 million, of which we used $239 million to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.  On  November 15, 2019, we completed an offering  of $350 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Notes.  The net proceeds before offering expenses were approximately $347 million, of which we used $315 million to repay in full our Series B Notes, and the remainder to repay a portion of the borrowings under the  Term Loan Agreement.    We pay interest on the 2028 Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 2028 Notes will mature on February 1, 2028. The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.95% per annum.  We pay interest on the 2029 Notes on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 2029 Notes will mature on November 15, 2029. The 2029 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.15% per annum.  The 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes (together, the “Senior Notes”)  are  senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our other future subordinated debt. The Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In addition, the Senior Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. None of our subsidiaries are currently required to be a guarantor under the Senior Notes. If our subsidiaries guarantee the Senior Notes in the future, such guarantees (the “Guarantees”) will rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors’ future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of the guarantors’ future subordinated debt. The Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any of the guarantors’ future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.   We, at our option, may redeem the Senior Notes in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal  amount  of such Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those Senior Notes to the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium. Additionally, commencing on November 1, 2027, in the case of the 2028 Notes, and on August 15, 2029, in the case of the 2029 Notes, we, at our option, may redeem the respective Senior Notes in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those Senior Notes to the redemption date.  The indentures pursuant to which the Senior Notes were issued include covenants that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to  incur  certain liens, engage in sale and lease-back transactions or consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of their assets. These covenants are subject to important qualifications and limitations set forth in the indentures.  Upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indentures, each holder of the Senior Notes may require us to purchase all or a  portion  of such holder’s Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.  The  indentures  also provide for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on the Senior Notes to become or to be declared due and payable.  43      Commitments   — As of December 31,  2019 , we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of  $63.4   million  primarily  for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for  retrospective premiums and  retained losses which could become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts. These letters of credit expire annually at various times during the year and are typically renewed.   As of December 31,  2019 , no amounts had been drawn under the letters of credit.    As of December 31, 2019, we had commitments to purchase major equipment and make investments totaling approximately $51 million for our drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals businesses.   Our pressure pumping business has entered into agreements to purchase minimum quantities of proppants and chemicals from certain vendors. The agreements expire in years 2020 through 2023. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining obligation under these agreements was approximately $37.8 million, of which approximately $15.8 million relates to purchases required during 2020. In the event the required minimum quantities are not purchased during any contract year, we could be required to make a liquidated damages payment to the respective vendor for any shortfall.   Trading and Investing  — We have not engaged in trading activities that include high-risk securities, such as derivatives and non-exchange traded contracts. We invest cash primarily in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits and money market accounts.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We had no off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2019.  44      Adjusted EBITDA   Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense (including impairment of goodwill). We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and a comparison of the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measure of net income (loss).  Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as other similarly titled measures of other companies.  Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of net income (loss).              Year Ended December 31,                 2019           2018           2017                 (Dollars in thousands)         Net income (loss)       $   (425,703   )       $   (321,421   )       $   5,910         Income tax benefit           (104,675   )           (45,987   )           (333,711   )     Net interest expense           69,191               45,981               35,606         Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment           1,003,873               916,318               783,341         Impairment of goodwill           17,800               211,129               —         Adjusted EBITDA       $   560,486           $   806,020           $   491,146        Critical Accounting Policies   In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition and the use of estimates.   Property and equipment  — Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis. No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.   On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring inactive rigs to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type. The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment. The remaining components of these rigs are retired. In 2019, we identified 36 legacy non-APEX® rigs and related equipment that would be retired. Based on the strong customer preference across the industry for super-spec drilling rigs, we believe the 36 rigs that were retired have limited commercial opportunity. We recorded a $173 million charge related to this retirement. In 2018, we identified 42 legacy non-APEX® rigs and related equipment that would be retired. Based on the strong customer preference across the industry for super-spec drilling rigs, we believe the 42 rigs that were retired had limited commercial opportunity. We recorded a $48.4 million charge related to this retirement. In 2017, we recorded a charge of $29.0 million for the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability.  We also periodically evaluate our pressure pumping assets for marketability based on the condition of inactive equipment, expenditures that would be necessary to bring the equipment to working condition and the expected demand. The components of equipment that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility will be used as parts to support active equipment. The remaining components of this equipment are retired. In 2019, we recorded a charge of $20.5 million for the write-down of pressure pumping equipment compared to a $17.4 million write-down of pressure pumping equipment in 2018. There was no similar charge in 2017.  We also periodically evaluate our directional drilling assets. During 2019, we recorded a charge of $8.4 million for the write-down of directional drilling equipment. There were no similar charges in 2018 or 2017.  We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives (“triggering   45      events”). In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.  We  estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in  our  assessment of impairment. These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as  our  expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future. Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset’s net book value. Any provision for impairment is measured at fair value.  2019 Triggering Event Assessment  Due to the decline in the market price of our common stock and recent commodity prices, our results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 and our expectations of operating results in future periods, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in certain of our operating segments. We deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals asset groups as of September 30, 2019. We performed an analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of the asset groups within our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals operating segments as of September 30, 2019. With respect to these asset groups, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the asset groups, and no impairment was indicated. Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the asset groups within the contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals operating segments by approximately 35%, 54%, 23% and 7%, respectively.   For the assessment performed in 2019, the expected cash flows for our asset groups included  revenue growth rates, operating expense growth rates, and terminal growth rates . Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals asset groups were based on the assumption that activity levels in all four segments would generally be lower than levels experienced in 2019 and would begin to recover in late 2020 or 2021 in response to improved oil prices. While we believe these assumptions with respect to future oil pricing are reasonable, actual future prices and activity levels may vary significantly from the ones that were assumed. The timeframe over which oil prices and activity levels may recover is highly uncertain. Potential events that could affect our assumptions regarding future prices and the timeframe for a recovery are affected by factors such as those described in “Risk Factors–We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas. Declines in Customers’ Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.”  All of these factors are beyond our control. If the lower oil price environment experienced in 2019 were to last into late 2021 and beyond, our actual cash flows would likely be less than the expected cash flows used in these assessments and could result in impairment charges in the future, and such impairment could be material.   We concluded that no triggering events occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 with respect to our asset groups based on our recent results of operations, management’s expectations of operating results in future periods and the prevailing commodity prices at the time.  Prior Year Triggering Event Assessment  Due to the decline in the market price of our common stock and the deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2018, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in certain of our operating segments. We deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals asset groups. We performed an analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of the asset groups within our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals operating segments as of December 31, 2018. With respect to these asset groups, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the asset groups, and no impairment was indicated. Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the asset groups within the contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals operating segments by approximately 38%, 58%, 9% and 23%, respectively.   For the assessment performed in 2018, the expected cash flows for our asset groups included  revenue growth rates, operating expense growth rates, and terminal growth rates . Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals asset groups were based on the assumption that activity levels in all four segments would generally be lower than levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018, and would begin to recover in late 2019 and continue into 2020 in response to improved oil prices and activity levels.   We concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 with respect to our asset groups based on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, our expectations of operating results in future periods and the prevailing commodity prices at the time.  Goodwill  — Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.  Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as of December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below   46      its carrying value. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.  Our  reporting units for impairment testing are  our  operating segments.  We  determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if this is the case, any necessary goodwill impairment is determined using a quantitative impairment test. From time to time,  we  may perform quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing the qualitative assessment. If the resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the shortfall.  Due to the decline in the market price of our common stock and recent commodity prices, our results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 and our expectations of operating results in future periods, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in certain of our operating segments. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill as of September 30, 2019. In completing the assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using the income approach. The estimate of fair value for each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement. The assumptions included discount rates, revenue growth rates, operating expense growth rates, and terminal growth rates.  Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2019, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 13% and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit; however, impairment was indicated in our oilfield rentals and electrical controls and automation reporting units included in the other operations segment. We recognized an impairment charge of $17.8 million in 2019 associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill in our oilfield rentals and electrical controls and automation reporting units.  The timeframe over which oil prices and activity levels may recover is highly uncertain. If the lower oil price environment experienced in 2019 were to last into late 2021 and beyond, our actual cash flows would likely be less than the expected cash flows used in these assessments and could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in the future and such impairment could be material.  Due to the decline in the market price of our common stock and the deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2018, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in certain of our operating segments. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2018. In completing the assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using the income approach. The estimate of fair value for each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.  The assumptions included discount rates, revenue growth rates, operating expense growth rates, and terminal growth rates.  Based on the results of the goodwill  impairment assessment as of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the contract drilling and oilfield rentals reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 16% and 14%, respectively, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling and oilfield rentals reporting units; however, impairment was indicated in our pressure pumping and directional drilling reporting units. We recognized an impairment charge of $211 million associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill in our pressure pumping and directional drilling reporting units.  In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2019 and 2017, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than the respective carrying amount. In making this determination, we considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in our reporting units, as well as our 2019 and 2017 operating results and forecasted operating results for the respective succeeding year. We also considered our overall market capitalization at December 31, 2019 and 2017.   Revenue recognition  — On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue guidance under Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not complete at December 31, 2017. The adoption of the new accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and a cumulative adjustment was not recognized. Revenues for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while revenues prior to January 1, 2018 continue to be reported under previous revenue recognition requirements of Topic 605.  Leases  — On January 1, 2019,  we adopted the new lease guidance under Topic 842,  Leases , using the modified retrospective approach to each lease that existed at the date of initial application as well as leases entered into after that date. We have elected to report all leases at the beginning of the period of adoption and not restate our comparative periods. This standard does not apply to leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources, including the intangible right to explore for those natural resources and rights to use the land in which those natural resources are contained. See Note 12 for  Notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.  Use of estimates  — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities   47      at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.   Actual results could differ from such estimates.    Key estimates used by management include:           •   allowance for doubtful accounts,           •   depreciation, depletion and amortization,           •   fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions,           •   goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and           •   reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.   For additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.   Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impact on Operations and Financial Condition   Our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices. For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile. Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control. Please see “Risk Factors – We are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas. Declines in Customers’ Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results” in Item 1A of this Report. Oil prices reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 per barrel in February 2016. Oil prices have recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016, and reached a high of $77.41 in June 2018. Oil prices remain volatile, as the closing price of oil began the year at a low of $46.31 per barrel on January 2, 2019, before increasing by 43% over the course of four months to reach a high of $66.24 per barrel in late April 2019.  Since May 2019, oil prices have generally ranged between $50 and $60 per barrel.  Oil prices averaged $56.94 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2019 and closed at $50.06 per barrel on February 3, 2020. U.S. rig counts increased in response to improved oil prices in early 2018. Despite oil prices in the $50s, drilling and pressure pumping activity declined in 2019, particularly toward the end of the year, largely as a result of reduced customer spending.  We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital. Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers’ expectations of future oil and natural gas prices, as well as our customers’ ability to access sources of capital to fund their operating and capital expenditures. A decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices, expectations of decreases in oil and natural gas prices or a reduction in the ability of our customers to access capital, would likely result in reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Even during periods of historically moderate or high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.  Impact of Inflation   Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2019. We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards   For a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.   Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   As of December 31, 2019,  we had exposure to interest rate market risk associated with our borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement, and we would have had exposure to interest rate market risk associated with any borrowings that we had under the Credit Agreement and amounts owed under the Reimbursement Agreement.  Loans under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate. The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 1.00% to 1.375%, and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 0.00% to 0.375%, in each case determined based upon our credit rating. As of December 31, 2019, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans and base rate loans was 1.125% and 0.125%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had $100 million in borrowings outstanding under the   48      Term Loan Agreement at a  weighted average  interest rate of  2.917 % .   A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of  December  3 1 , 2019 would increase our annual cash interest expense by $1. 0  million .  Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate. The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 1.00% to 2.00% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 0.00% to 1.00%, in each case determined based on our credit rating. As of December 31, 2019, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 1.50% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 0.50%. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility is variable and adjusts at each interest payment date based on our election of LIBOR or the base rate.  Under the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse Scotiabank on demand for any amounts that Scotiabank has disbursed under any letters of credit. We are obligated to pay Scotiabank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum. As of December 31, 2019, no amounts had been disbursed under any letters of credit.  We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars. The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years. If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars. This currency risk is not material to our financial condition or results of operations.   The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.   Item 8.
