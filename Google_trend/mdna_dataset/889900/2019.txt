On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.95% Senior Notes due 2028  (the “2028 Notes”) .  We used $239 million of the net proceeds from the sale to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.    On October 11, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of MS Directional, LLC  (f/k/a Multi-Shot, LLC) (“MS Directional”).   MS Directional is a leading directional drilling services company in the United States, with operations in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins.  MS Directional provides a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services, including directional drilling, downhole performance motors, motor rentals, directional surveying, measurement-while-drilling, and wireline steering tools.  Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the MS Directional business in our directional drilling segment since October 11, 2017.  On April 20, 2017, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “merger agreement”) with Seventy Seven Energy Inc. (“SSE”), a subsidiary of ours was merged with and into SSE (the “SSE merger”), with SSE continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.  On April 20, 2017, following the SSE merger, SSE was merged with and into our newly-formed subsidiary named Seventy Seven Energy LLC (“SSE LLC”), with SSE LLC continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Through the SSE merger, we acquired a fleet of 91 drilling rigs, 36 of which we consider to be APEX® rigs. Additionally, through the SSE merger, we acquired approximately 500,000 horsepower of fracturing equipment located in Oklahoma and Texas.  The oilfield rentals business acquired through the SSE merger has a fleet of premium oilfield rental tools and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities. Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the SSE business since April 20, 2017.  Management Overview  — We are a Houston, Texas-based oilfield services company that primarily owns and operates in the United States one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment.  Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and western Canada , and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America .  Our pressure pumping business operates primarily in Texas and the Mid-Continent and Appalachian regions.  We also provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States, and we provide services that improve the statistical accuracy of horizontal wellbore placement.  We have other operations through which we provide oilfield rental tools in select markets in the United States. We also manufacture and sell pipe handling components and related technology to drilling contractors, and provide electrical controls and automation to the energy, marine and mining industries, in North America and other select markets.  In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.    The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.  Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.  Oil prices have recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016.  Oil prices reached a high of $77.41 in June 2018.  Oil prices remain volatile, as the closing price of oil reached a fourth quarter 2018 high of $76.40 per barrel on October 3, 2018, before declining by 42% over the course of three months to reach a low of $44.48 per barrel in late December 2018.  Oil prices averaged $59.08 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018.    28      Quarterly average oil prices and  our  quarterly average number of rigs operating in the United States for 2016, 2017, and 2018 are as follows:                                  1 st           2 nd           3 rd           4 th                 Quarter           Quarter           Quarter           Quarter         2016:                                                                     Average oil price per Bbl  (1)       $   33.18           $   45.41           $   44.85           $   49.15         Average rigs operating per day - U.S.  (2)           71               55               60               66         2017:                                                                     Average oil price per Bbl  (1)       $   51.77           $   48.24           $   48.16           $   55.37         Average rigs operating per day - U.S.  (2)           81               145               159               159         2018:                                                                     Average oil price per Bbl  (1)       $   62.88           $   68.04           $   69.76           $   59.08         Average rigs operating per day - U.S.  (2)           166               175               177               182                                 (1)   The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.      (2)   A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.  Our rig count declined significantly during the industry downturn that began in late 2014 but has improved since the second quarter of 2016.  Our average rig count for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 183 rigs, which included 182 rigs in the United States and one rig in Canada.  This was an increase from our average rig count for the third quarter of 2018 of 178 rigs, which included 177 rigs in the United States and one rig in Canada.  Our rig count in the United States at December 31, 2018 of 183 rigs was greater than the rig count of 163 rigs at December 31, 2017.  Term contracts have supported our operating rig count during the last three years.  Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 122 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter of 2019 and an average of 78 rigs operating under term contracts throughout 2019.  With the weakness in crude oil prices late in the fourth quarter, operators have been delaying starting new completion projects in the first quarter, and pricing remains extremely competitive.  As such, we have made the decision to idle spreads rather than work at unreasonably low prices.  We ended the fourth quarter with 20 active spreads and idled three spreads early in the first quarter of 2019 .       Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.  During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services.  Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens, and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.  The North American oil and natural gas services industry is cyclical and at times experiences downturns in demand.  During these periods, there has been substantially more oil and natural gas service equipment available than necessary to meet demand.  As a result, oil and natural gas service contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins and, at times, have incurred losses during the downturn periods.  Currently, there is an excess of drilling rigs that are not super-spec, pressure pumping equipment and directional drilling equipment available. In circumstances of excess capacity, providers of oil and natural gas services have difficulty sustaining profit margins and may sustain losses during downturn periods. We cannot predict either the future level of demand for our oil and natural gas services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas service businesses.  We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues, weather, the availability of products in our pressure pumping business, supplier delays and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  Please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report.      For the three years ended December 31, 2018, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):               2018           2017           2016         Contract drilling       $   1,430,492               43.0   %       $   1,040,033               44.1   %       $   543,663               59.4   %     Pressure pumping           1,573,396               47.3   %           1,200,311               50.9   %           354,070               38.7   %     Directional drilling           209,275               6.3   %           45,580               1.9   %           —               —   %     Other           113,834               3.4   %           70,760               3.1   %           18,133               1.9   %             $   3,326,997               100.0   %       $   2,356,684               100.0   %       $   915,866               100.0   %    Contract Drilling  Contract drilling operations accounted for 43.0% of our consolidated 2018 revenues, and contract drilling revenues increased 37.5% over 2017.   We have addressed our customers’ needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years.  The U.S. land rig industry refers to certain high specification rigs as “super-spec” rigs.  We consider a super-spec rig to be at least a 1,500 horsepower, AC powered rig   29      that has a 750,000 - pound hookload, a 7,500 - psi circulating system ,  and is pad - capable.  As of December 31,  2018 , our rig fleet included  198  APEX ®  rigs , of which  149  were super-spec rigs.   W e delivered  14  rigs with major upg rades  in 2018 and one additional major  rig  upgrade in January 2019 .    We currently have one additional major rig upgrade contracted for delivery in 2019.  We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more.  Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $770 million and $544 million, respectively.  Approximately 23% of the total contract drilling backlog at December 31, 2018 is reasonably expected to remain after 2019.  We generally calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract.  The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, other than initial mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract.  For contracts that contain variable dayrate pricing, our backlog calculation uses the dayrate in effect for periods where the dayrate is fixed, and, for periods that remain subject to variable pricing, uses the commodity price in effect at December 31, 2018.  In addition, our term drilling contracts are generally subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.  For contracts on which we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate, for the period over which we expect to receive the lower rate.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.”  Ongoing factors which could continue to adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:          •   movement of drilling rigs from region to region,          •   reactivation of drilling rigs,          •   refurbishment and upgrades of existing drilling rigs,           •   development of new technologies that enhance drilling efficiency,          •   construction of new technology drilling rigs.   Pressure Pumping  Pressure pumping operations accounted for 47.3% of our consolidated 2018 revenues, and pressure pumping revenues increased 31.1% over 2017.  As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1.6 million horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet.  In response to unreasonably low prices in the completions market, we reduced the number of active frac spreads to 20 as of the end of the fourth quarter and idled three spreads early in the first quarter of 2019.    Directional Drilling  Directional drilling operations accounted for 6.3% of our consolidated 2018 revenues. Activity for directional drilling commenced with the acquisition of MS Directional in October 2017, which provides a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States.  Our directional drilling services include directional drilling, downhole performance motors, motor rentals, directional surveying, measurement-while-drilling, and wireline steering tools, and we provide services that improve the statistical accuracy of horizontal wellbore placement.  Other Operations  Other operations revenues accounted for 3.4% of our consolidated 2018 revenues, and our other operations revenues increased 60.9% over 2017.  Our oilfield rentals business, which was acquired with the SSE merger, provides the largest revenue contribution to our other operations.  Our oilfield rentals business has a fleet of premium oilfield rental tools and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities.  Other operations also includes the results of our electrical controls and automation business, the results of our pipe handling components and related technology business, and the results of our ownership,  as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.  Capital Expenditures  Cash capital expenditures for 2018 totaled $641 million.  For 2019, based on near-term activity levels, we expect cash used for capital expenditures to be approximately $465 million.     30      For the three years ended December 31,  2018 , our operating income (loss) consisted of the following (dollars in thousand s):               2018           2017           2016         Contract drilling       $   (33,115   )           10.3   %       $   (171,897   )           58.8   %       $   (235,858   )           51.7   %     Pressure pumping           (77,328   )           24.0   %           21,028               (7.2   )%           (176,628   )           38.7   %     Directional drilling           (117,497   )           36.5   %           (21   )           —   %           —               —   %     Other           (18,221   )           5.7   %           (20,813   )           7.1   %           (3,391   )           0.7   %     Corporate           (76,016   )           23.5   %           (120,835   )           41.3   %           (40,349   )           8.9   %             $   (322,177   )           100.0   %       $   (292,538   )           100.0   %       $   (456,226   )           100.0   %    Discussion of our operating income (loss) follows in the “Results of Operations” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  While demand for our contract drilling and pressure pumping services improved in 2018 and merger and integration expenses were lower, an impairment of goodwill and write-downs to drilling and pressure pumping equipment contributed to a consolidated net loss of $321 million for 2018, compared to consolidated net income of $5.9 million for 2017 and a consolidated net loss of $319 million for 2016.  Our net income for 2017 was positive due to the 2017 tax law change.

Our average revenue per operating day is largely dependent on the pricing terms of our rig contracts.      Revenues and direct operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in operating days.  Operating days and average rigs operating increased in 2018 primarily due to the recovery in the oil and natural gas industry, the contribution of rigs acquired in the SSE merger and the contribution from rigs that have been upgraded to super-spec capability.  Capital expenditures increased in 2018 due to the upgrade of rigs to super-spec capability, higher maintenance capital expenditures and other equipment upgrades. Depreciation, amortization, and impairment for 2018 included a charge of $48.4 million related to the retirement of 42 legacy non-APEX® rigs and related equipment.  Based on the strong customer preference across the industry for super-spec drilling rigs, we believe the 42 rigs that were retired had limited commercial opportunity.  Depreciation, amortization, and impairment for 2017 included a charge of $29.0 million for the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability.   31                                     Year Ended December 31,         Pressure Pumping       2018           2017           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   1,573,396           $   1,200,311               31.1   %     Direct operating costs           1,263,850               966,835               30.7   %     Margin  (1)           309,546               233,476               32.6   %     Selling, general and administrative           15,420               14,442               6.8   %     Depreciation, amortization and impairment           250,010               198,006               26.3   %     Impairment of goodwill           121,444               —           NA         Operating income (loss)       $   (77,328   )       $   21,028           NA         Fracturing jobs           812               622               30.5   %     Other jobs           1,081               1,262               (14.3   )%     Total jobs           1,893               1,884               0.5   %     Average revenue per fracturing job       $   1,909.42           $   1,894.40               0.8   %     Average revenue per other job       $   21.23           $   17.43               21.8   %     Average revenue per total job       $   831.17           $   637.11               30.5   %     Average direct operating costs per total job       $   667.64           $   513.18               30.1   %     Average margin per total job  (1)       $   163.52           $   123.93               31.9   %     Margin as a percentage of revenues  (1)           19.7   %           19.5   %           1.0   %     Capital expenditures       $   173,848           $   171,436               1.4   %                         (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.  Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs.  Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues.       Generally, the revenues in our pressure pumping segment are most impacted by our number of fracturing jobs and the size (including whether or not we provide proppant and other materials) of those jobs, which is reflected in our average revenue per   fracturing job.  We completed 812 fracturing jobs during 2018 compared to 622 fracturing jobs in 2017.  Our average revenue per fracturing job was $1.909 million in 2018 compared to $1.894 million in 2017.     Revenues and direct operating costs in 2018 increased primarily due to an increase in the number of fracturing jobs. Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense increased due to the assets acquired in the SSE merger. Also included in depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2018 is a charge of $17.4 million related to the write-down of obsolete sand-handling equipment. There was no similar charge in the comparable period of 2017.  All of the goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business was impaired during 2018.  See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.                                 Year Ended December 31,         Directional Drilling       2018           2017           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   209,275           $   45,580               359.1   %     Direct operating costs           175,829               32,172               446.5   %     Margin  (1)           33,446               13,408               149.4   %     Selling, general and administrative           15,941               4,082               290.5   %     Depreciation and amortization           45,317               9,347               384.8   %     Impairment of goodwill           89,685               —           NA         Operating loss       $   (117,497   )       $   (21   )       NA         Capital expenditures       $   35,929           $   7,795               360.9   %                         (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses.    Our directional drilling segment originated with the October 11, 2017 acquisition of MS Directional, and consequently the results for 2017 include less than three months of operations.  Margins in 2018 were negatively impacted by higher third-party rental expenses due to delays in the delivery of equipment and by higher repairs and maintenance costs.  All of the goodwill associated with our directional drilling business was impaired during 2018.  See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.    32                                                Year Ended December 31,         Other Operations       2018           2017           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   113,834           $   70,760               60.9   %     Direct operating costs           77,104               51,428               49.9   %     Margin  (1)           36,730               19,332               90.0   %     Selling, general and administrative           13,439               10,743               25.1   %     Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment           41,512               29,402               41.2   %     Operating loss       $   (18,221   )       $   (20,813   )           (12.5   )%     Capital expenditures       $   34,660           $   31,547               9.9   %                          (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.   Revenues, direct operating costs, and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense from other operations increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of our oilfield rentals business acquired in the SSE merger on April 20, 2017.  The increase in capital expenditures was due to investments in the oilfield rentals business.              Year Ended December 31,         Corporate       2018           2017           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Selling, general and administrative       $   82,975           $   70,646               17.5   %     Merger and integration expenses       $   2,738           $   74,451               (96.3   )%     Depreciation       $   7,872           $   7,695               2.3   %     Other operating (income) expense, net                                                     Net gain on asset disposals           (28,958   )           (33,510   )           (13.6   )%     Legal-related expenses and settlements, net of insurance reimbursements           12,684               561           NA         Research and development           3,444               1,002               243.7   %     Other           (4,739   )           (10   )       NA         Other operating income, net       $   (17,569   )       $   (31,957   )           (45.0   )%     Interest income       $   5,597           $   1,866               199.9   %     Interest expense       $   51,578           $   37,472               37.6   %     Other income       $   750           $   343               118.7   %     Capital expenditures       $   2,426           $   1,884               28.8   %    Selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2018, but as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 2.5%, compared to 3.0% in 2017.  Selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2018 primarily due to the personnel added as a result of the SSE merger.  Merger and integration expenses incurred in 2018 are related to the SSE merger, the MS Directional acquisition and the Superior QC acquisition.  Merger and integration expenses incurred in 2017 are related to the SSE merger and the MS Directional acquisition.  Other operating income includes net gains associated with the disposal of assets.  Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been excluded from the results of specific segments. The majority of the net gain on asset disposals during the 2018 period reflects gains on disposal of drilling equipment. The 2017 period included a gain of $11.2 million related to the sale of real estate.  Legal-related expenses and settlements in 2018 includes insurance deductibles and investigation costs related to an accident at a drilling site in January 2018.  Research and development expense during 2018 and 2017 relate primarily to the funding of research into pressure pumping technology.  Other operating income during 2018 also includes the gain on the collection of a note receivable that had previously been discounted.  Interest income increased in 2018 due to interest earned on the portion of the proceeds of the January 2018 debt offering that were held as cash during 2018.  The debt offering also resulted in an increase in interest expense for 2018.   33      Comparison of the years ended De cember 31,  2017  and  2016    The following tables summarize results of operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:                               Year Ended December 31,         Contract Drilling       2017           2016           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   1,040,033           $   543,663               91.3   %     Direct operating costs           667,105               305,804               118.1   %     Margin  (1)           372,928               237,859               56.8   %     Selling, general and administrative           5,934               5,743               3.3   %     Depreciation, amortization and impairment           538,891               467,974               15.2   %     Operating loss       $   (171,897   )       $   (235,858   )           (27.1   )%     Operating days           50,427               23,596               113.7   %     Average revenue per operating day       $   20.62           $   23.04               (10.5   )%     Average direct operating costs per operating day       $   13.23           $   12.96               2.1   %     Average margin per operating day  (1)       $   7.40           $   10.08               (26.6   )%     Average rigs operating       $   138.2           $   64.5               114.3   %     Capital expenditures       $   354,425           $   72,508               388.8   %                         (1)   Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.  Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days.    Revenues and direct operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in operating days.  Operating days and average rigs operating increased due to a recovery in the oil and natural gas industry and the rigs acquired in the SSE merger.  Depreciation, amortization and impairment increased due to the additional SSE assets and due to a $29.0 million impairment from the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability. There was no similar charge in 2016. Average revenue per operating day decreased during 2017 due to a reduction in early termination revenue and the expiration of higher day rate, legacy long-term rig contracts.   Many of our higher day rate, legacy long-term rig contracts were entered into during periods of higher demand, and as a result, these legacy contracts had a higher day rate on average relative to the more recent contracts pursuant to which work was performed during 2017.  The majority of these legacy contracts expired during the recent downturn prior to and during 2017, and as a result we experienced a lower average revenue per operating day during 2017 relative to 2016.   Early termination revenue in 2017 was $4.9 million, compared to $24.6 million in 2016.  Average direct operating costs per operating day increased as a result of a reduction in the proportion of rigs on standby and an increase in rig reactivation expenses.  Capital expenditures increased due to the upgrade of rigs to super-spec capability, building a new rig, higher maintenance capital expenditures and other general property and equipment upgrades.                               Year Ended December 31,         Pressure

increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of our oilfield rentals business acquired in the SSE merger on April 20, 2017 and our pipe handling components and related technology business acquired in September 2016.  The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to investments in the oilfield rentals business and in oil and natural gas working interests.               Year Ended

includes net gains associated with the disposal of assets.  Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been excluded from the results   35      of specific segments. The 2017 period includes a gain of $11.2 million related to the sale of real e state and $8.4 million from the sale of certain oil and gas properties.  Interest income increased due to our investment of the proceeds from our stock offering in the first quarter of 2017 prior to utilizing those proceeds to repay SSE indebtedness.  Inte rest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt outstanding during 2017 compared to 2016.

Also impacting the 2018 effective tax rate are certain goodwill impairment charges, which are not deductible for tax purposes, and valuation allowances being established against deferred tax assets in certain state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The goodwill impairment and valuation allowances resulted in a 6.9% and 3.7% decrease in the effective tax rate, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by a 2.3% increase in the effective tax rate following the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for state tax purposes.         Tax Reform includes, among other things, a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning 2018, a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, expensing of certain capital investments, and reducing the amount of executive pay that will be tax deductible. Tax Reform also makes fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational entities, including a shift from worldwide taxation with deferral to a hybrid territorial system, a minimum tax on certain low-taxed foreign earnings, and new measures to deter base erosion and promote export sales from the United States. For December 31, 2017, we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of Tax Reform by applying the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) because we had not yet completed our enactment-date accounting for these effects. In 2017, we recorded approximately $219 million of tax benefit related to the enactment-date effects of Tax Reform that related solely to adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new U.S. federal corporate tax rate at which they are expected to reverse. After filing our 2017 income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of Tax Reform. As a result, we recognized $4.6 million of tax expense as an adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017 and included these adjustments as a component of income tax expense. The changes to 2017 enactment-date provisional amounts decreased the effective tax rate in 2018 by 1.3%.   Prior to Tax Reform, we had elected to permanently reinvest unremitted earnings in Canada effective January 1, 2010, and we intend to do so for the foreseeable future.  If we were to repatriate earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to certain income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable.    We record deferred income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled.  As a result of recognizing the benefit of deferred income taxes, we incur   36      deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilize d.  We recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately $41.2 million in 2018, $330 million in 2017 and $152 million in 2016.    Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our liquidity as of December 31, 2018 included approximately $424 million in working capital, including $245 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $600 million available under our revolving credit facility.    On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes.  We used $239 million of the net proceeds from the sale to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.  As described below, on March 27, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which is a committed senior unsecured revolving credit facility that permits  aggregate borrowings of up to $600 million, including a letter of credit facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $20 million.  We believe our current liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to maintain and make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends for at least the next 12 months.  If we pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash flows from operating activities, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or additional debt or equity financing.  However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.    As of December 31, 2018, we had working capital of $424 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $245 million, compared to working capital of $201 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $42.8 million, at December 31, 2017.    During 2018, our sources of cash flow included:           •    $731 million from operating activities,           •    $47.4 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment,          •    $23.8 million from collection of a note receivable, and          •    $521 million from proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.  During 2018, we used $268 million to repay net borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $14.2 million for acquisitions, $30.6 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $4.5 million for debt issuance costs, $162 million for the repurchases of our common stock and $641 million:           •   to make capital expenditures for the acquisition, betterment and refurbishment of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment,          •   to acquire and procure equipment and facilities to support our drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling, oilfield rentals and manufacturing operations, and           •   to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis.    We paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2018 as follows:               Per Share           Total                                 (in thousands)         Paid on March 22, 2018       $   0.02           $   4,443         Paid on June 21, 2018           0.04               8,832         Paid on September 20, 2018           0.04               8,685         Paid on December 20, 2018           0.04               8,629         Total cash dividends       $   0.14           $   30,589        On February 6, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.04 per share to be paid on March 21, 2019 to holders of record as of March 7, 2019.  The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our debt agreements and other factors.    37      On September 6, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program that authorize d  purchase s  of up to $200 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.  On July 25, 2018,  our  Board of Directors approved  an increase of the authorization under the stock buyback program to allow for $250 million of future share repurchases.     All purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions.  Purchases under the program are made at management’s disc retion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors.    Purchases may be made at any time without prior notice.    Shares of stock purchased under the plan are held as treasury shares.  There is no expiration date associated with the b uyback program.    As of December 31,  2018 , we had remaining authorization to purchase approximately  $150   million of our outstanding common stock under  the  stock buyback program.   On February 6, 2019, our Board of Directors approved another increase of the a uthorization under the stock buyback program to allow for $250 million of future share repurchases.  We acquired shares of stock from directors in 2017 and 2016 and from employees during 2018, 2017 and 2016 that are accounted for as treasury stock.  Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price in connection with the exercise of stock options.  The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll withholding obligations upon the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units.  These shares were acquired at fair market value.  These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan and not pursuant to the stock buyback program.    Treasury stock acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):               2018           2017           2016                 Shares           Cost           Shares           Cost           Shares           Cost         Treasury shares at beginning of period           43,802,611           $   918,711               43,392,617           $   911,094               43,207,240           $   907,045         Purchases pursuant to stock buyback program           9,331,131               150,497               5,503               109               8,488               183         Acquisitions pursuant to long-term incentive plan           567,354               11,240               404,491               7,508               176,889               3,866         Treasury shares at end of period           53,701,096           $   1,080,448               43,802,611           $   918,711               43,392,617           $   911,094        2018 Credit Agreement    —   On March 27, 2018, we  entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) among us,  as  borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, letter of credit issuer, swing line lender and lender, each of the other lenders and letter of credit issuers party thereto, The Bank of Nova Scotia and U.S. Bank National Association, as Co-Syndication Agents, Royal Bank of Canada, as Documentation Agent and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, The Bank of Nova Scotia and U.S. Bank National Association, as Co-Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Runners.     The Credit Agreement is a committed senior unsecured revolving credit facility that permits aggregate borrowings of up to $600 million, including a letter of credit facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $20 million.  Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders’ aggregate commitments be increased by up to $300 million, not to exceed total commitments of $900 million.  The maturity date under the Credit Agreement is March 27, 2023.  We have the option, subject to certain conditions, to exercise two one-year extensions of the maturity date.  Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate.  The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 1.00% to 2.00% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 0.00% to 1.00%, in each case determined based upon our credit rating.  A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the daily amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit.  The commitment fee rate payable to the lenders varies from 0.10% to 0.30% based on our credit rating.  None of our subsidiaries are currently required to be a guarantor under the Credit Agreement.  However, if any subsidiary guarantees or incurs debt in excess of the Priority Debt Basket (as defined in the Credit Agreement), such subsidiary is required to become a guarantor under the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default and associated remedies that we believe are customary for agreements of this nature, including certain restrictions on our ability and each of our subsidiaries to incur debt and grant liens.  If our credit rating is below investment grade, we will become subject to a restricted payment covenant, which would require us to have a Pro Forma Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00 immediately before and immediately after making any restricted payment.  The Credit Agreement also requires that our total debt to capitalization ratio, expressed as a percentage, not exceed 50%.  The Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.    As of December 31, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.  We had $81,000 in letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018 and, as a result, had available borrowing capacity of approximately $600 million at that date.    38      2015 Reimbursement Agreement  — On March 16, 2015,  we  entered into a Reimbursement Agreement (the “Reimbursement Agreement”) with The Bank of Nova Scotia (“Sc otiabank”), pursuant to which  we  may fro m time to time request that Scotiabank issue an unspecified amount of letters of credit.  As of December 31,  2018 ,  we  had  $58.4   million in letters of credit outstanding under the Reimbursement Agreement.  Under the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse Scotiabank on demand for any amounts that Scotiabank has disbursed under any letters of credit.  Fees, charges and other reasonable expenses for the issuance of letters of credit are payable by us at the time of issuance at such rates and amounts as are in accordance with Scotiabank’s prevailing practice.  We are obligated to pay to Scotiabank interest on all amounts not paid on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum, calculated daily and payable monthly, in arrears, on the basis of a calendar year for the actual number of days elapsed, with interest on overdue interest at the same rate as on the reimbursement amounts.  We have also agreed that if obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on any of our subsidiaries’ property, then our reimbursement obligations and (to the extent similar obligations would be secured under the Credit Agreement) other obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement and any letters of credit will be equally and ratably secured by all property subject to such liens securing the Credit Agreement.  Pursuant to a Continuing Guaranty dated as of March 16, 2015 (the “Continuing Guaranty”), our payment obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed as to payment and not as to collection by our subsidiaries that from time to time guarantee payment under the Credit Agreement.  None of our subsidiaries are currently required to guarantee payment under the Credit Agreement.  Series A & B Senior Notes —   On October 5, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 5, 2020 (the “Series A Notes”) in a private placement.  The Series A Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.97% per annum.  We pay interest on the Series A Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year.  The Series A Notes will mature on October 5, 2020.    On June 14, 2012, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.27% Series B Senior Notes due June 14, 2022 (the “Series B Notes”) in a private placement.  The Series B Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.27% per annum.  We pay interest on the Series B Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year.  The Series B Notes will mature on June 14, 2022.    The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are senior unsecured obligations which rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsubordinated indebtedness.  The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our domestic subsidiaries other than subsidiaries that are not required to be guarantors under the Credit Agreement. None of our subsidiaries are currently required to be a guarantor under the Credit Agreement.  The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are prepayable at our option, in whole or in part, provided that in the case of a partial prepayment, prepayment must be in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, at any time and from time to time at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date, plus a “make-whole” premium as specified in the note purchase agreements.  We must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of any change of control.  In addition, we must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions if the proceeds therefrom are not timely reinvested in productive assets.  If any offer to prepay is accepted, the purchase price of each prepaid note is 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the prepayment date.    The respective note purchase agreements require compliance with two financial covenants.  We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 50% at any time.  The note purchase agreements generally define the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.  We also must not permit our interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.00.  The note purchase agreements generally define the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period.  We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2018.  We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.  Events of default under the note purchase agreements include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, a cross default event, a judgment in excess of a threshold event, the guaranty agreement ceasing to be enforceable, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, a change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.  If an event of default under the note purchase agreements occurs and is continuing, then holders of a majority in principal amount of the respective notes have the right to declare all the notes then-outstanding to be immediately due and payable.  In addition, if we default in payments on any note, then until such defaults are cured, the holder thereof may declare all the notes held by it pursuant to the note purchase agreement to be immediately due and payable.    39      2028 Senior Notes —   On January 19, 2018,  we  completed  an  offering  of $525 million aggregate principal amount of  our  2028 Notes .   T he net proceeds  before offering expenses  were  approximately $521 million ,  of which  we  used $239 million  to r epay amounts outstanding under  our  revolving credit facility.    We pay interest on the 2028 Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year.  The 2028 Notes will mature on February 1, 2028.  The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.95% per annum.  The 2028 Notes  are  senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our other future subordinated debt.  The 2028 Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.  In addition, the 2028 Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2028 Notes.  None of our subsidiaries are currently required to be a guarantor under the 2028 Notes.  If our subsidiaries guarantee the 2028 Notes in the future, such guarantees (the “Guarantees”) will rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors’ future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of the guarantors’ future subordinated debt.  The Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any of the guarantors’ future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.    We, at our option, may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal  amount  of such 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those 2028 Notes to the redemption date, plus a make-whole premium.  Additionally, commencing on November 1, 2027, we, at our option, may redeem the 2028 Notes in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those 2028 Notes to the redemption date.  The indenture pursuant to which the 2028 Notes were issued includes covenants that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to  incur  certain liens, engage in sale and lease-back transactions or consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.  These covenants are subject to important qualifications and limitations set forth in the indenture.  Upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, each holder of the 2028 Notes may require us to purchase all or a  portion  of such holder’s 2028 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.  The  indenture  also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on the 2028 Notes to become or to be declared due and payable.  Commitments  — As of December 31, 2018, we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $58.5 million primarily for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which could become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts.  These letters of credit expire annually at various times during the year and are typically renewed.  As of December 31, 2018, no amounts had been drawn under the letters of credit.    As of December 31, 2018, we had commitments to purchase major equipment and make investments totaling approximately $107 million for our drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals businesses.    Our pressure pumping business has entered into agreements to purchase minimum quantities of proppants and chemicals from certain vendors.  The agreements expire in years 2019 through 2022 and in 2043.  As of December 31, 2018, the remaining obligation under these agreements was approximately $114 million, of which approximately $24.7 million relates to purchases required during 2019.  In the event the required minimum quantities are not purchased during any contract year, we could be required to make a liquidated damages payment to the respective vendor for any shortfall.    40      Trading and Investing  — We have not engaged in trading activities that incl ude high-risk securities, such as derivatives and non-exchange traded contracts.  We invest cash primarily in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits and money market accounts.    Contractual Obligations   The following table presents information with respect to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):               Payments due by period                 Total           Less than 1 year           1-3 years           3-5 years           More than 5 years         Series A Notes  (1)       $   300,000               —               300,000               —           $   —         Interest on Series A Notes  (2)           29,820               14,910               14,910               —               —         Series B Notes  (3)           300,000               —               —               300,000               —         Interest on Series B Notes  (4)           47,292               12,810               25,620               8,862               —         2028 Notes  (5)           525,000               —               —               —               525,000         Interest on 2028 Notes  (6)           197,006               20,737               41,475               41,475               93,319         Leases  (7)           40,860               11,408               15,612               7,288               6,552         Equipment purchases  (8)           107,088               107,088               —               —               —         Inventory purchases  (9)           114,174               24,725               20,583               5,533               63,333         Total       $   1,661,240           $   191,678           $   418,200           $   363,158           $   688,204                           (1)   Principal repayment of the Series A Notes is required at maturity on October 5, 2020.        (2)   Interest to be paid on the Series A Notes using 4.97% coupon rate.        (3)   Principal repayment of the Series B Notes is required at maturity on June 14, 2022.

Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as other similarly titled measures of other companies.   Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of net income (loss).              Year Ended December 31,                 2018           2017           2016                 (Dollars in thousands)         Net income (loss)       $   (321,421   )       $   5,910           $   (318,634   )     Income tax benefit           (45,987   )           (333,711   )           (177,562   )     Net interest expense           45,981               35,606               40,039         Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment           916,318               783,341               668,434         Impairment of goodwill           211,129               —               —         Adjusted EBITDA       $   806,020           $   491,146           $   212,277        41      Critical Accounting Policies   In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.  The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.    Property and equipment  — Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.  We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.  Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.  No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.    On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type.  The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.  The remaining components of these rigs are retired.   During 2018, we identified 42 legacy non-APEX® rigs and related equipment that would be retired.  Based on the strong customer preference across the industry for super-spec drilling rigs, we believe the 42 rigs that were retired had limited commercial opportunity.  In 2018, we recorded a charge of $48.4 million related to this retirement. In 2017, we  recorded a charge of $29.0 million for the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability.   In 2016, we retired 19 mechanical rigs but recorded no charge as we had written down mechanical rigs that were still marketed in 2015.     We also periodically evaluate our pressure pumping assets, and in 2018, we recorded a charge of $17.4 million for the write-down of pressure pumping equipment.   The pressure pumping equipment was primarily obsolete sand handling equipment, which has been replaced with more efficient sand solutions.   There were no similar charges in 2017 or 2016.  In addition, we review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives (“triggering events”).  In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.  We estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment.  These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as our expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.  Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset’s net book value.  Any provision for impairment is measured at fair value.  Due to the decline in the market price of our common stock and the deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2018, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in certain of our operating segments.  Management deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals asset groups.  We performed an analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of the asset groups within our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals operating segments.  With respect to these asset groups, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the asset groups, and no impairment was indicated.  Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the asset groups within the contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals operating segments by approximately 38%, 58%, 9% and 23%, respectively.    For the assessment performed in 2018, the expected cash flows for our asset groups included utilization , revenue and costs for our equipment and services that were estimated based upon our existing contract backlog, as well as recent contract tenders and customer inquiries.  Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals asset groups were based on the assumption that activity levels in all four segments would generally be lower than levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018, and would begin to recover in late 2019 and continue into 2020 in response to improved oil prices.   While we believe these assumptions with respect to future oil pricing are reasonable, actual future prices may vary significantly from the ones that were assumed.  The timeframe over which oil prices will recover is highly uncertain.  Potential events that could affect our assumptions regarding future prices and the timeframe for a recovery are affected by factors such as those described in “Risk Factors–We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.  Declines in Customers’ Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.”  All of these factors are beyond our control. If the lower oil price environment experienced at the end of 2018 were to last into 2020 and beyond, our actual cash flows would likely be less than the expected cash flows used in these assessments and could result in impairment charges in the future and such impairment could be material.    We concluded that no triggering events occurred during the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016 with respect to our asset groups based on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our expectations of operating results in future periods and the prevailing commodity prices at the time.           42      Goodwill  — Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.   Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as of December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased  below its carrying value.  For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.  Our reporting units for impairment testing  are  our operating segments.  We  determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value o f a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if this is the case, any necessary goodwill impairment is determined using a quantitative impairment test.  From time to time, we may perform qu antitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing the qualitative assessment.  If the resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the shortfall.  Due to the decline in the market price of our common stock and the deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2018, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in certain of our operating segments. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2018.  In completing the assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using the income valuation method.  The estimate of fair value for each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.  The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals reporting units, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates and long-term growth rates.  Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the contract drilling and oilfield rentals reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 16% and 14%, respectively, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling and oilfield rentals reporting units; however, impairment was indicated in our pressure pumping and directional drilling reporting units.  We recognized an impairment charge of $211 million associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill in our pressure pumping and directional drilling reporting units.     While management believes the assumptions used with respect to future oil pricing are reasonable, actual future prices may vary significantly from the ones that were assumed.  The timeframe over which oil prices will recover is highly uncertain.  If the lower oil price environment  experienced at the end of 2018  were to last into 2020 and beyond, our actual cash flows would likely be less than the expected cash flows used in these assessments and could result in additional impairment charges in the future and such impairment could be material.    In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than the respective carrying amount.  In making this determination, we considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in our reporting units, as well as our operating results for 2017 and 2016 and forecasted operating results for the respective succeeding year.  Management also considered our overall market capitalization at December 31, 2017 and 2016.   Revenue recognition  — On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue guidance under Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not complete at December 31, 2017.  The adoption of the new accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and a cumulative adjustment was not recognized. Revenues for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while revenues prior to January 1, 2018 continue to be reported under previous revenue recognition requirements of Topic 605.  Use of estimates  — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from such estimates.    Key estimates used by management include:           •   allowance for doubtful accounts,           •   depreciation, depletion and amortization,           •   fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions,           •   goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and           •   reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.    For additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.    43      Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impac t on Operations and Financial Condition   Our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.  For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.  Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control.  Please see “Risk Factors – We are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.  Declines in Customers’ Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results” in Item 1A of this Report.  The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.  Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.  Oil prices have recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016.  Oil prices reached a high of $77.41 in June 2018.  Oil prices remain volatile, as the closing price of oil reached a fourth quarter 2018 high of $76.40 per barrel on October 3, 2018, before declining by 42% over the course of three months to reach a low of $44.48 per barrel in late December 2018.  Oil prices averaged $59.08 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018.  U.S. rig counts increased in response to improved oil prices in early 2018.  However, rig counts have fallen in response to lower oil prices, and we believe the rig count will not increase until oil prices increase.  We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.  Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers’ expectations of future oil and natural gas prices.  A decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or expectations of decreases in oil and natural gas prices, would likely result in reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.  Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.    Impact of Inflation   Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2018.  We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards   For a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.   Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   As of December 31, 2018, we would have had exposure to interest rate market risk associated with any borrowings that we had under the Credit Agreement and the Reimbursement Agreement.   Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate.  The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 1.00% to 2.00% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 0.00% to 1.00%, in each case determined based on our credit rating.  As of December 31, 2018, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 1.50% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 0.50%. As of December 31, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.  The interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility is variable and adjusts at each interest payment date based on our election of LIBOR or the base rate.  Under the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse Scotiabank on demand for any amounts that Scotiabank has disbursed under any letters of credit.  We are obligated to pay Scotiabank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum.  As of December 31, 2018, no amounts had been disbursed under any letters of credit.  We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars.  The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.  If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.  This currency risk is not material to our financial condition or results of operations.    The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.    44      Item 8.
