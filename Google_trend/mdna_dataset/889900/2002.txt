This Item 7 contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, without limitation, statements relating to:       - liquidity,       - financing of operations,       - continued volatility of oil and natural gas prices,       - source and sufficiency of funds required for capital needs and additional        rig acquisitions (if further opportunities arise),       - future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards,       - impact of inflation on our financial position and on our earnings per        share, and       - other such matters.       The words "believes," "budgeted," "expects," "project," "will," "could," "may," "plans," "intends," "strategy," or "anticipates," and similar expressions are used to identify our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update, revise or correct any of our forward-looking information. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading: "Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the 'Safe Harbor' Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995" beginning on page 13.       Off balance sheet arrangements.  We have no off balance sheet arrangements other than letters of credit of $20.0 million at December 31, 2001, maintained for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which would become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts. These letters of credit expire variously during each calendar year, but provide for an indefinite number of annual extensions of the expiration date. No amounts have been drawn under the letters of credit.       Trading and investing.  We do not engage in trading activities that include high-risk securities, such as derivatives and non-exchange traded contracts. We invest cash on hand only in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits, money markets and highly rated municipal and commercial bonds.       Description of business.  We are a leading provider of land-based contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas producers and operators in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Utah and Western Canada. We own the second largest land-based drilling fleet in North America with 319 drilling rigs. We provide drilling fluids, completion fluids and related services to oil and natural gas producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico, South Texas, East Texas, Oklahoma, the Gulf Coast regions of Texas and Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling and completion fluids are used by oil and natural gas operators during the drilling process to control pressure when drilling oil and natural gas wells. We also provide pressure pumping services in the Appalachian Basin. These services consist primarily of well stimulation and cementing for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells. To a lesser extent, we are engaged in the development, exploration, acquisition and production of oil and natural gas. Our oil and natural gas operations are not financially material and do not warrant disclosure as a business segment.       The contract drilling business experienced increased demand for drilling services from 1995 through most of 1997 due to higher oil and natural gas prices. The increase in demand returned, beginning in mid-1999 and continued through the second quarter of 2001. However, except for those periods and other occasional upturns, the market for onshore contract drilling services and the other services we provide has generally been depressed since 1982, when the number of operable land drilling rigs was at record levels. Since this time there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand in most operational and                                          19   geographic segments of the North American land drilling industry. As a result, drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins.       In addition to adverse effects that future declines in demand could have on Patterson-UTI, ongoing factors which could adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:       - movement of drilling rigs from region to region,       - reactivation of land-based drilling rigs, or       - new construction of drilling rigs.       We cannot predict either the future level of demand for our contract drilling services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling business.       Management estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Revenue recognition.  Generally, revenues are recognized when services are performed. We follow the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for footage contract drilling arrangements. Under this method, all drilling revenues, direct costs and appropriate portions of indirect costs, related to the contracts in progress, are recognized as contract drilling services are performed. Due to the nature of turnkey contract drilling arrangements and risks therein, we follow the completed contract method of accounting for such arrangements. Under this method, all drilling advances, direct costs and appropriate portions of indirect costs (including maintenance and repairs) related to the contracts in progress are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses in the period the contracts are completed. Provisions for losses on incomplete or in-process contracts are made when estimated total costs are expected to exceed total estimated revenues.       Related party transactions.  In 2001, 2000 and 1999, we leased a 1981 Beech King-Air 90 airplane owned by an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer and our President/Chief Operating Officer. Under the terms of the lease, we paid a monthly rental of $9,200 and our proportionate share of the costs of fuel, insurance, taxes and maintenance of the aircraft. We paid approximately $212,283, $193,769 and $222,583 for the lease of the airplane during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.       An affiliate acted as the first purchaser of oil produced from certain leases we operated during 1999. Sales of oil to that entity, both royalty and working interest were approximately $8.4 million. There were no sales of oil to that entity in 2001 or 2000.       The Company operates certain oil and natural gas properties in which our Chief Executive Officer, our President/Chief Operating Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and other affiliated persons or entities, purchased a joint interest ownership with us and other industry partners. We made oil and natural gas production payments (net of royalty) of $8.3 million, $13.4 million and $6.1 million from these properties in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, to the aforementioned persons or entities. These persons or entities reimbursed us for joint operating costs of $5.9 million, $8.0 million and $5.9 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.       In 2001, we paid approximately $387,000 to an entity owned by a relative of our President/Chief Operating Officer for certain equipment and metal fabrication services. One of our directors is a director and an officer of a company from which we purchased drill pipe, materials and supplies totalling approximately $22.0 million in 2001. This same director was an officer of a customer through February 2001 from which we received approximately $500,000 in revenues in 2001.                                          20   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       As of December 31, 2001, we had working capital of approximately $110.2 million including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $33.6 million. For 2001, our significant sources of cash flow were:       - $254.0 million derived from operations,       - $6.1 million from the exercise of stock options and warrants,       - $9.8 million of proceeds provided by a credit facility, and       - $742,000 from the sale of certain property and equipment.       Correspondingly, we used a portion of the funds discussed above as follows:       - $89.2 million to repay notes payable,       - $40.5 million as partial consideration in the acquisitions of Jones        Drilling Corporation and the assets of three related entities, the        drilling rigs and certain other assets of Cleere Drilling Company and six        additional drilling rigs from three separate transactions,       - $172.8 million to make capital expenditures for the betterment and        refurbishment of our drilling rigs, as well as the acquisition and        procurement of drilling equipment, including drill pipe, to fund        leasehold acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas        properties and to fund capital expenditures for our drilling and        completion fluids and pressure pumping segments and       - $1.1 million for the purchase of other long-term assets.       During 2001, we entered into five separate transactions, all accounted for as purchases, whereby we increased our land-based drilling rig fleet to 319, an increase of 44 rigs from a year ago. A brief description of each of the transactions follows:       - On December 21, 2001, we acquired 17 drilling rigs and related equipment        from Cleere Drilling Company for an aggregate purchase price of $25.8        million. The purchase price consisted of $13.5 million cash plus 450,000        shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire an additional 325,000        shares of common stock at an exercise price of $26.75 per share. The        common stock was recorded at $21.55 per share and the warrants were        valued at $8.00 per underlying share of our common stock using the        Black-Scholes option valuation model.       - On January 5, 2001, we acquired Jones Drilling Corporation and certain        assets of three entities related to Jones Drilling Corporation. The        acquired assets consisted of 21 drilling rigs (of which 14 were then        marketable) and related equipment and approximately $2.3 million of net        working capital. The purchase price of $33.0 million consisted of 810,070        shares of the Company's common stock valued at $26.8125 per share and        $11.3 million cash plus approximately $240,000 in transaction costs.       - In January 2001, we acquired six drilling rigs, through three separate        transactions, for approximately $15.7 million cash.       On February 4, 2001, Patterson entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with UTI providing for the merger of the two entities. On May 8, 2001, the stockholders of each company approved the merger, and the merger was consummated. Each outstanding share of UTI common stock was converted into one share of Patterson common stock and each option or warrant then outstanding representing the right to receive UTI common stock was converted into the right to purchase Patterson-UTI common stock on an equivalent basis. A total of 37,782,135 shares of Patterson common stock was issued pursuant to the merger and an additional 3,621,079 shares were reserved for issuance under the UTI stock option plans. Additionally, our stockholders approved an increase in the authorized shares of our common stock from 50 million to 200 million and a name change to "Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc."       During 2001, we repaid $89.2 million under our existing credit facilities and other term obligations. We incurred expenses of $448,000 as a result of prepayment penalties and $942,000 related to deferred financing                                          21   costs which were unamortized at the time the debt was extinguished. The penalties and deferred financing costs were included in restructuring and related charges during 2001.       In June 2001, we increased our existing revolving line of credit to $100.0 million and extended the term of the facility to June 2005. The revolving line of credit carries a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.75% based on twelve-month trailing EBITDA. The facility has no financial covenants unless availability under the facility is less than $20.0 million. The terms of our credit facility limit the payment of dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders.       We believe that the current level of cash and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our immediate capital needs. From time to time, acquisition opportunities are reviewed relating to our business. The timing, size or success of any acquisition and the associated capital commitments are unpredictable. Should further opportunities for growth requiring capital arise, we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash generated from operations, and either debt or equity financing. However, there can be no assurance that such capital would be available.

However, beginning in the third quarter of 2001 the industry conditions began to deteriorate as the commodity prices of oil and natural gas significantly weakened. Market prices for oil fell from approximately $27 per barrel at the end of 2000 to approximately $17 per barrel in late 2001 and natural gas prices declined from approximately $10 per Mcf to under $3 per Mcf for the same time period. Accordingly, the demand for our contract drilling services has been negatively impacted. Should commodity prices improve, we would expect to begin to see increases in demand.

Deteriorating industry conditions as noted above also had an adverse impact on our drilling and completion fluids division beginning in the third quarter of 2001. Should industry conditions improve, we would expect to begin to see improvements in such operations.

(23,833)     (2,894)   (723.5)%        The merger costs and restructuring charges incurred in 2001 are associated with our merger with UTI that occurred in 2001. Weakened commodity prices resulted in depletion expense increasing from $3.4 million                                          23   in 2000 to $7.2 million in 2001. Included in depletion expense in 2001 is approximately $1.1 million of impairment expense to our oil and natural gas properties and other valuation allowances associated with impairment to our undeveloped properties. This impairment is attributable to declining commodity prices and unfavorable results from certain oil and natural gas prospects. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of the increased activity as evidenced by the operating segments' individual results of operations and the growth of our Company in 2001 through acquisitions. Included in this increase are management and operational bonuses resulting from improved operations.

(2,894)    (1,398)   (107.0)%        The increase in revenues in Other and Corporate is reflective of increased activity in our oil and natural gas operations resulting from a rise in the average price received for crude oil from $17.88 per BBL to $30.09 per BBL and a rise in the average price received for natural gas from $2.31 per Mcf to $4.32 per Mcf from 1999 to 2000, respectively.

We recognized income tax expense of $22.9 million for 2000, even though a minimal current expense existed due to loss carryforwards from prior years.       Our remaining unutilized investment tax credit carryforward expired in 2000. Net operating losses were fully utilized in 2001 and the remaining alternative minimum tax credit may be carried forward indefinitely. Deferred tax assets at December 31, 2001, consist primarily of various allowance accounts and tax deferred expenses expected to generate a future tax benefit of approximately $8.1 million.       We record non-cash federal deferred income taxes based primarily on the relationship between the amount of our unused federal NOL carryforwards and the temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis in our assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we will incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized. We incurred deferred income tax expense of approximately $14.6 million and $15.9 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively, and a deferred income tax benefit of approximately $4.9 million for 1999.                                          25   VOLATILITY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES       Our revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas, with respect to all of our operating segments. Historically, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile. Prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as actions of state and local agencies, the United States and foreign governments and international cartels. All of these are beyond our control. Any significant or extended decline in oil and/or natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.       Due to a decline in oil and natural gas prices beginning in the second quarter of 2001, demand for drilling rigs declined beginning in the third quarter of 2001 and is continuing. This decline in demand has resulted in a steep decline in drilling rig utilization and day rates, which in turn has adversely impacted our operations.  IMPACT OF INFLATION       We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.  RECENTLY-ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS       The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations," ("SFAS No. 141") in June 2001. SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes APB Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations," and FASB Statement No. 38, "Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises." SFAS No. 141 is effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and mandates that such combinations are to be accounted for using the purchase method. The Company adopted SFAS No. 141 as of June 30, 2001.       The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," ("SFAS No. 142") in June 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142 applies to all fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The provisions of SFAS No. 142, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2002, are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Approximately $4.6 million in amortization expenses recognized during 2001 would not have been recognized under SFAS No. 142.       The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," ("SFAS No. 143") in July 2001. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. SFAS No. 143 is effective beginning June 15, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 143 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.       The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," ("SFAS No. 144") in August 2001. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121 and APB Opinion No. 30. SFAS No. 144 is effective beginning January 1, 2002, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       We currently have no exposure to interest rate market risk as we have no outstanding balance under our credit facility. Should we incur a balance in the future, we would have some exposure associated with the floating rate of the interest charged on that balance. The credit facility, which expires on June 29, 2005, bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.75% based on the Company's twelve-month trailing EBITDA. Our exposure to interest rate risk due to changes in LIBOR is not expected to be material.       We conduct some business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations. The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years. If the value of                                          26   the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to U.S. dollars. Also, the value of our Canadian net assets in U.S. dollars may decline.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
