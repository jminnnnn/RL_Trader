Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      Recent Developments  —  Oil prices have significantly declined since the second half of 2014.  The closing price of oil, which was as high as $105.68 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, reached a low price for 2015 of $34.55 in December 2015 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.68 in January 2016.  As a result of the prolonged decline in oil prices, our industry continues to experience a   21   severe decline in both contract drilling and pressure pumping activity levels.  We do not expect this to change until commodity prices improve.  Low commodity prices are negatively impacting spending by exploration and production companies.  The impact of these spending reductions is evidenced by published rig counts, which in the United States decreased more than 60% during 2015 and is now almost 70% lower than the peak in 2014.    Our rig count has also significantly declined.  As of December 31, 2015, we had 80 drilling rigs operating in the United States, which was a decrease of 63% from the recent peak of 214 rigs in October 2014.  Our operating rig count has continued to decline in 2016.  On average, we operated 78 rigs in the United States during January 2016.  Term contracts provided some support of our operating rig count during 2015.  Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 59 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter and an average of 46 rigs operating under term contracts during 2016.  Our pressure pumping business is continuing to experience the effects of reduced spending by customers and downward pressure on pricing.  Due to market conditions, as of December 31, 2015, we had stacked approximately 38% of our fracturing horsepower.  With the weakness in commodity prices since the beginning of 2016, we have seen a significant decrease in the amount of available work, and the profitability of available work has continued to deteriorate.  In response, since the beginning of 2016, we have stacked approximately 140,000 fracturing horsepower.  In total, we now have stacked slightly more than half of our fleet of more than 1 million hydraulic fracturing horsepower.    In anticipation of this downturn, we began reducing our cost structure in the fourth quarter of 2014.  In 2015, we continued to reduce our cost structure and, to date, we have reduced our drilling headcount at a rate generally proportionate with the reduction in our rig count.  In 2015, we significantly reduced our pressure pumping headcount and obtained lower prices on many products and services that we use.  We also reduced our capital expenditures in 2015, and we expect our capital expenditures for 2016 to primarily consist of maintenance capital, inspections and potential upgrades, as we do not expect to build any new rigs or purchase any new fracturing horsepower in 2016.  We plan to continue to adjust our cost structure in line with our level of operating activity.    We expect that our term contract coverage in contract drilling and scalability with respect to labor and other operating costs in contract drilling and pressure pumping should position us to weather this downturn.  In the event oil prices remain depressed for a sustained period, or decline further, we may experience further significant declines in both drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing and in pressure pumping activity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Management Overview  — We are a leading provider of services to the North American oil and natural gas industry.  Our services primarily involve the drilling, on a contract basis, of land-based oil and natural gas wells and pressure pumping services.  In addition to these services, we also invest, on a non-operating working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.    We operate land-based drilling rigs in oil and natural gas producing regions of the continental United States and western Canada, and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America.  There continues to be uncertainty with respect to the global economic environment, and oil and natural gas prices are significantly depressed.  During the fourth quarter of 2015, our average number of rigs operating in the United States was 88 compared to an average of 210 drilling rigs operating during the same period in 2014.  During the fourth quarter of 2015, our average number of rigs operating in Canada was three compared to an average of nine drilling rigs operating during the fourth quarter of 2014.   We have addressed our customers’ needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years.  As of December 31, 2015, our rig fleet included 161 APEX ®  rigs.  We do not expect to add any new rigs to our fleet during 2016.   In connection with the development of horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs.  As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1.1 million hydraulic horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet.  We have increased the horsepower of our pressure pumping fleet by more than eight-fold since the beginning of 2009, although we have not ordered or committed to purchase any new horsepower since October 2014 and there is currently no new horsepower on order.  In recent years, the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace and lower oil and natural gas prices have led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.  We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more.  Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $710 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. The decrease in backlog at December 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, is primarily due to the revenue earned since December 31, 2014, including from the receipt of early termination payments, and the expiration and termination of term contracts. Approximately 40 percent of the total December 31, 2015 backlog is reasonably expected to remain after 2016.  We generally   22   calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the  contract.  The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the ri g is moving   or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract.  In addition, generally our term drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termina tion payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.  For contracts  that  we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate , for the period we expect to receive the lower rate.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors –  Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized ,  as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated  Without an Early Termination Payment .”    For the three years ended December 31, 2015, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):                  2015           2014           2013         Contract drilling       $   1,153,892               61   %       $   1,838,830               58   %       $   1,679,611               62   %     Pressure pumping           712,454               38   %           1,293,265               41   %           979,166               36   %     Oil and natural gas           24,931               1   %           50,196               1   %           57,257               2   %             $   1,891,277               100   %       $   3,182,291               100   %       $   2,716,034               100   %       Generally, the profitability of our business is impacted most by two primary factors in our contract drilling segment: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.  During 2015, our average number of rigs operating was 120 in the United States and four in Canada compared to 203 in the United States and eight in Canada in 2014 and 184 in the United States and eight in Canada in 2013.  Our average rig revenue per operating day was $25,560 in 2015 compared to $23,880 in 2014 and $24,020 in 2013.  We had a consolidated net loss of $294 million for 2015 compared to consolidated net income of $163 million for 2014.  The financial results for 2015 include pretax non-cash charges totaling approximately $288 million.  These charges include $125 million from the impairment of all goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business, $131 million from the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components, $22.0 from the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and closed facilities and $10.7 million related to the impairment of certain oil and natural gas properties.   The financial results for 2014 include a pretax non-cash charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components.   Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.  During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services.  Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.  Oil and natural gas prices and our monthly average number of rigs operating have significantly declined from recent highs.  In December 2015, our average number of rigs operating was 82 in the United States.  In January 2016, our average number of rigs operating decreased to 78 in the United States.    We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues, weather and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  Please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report.    Critical Accounting Policies   In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.  The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.    Property and equipment  — Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.  We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.  Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.  No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.  We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (“triggering events”) indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives.  In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.  The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time.  Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate.  Based on management’s expectations of future trends, we estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment.  These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management’s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.    23   Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset’s net book value.  Any provision for impairment is measured at fai r value.    On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional, vertical wells versus drilling longer, horizontal wells using higher specification rigs).  The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.  The remaining components of these rigs will be retired.  In 2015, we identified 24 mechanical rigs and 9 non-APEX® electric rigs that would no longer be marketed.  Also, we had 15 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.  Although these 15 rigs remain marketable, we have lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to higher specification drilling rigs.  In 2015, we recorded a charge of $131 million related to the retirement of the 33 rigs, the 15 mechanical rigs that remain marketable but were not operating, and the write-down of excess spare rig components to their realizable values.  In 2014, we identified 55 mechanical rigs that we determined would no longer be marketed, and we recorded a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the reduced size of our mechanical fleet.  In 2013, we identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.  Also, we had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.  Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.  In 2013, we recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.  We also periodically evaluate our pressure pumping assets, and in 2015, we recorded a charge of $22.0 million for the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and certain closed facilities.  There were no similar charges in 2014 or 2013.  We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable (a “triggering event”).  During the first quarter of 2015, oil prices averaged $48.54 per barrel and reached a low of $43.39 per barrel in March 2015.  Oil prices improved during the second quarter of 2015 and averaged $57.85 per barrel.  Although the price improvement was earlier than we projected, this improvement was generally consistent with our assumption at December 31, 2014 that oil prices would improve late in 2015 and continue to improve in 2016, resulting in improved activity levels for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.  During the second quarter of 2015 as oil prices increased, we received requests from customers to reactivate drilling rigs to resume operations in the third quarter of 2015.  We believed this was an indication that future activity levels would be improving for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.  During the third quarter of 2015, however, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel and reached a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015.    With lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.   In light of these revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping services during the third quarter of 2015, we deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived asset groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping.  We performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.  With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated.  Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 60%, respectively.    Due to the continued deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we deemed it necessary to again assess the recoverability of long-lived assets groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping.  We performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.  With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated.  Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 100%, respectively.    For both of the assessments performed in 2015, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling segment included the backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which was approximately $801 million and $710 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.   Rigs not under term contracts will be subject to pricing in the spot market.  Utilization and rates for rigs in the spot market and for the pressure pumping segment were estimated based upon our historical experience in prior downturns.  Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments were based on the assumption that activity levels in both segments would begin to recover in the first quarter of 2017 in response to improved oil prices.   While we believe these assumptions with respect to future pricing for oil and natural gas are reasonable, actual future prices may vary significantly from the ones that were assumed.  The timeframe over which oil and natural gas prices will recover is highly uncertain.  Potential events that could affect our assumptions regarding future prices and the timeframe for a recovery are affected by factors such as:                  ·   market supply and demand,   24                   ·   the desire and ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly known as OPEC, to set and maintain production and price targets,         ·   the level of production by OPEC and non-OPEC countries,         ·   domestic and international military, political, economic and weather conditions,         ·   legal and other limitations or restrictions on exportation and/or importation of oil and natural gas,                       ·   technical advances affecting energy consumption and production,         ·   the price and availability of alternative fuels,         ·   the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas, and         ·   regulations regarding the exploration, development, production and delivery of oil and natural gas.    All of these factors are beyond our control. If the current lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment were to last into 2017 and beyond, our actual cash flows would likely be less than the expected cash flows used in these assessments and could result in impairment charges in the future and such impairment could be material.    Goodwill  — Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.   Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as of December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.  For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.  Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be our operating segments.  We first determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if it is, then goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step quantitative impairment test.  From time to time, we may perform the first step of the quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing the qualitative assessment.  The first step of the quantitative testing is to compare the fair value of an entity’s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the quantitative testing is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.  If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the shortfall.     During the first quarter of 2015, oil prices averaged $48.54 per barrel and reached a low of $43.39 per barrel in March 2015.  Oil prices improved during the second quarter of 2015 and averaged $57.85 per barrel.  Although the price improvement was earlier than we projected, this improvement was generally consistent with our assumption at December 31, 2014, that oil prices would improve in late 2015 and continue to improve in 2016, resulting in improved activity levels for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.  During the second quarter of 2015 as oil prices increased, we received requests from customers to reactivate drilling rigs to resume operations in the third quarter of 2015.  We believed this was an indication that future activity levels would be improving for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.  During the third quarter of 2015, however, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel and reached a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 24, 2015.  With lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.  In light of our revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping services during the third quarter of 2015, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill as of September 30, 2015.  In completing the first step of the assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods. The estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.  The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling and pressure pumping reporting units, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.   Based on the results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit; however, impairment was indicated in our pressure pumping reporting unit.  In the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $125 million associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill of the pressure pumping reporting unit.     We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of the goodwill of our contract drilling reporting unit as of December 31, 2015.  In completing the first step of the assessment, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods.  The estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.  The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling reporting unit, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.  Based on the results of the first step of the quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill, as of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit.  25   In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31,  2014, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.  In making this determination, we  considered the continued demand experienced during 2014 for our services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.  We also considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall  level of business activity in these operating segments.  Additionally, operating results for 2014 and forecasted operating results for 2015 were also taken into account.  Our overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the f air values of our reporting units over their carrying values from our 2013 quantitative Step 1 assessment of goodwill were also considered.    We have undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade our fleet of equipment and believe that we are well positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells.  In the event that market conditions were to remain weak for a protracted period, we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in our contract drilling reporting unit in the future, and such impairment could be material.    Revenue recognition  — Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.  Expenditures reimbursed by customers are recognized as revenue and the related expenses are recognized as direct costs.  All of the wells we drilled in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were drilled under daywork contracts.    Use of estimates  — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from such estimates.    Key estimates used by management include:           ·   allowance for doubtful accounts,           ·   depreciation, depletion and amortization,           ·   fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions,           ·   goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and           ·   reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.    Oil and natural gas properties  — Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.  Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.  Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.  Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.  We review wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.  If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, we consider the well costs to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense.  Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties, are charged to expense when incurred.  The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved developed oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.  Oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.    We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.  Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on our expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.  These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.  If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and fair value.  The fair value estimates used in measuring impairment are based on internally developed unobservable inputs including reserve volumes and future production, pricing and operating costs (Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting).  The expected future net cash flows are discounted using an annual rate of 10% to determine fair value.  We review unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.  Our impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as our intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.  If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.  Impairment expense related to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties totaled   26   approximately $ 10.7  million, $ 20.9  million and $ 4.0  million for the years ended Dece mber 31, 201 5 , 201 4  and 201 3 , respectively, and is included in depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.    For additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.    Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our liquidity as of December 31, 2015 included approximately $178 million in working capital and $500 million available under our revolving credit facility.      We believe our current liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to maintain and make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends.  If under current market conditions we desire to pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would likely require additional debt or equity financing.  However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.   As of December 31, 2015, we had working capital of $178 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $113 million, compared to working capital of $341 million and cash and cash equivalents of $43 million at December 31, 2014.    During 2015, our sources of cash flow included:           ·   $999 million from operating activities,           ·   $200 million in borrowings pursuant to a new term loan agreement, and          ·   $20.8 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.    During 2015, we used a net of $303 million to pay off our revolving credit facility, $58.8 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $27.5 million to repay long-term debt, $8.0 million to acquire shares of our common stock, $2.0 million to pay debt issuance costs and $744 million:           ·   to build and to acquire components to build new drilling rigs and to purchase new pressure pumping equipment,           ·   to make capital expenditures for the betterment and refurbishment of existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment,           ·   to acquire and procure equipment and facilities for our drilling and pressure pumping operations, and           ·   to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis.    We paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2015 as follows:                  Per Share

        On February 3, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.10 per share to be paid on March 24, 2016 to holders of record as of March 10, 2016.  Our 2015 Term Loan Agreement contains a covenant that could restrict our ability to make dividend payments later in 2016.  This covenant applies to only the 2015 Term Loan Agreement indebtedness, and we believe that our strong financial position allows us various alternatives to address this restriction, including repayment of this debt.  However, the amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our debt agreements and other factors.    On July 25, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program authorizing purchases of up to $150 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.  On September 6, 2013, our Board of Directors terminated any remaining authority under the 2012 stock buyback program, and approved a new stock buyback program that authorizes purchase of up to $200 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.  As of December 31, 2015, we had   27   remaining authorization to purchase approximately $187 million of our outstanding common stock under the  2013  stock buyback program.  Shares purchased under a buyback program are accounted for as treasury stock.    We acquired shares of stock from employees during 2015, 2014 and 2013 that are accounted for as treasury stock.  Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees.  The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll tax withholding obligations upon the exercise of stock options, the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock.  These shares were acquired at fair market value.  These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”) or the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and not pursuant to the stock buyback programs.    Treasury stock acquisitions during the year ended

Agreement —   On September 27, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”).  The Credit Agreement is a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility.  The Credit Agreement replaced a previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility.    The revolving credit facility permits aggregate borrowings of up to $500 million outstanding at any time.  The revolving credit facility contains a letter of credit facility that is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that is limited to $40 million, in each case outstanding at any time.    The term loan facility provides for a loan of $100 million, which was drawn on December 24, 2012.  The term loan facility is payable in quarterly principal installments which commenced December 27, 2012.  The installment amounts vary from 1.25% of the original principal amount for each of the first four quarterly installments, 2.50% of the original principal amount for each of the subsequent eight quarterly installments, 5.00% of the original principal amount for the subsequent four quarterly installments and 13.75% of the original principal amount for the final four quarterly installments.    Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders’ aggregate commitments with respect to the revolving credit facility and/or the term loan facility be increased by up to $100 million, not to exceed total commitments of $700 million.  The maturity date under the Credit Agreement is September 27, 2017 for both the revolving facility and the term facility.    Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate.  The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 2.25% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 1.25% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio.  As of December 31, 2015, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 2.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.  Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at September 30, 2015, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans is 2.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans is 1.25% as of January 1, 2016.  Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2015, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2016.  A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit.  The commitment fee rate payable to the lenders for the unused portion of the credit facility is 0.50%.    Each of our domestic subsidiaries will unconditionally guarantee all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the other guarantors and us arising under the Credit Agreement, other than (a) Ambar Lone Star Fluid Services LLC, (b) domestic subsidiaries that directly or indirectly have no material assets other than equity interests in, or capitalization indebtedness owed by, foreign subsidiaries, and (c) any subsidiary having total assets of less than $1 million.  Such guarantees also cover our obligations and those of any of our subsidiaries arising under any interest rate swap contract with any person while such person is a lender or an affiliate of a lender under the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement requires compliance with two financial covenants.  We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 45%.  The Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last   28   day of t he most recently ended fiscal quarter.  We also must not permit the interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00.  The Credit Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of earnings be fore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period.  We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 201 5 .  The Credit Agreement also contains customary repres entations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants.  We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.    Events of default under the Credit Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, as well as a cross default event, loan document enforceability event, change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.  If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then a majority of the lenders have the right, among others, to (i) terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement, (ii) accelerate and require us to repay all the outstanding amounts owed under any loan document (provided that in limited circumstances with respect to insolvency and bankruptcy such acceleration is automatic), and (iii) require us to cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit.    As of December 31, 2015, we had $70.0 million principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility at an interest rate of 2.875% and no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.  We currently have available borrowing capacity of $500 million under the revolving credit facility.    2015 Reimbursement Agreement  — On March 16, 2015, we entered into a Reimbursement Agreement (the “Reimbursement Agreement”) with The Bank of Nova Scotia (“Scotiabank”), pursuant to which we may from time to time request that Scotiabank issue an unspecified amount of letters of credit.  As of December 31, 2015, we had $41.1 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Reimbursement Agreement.  Under the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse Scotiabank on demand for any amounts that Scotiabank has disbursed under any letters of credit.  Fees, charges and other reasonable expenses for the issuance of letters of credit are payable by us at the time of issuance at such rates and amounts as are in accordance with Scotiabank’s prevailing practice.  We are obligated to pay to Scotiabank interest on all amounts not paid on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum, calculated daily and payable monthly, in arrears, on the basis of a calendar year for the actual number of days elapsed, with interest on overdue interest at the same rate as on the reimbursement amounts.  We have also agreed that if obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on any of our subsidiaries’ property, then our reimbursement obligations and (to the extent similar obligations would be secured under the Credit Agreement) other obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement and any letters of credit will be equally and ratably secured by all property subject to such liens securing the Credit Agreement.  Pursuant to a Continuing Guaranty dated as of March 16, 2015 (the “Continuing Guaranty”), our payment obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed as to payment and not as to collection by our subsidiaries that from time to time guarantee payment under the Credit Agreement.  2015 Term Loan Agreement  — On March 18, 2015, we entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the “2015 Term Loan Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and lender, each of the other lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner, and Bank of America, N.A. and The Bank Of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD., as Co-Syndication Agents.  The 2015 Term Loan Agreement is a senior unsecured single-advance term loan facility pursuant to which we made a term loan borrowing of $200 million on March 18, 2015 (the “Term Loan Borrowing”).  The Term Loan Borrowing is payable in quarterly principal installments, together with accrued interest, on each June 30, September 30, December 31 and March 31, commencing on June 30, 2015.  Each of the first four principal installments is in an amount equal to 2.5% of the Term Loan Borrowing and each successive quarterly installment, until and including June 30, 2017, is in an amount equal to 5.0% of the Term Loan Borrowing, with the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan Borrowing due on the maturity date under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement.  The maturity date under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement is September 27, 2017.  Loans under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement bear interest, at our election, at the per annum rate of LIBOR rate plus 3.25% or base rate plus 2.25%.  Each of our domestic subsidiaries will unconditionally guarantee all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the other guarantors and us arising under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement and other Loan Documents (as defined in the 2015 Term Loan Agreement), other than (a) Ambar Lone Star Fluid Services LLC, (b) domestic subsidiaries that directly or indirectly have no material assets other than equity interests in, or capitalization indebtedness owed by, foreign subsidiaries, and (c) any subsidiary having total assets of less than $1 million.  29   The 2015 Term Loan Agreement requires quarterly compliance with two financial covenants.  We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 45%.  The 2015 Term Loan Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization rat io as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.  We also must not permit the interest coverage ra tio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00.  The 2015 Term Loan Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA of the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period.  We were  in compliance with these financial covenants as of  December 31 , 2015.  The 2015 Term Loan Agreement further provides that neither we nor our subsidiaries are permitted to make restricted payments unless, after giving effect to such restricted payment, our pro forma ratio of debt to EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters, determined as of the preceding ending quarterly period, does not exceed 2.50 to 1.00.  Restricted payments are generally defined as (a) dividends and distributions made on account of our equity interests or our subsidiaries and (b) payments made to redeem, repurchase or otherwise retire our equity interests or our subsidiaries.  Payments made solely in the form of common equity interests, made to us and our subsidiaries, or made in connection with our long-term incentive plans are not restricted payments under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement.   We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.    The 2015 Term Loan Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default.  Events of default under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, as well as a cross default event, Loan Document enforceability event, change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.  If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then a majority of the lenders have the right, among others, to accelerate and require us to repay all the outstanding amounts owed under any Loan Document (provided that in limited circumstances with respect to insolvency and bankruptcy, such acceleration is automatic).  As of December 31, 2015, we had $185 million principal amount outstanding under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement at an interest rate of 3.875%.  Senior Notes —   On October 5, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 5, 2020 (the “Series A Notes”) in a private placement.  The Series A Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.97% per annum.  We pay interest on the Series A Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year.  The Series A Notes will mature on October 5, 2020.    On June 14, 2012, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amounts of our 4.27% Series B Senior Notes due June 14, 2022 (the “Series B Notes”) in a private placement.  The Series B Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.27% per annum.  We pay interest on the Series B Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year.  The Series B Notes will mature on June 14, 2022.    The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsubordinated indebtedness.  The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our domestic subsidiaries other than subsidiaries that are not required to be guarantors under the Credit Agreement.   The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are prepayable at our option, in whole or in part, provided that in the case of a partial prepayment, prepayment must be in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, at any time and from time to time at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date, plus a “make-whole” premium as specified in the note purchase agreements.  We must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of any change of control.  In addition, we must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions if the proceeds therefrom are not timely reinvested in productive assets.  If any offer to prepay is accepted, the purchase price of each prepaid note is 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the prepayment date.    The respective note purchase agreements require compliance with two financial covenants.  We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 50% at any time.  The note purchase agreements generally define the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.  We also must not permit the interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.00.  The note purchase agreements generally define the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period.  We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2015.  We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.    Events of default under the note purchase agreements include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, a cross default event, a judgment in excess of a threshold event, the guaranty agreement   30   ceasing to  be enforceable, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, a change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.  If an event of default under the note purchase agreements occurs and is continuing, then holders of a majority in principal amoun t of the respective notes have the right to declare all the notes then-outstanding to be immediately due and payable.  In addition, if  we  default in payments on any note, then until such defaults are cured, the holder thereof may declare all the notes held  by it pursuant to the note purchase agreement to be immediately due and payable.    Commitments and Contingencies  — As of December 31, 2015, we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $41.1 million for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which could become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts.  These letters of credit expire annually at various times during the year and are typically renewed.  As of December 31, 2015, no amounts had been drawn under the letters of credit.    As of December 31, 2015, we had commitments to purchase approximately $73.5 million of major equipment for our drilling and pressure pumping businesses.    Our pressure pumping business has entered into agreements to purchase minimum quantities of proppants and chemicals from certain vendors.  These agreements expire in 2016, 2017 and 2018.  As of December 31, 2015, the remaining obligation under these agreements was approximately $26.6 million, of which materials with a total purchase price of approximately $9.5 million were required to be purchased during 2016.  In the event that the required minimum quantities are not purchased during any contract year, we could be required to make a liquidated damages payment to the respective vendor for any shortfall.    In November 2011, our pressure pumping business entered into an agreement with a proppant vendor to advance up to $12.0 million to such vendor to finance its construction of certain processing facilities.  This advance is secured by the underlying processing facilities and bears interest at an annual rate of 5.0%.  Repayment of the advance is to be made through discounts applied to purchases from the vendor and repayment of all amounts advanced must be made no later than October 1, 2017.  As of December 31, 2015, advances of approximately $11.8 million had been made under this agreement and repayments of approximately $10.6 million had been received resulting in a balance outstanding of approximately $1.2 million.    A $12.3 million charge related to the previously disclosed settlement of a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against our U.S. contract drilling subsidiary was recorded in the first quarter of 2015.

the reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years have resulted in an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand.  Also in recent years, customer demand has shifted away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, reducing the utilization rates of our mechanically powered drilling rigs.  The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2015 and 2014 follows:                  1 st           2 nd           3 rd           4 th

gas price represents  the average monthly Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.    The decreases in revenues and direct operating costs primarily result from the decrease in the number of rigs operating.  Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2015 primarily due to higher average dayrates and early termination revenues of approximately $69.4 million.  Selling, general and administrative expense for 2015 includes a $12.3 million charge related to a previously disclosed legal settlement.  Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 includes a charge of $131 million related to the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components.  Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2014 includes a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of mechanical drilling rigs and the write-off of excess spare mechanical rig components.  The increase in depreciation expense also reflects significant capital expenditures incurred in recent years to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade existing drilling rigs and to acquire additional related equipment such as top drives, drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.                  Year Ended December 31,         Pressure Pumping       2015           2014           % Change                 (Dollars in thousands)         Revenues       $   712,454

2013 as a result of an increase in the number of rigs operating.  Revenues in 2013 included approximately $65.2 million of early termination revenues.  Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2013 due to the early termination revenue.  Capital expenditures were incurred in 2014 and 2013 to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade existing drilling rigs and to acquire additional equipment including top drives, drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.  In 2014, we identified 55 mechanical rigs that we determined would no longer be marketed.  We recorded additional depreciation, amortization and impairment expense of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the now reduced size of our mechanical fleet.  In 2013, we identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.  Also, we had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.  Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.  We recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.  Significant capital expenditures incurred in recent years to add new rig capacity also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense.                     Year Ended December 31,

our jobs and the size of our pressure pumping fleet.  Our customers continued the development of unconventional reservoirs resulting in an increase in larger multi-stage   35   fracturing jobs associated therewith.  In connection with the horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs, includ ing the June 2014 acquisition of an East Texas-based pressure pumping operation and the October 2014 acquisition of a Texas-based pressure pumping operation.  As a result, we continued to experience an increase in the number of these larger multi-stage fra cturing jobs as a proportion of the total fracturing jobs we performed.  Additionally, the average size of the multi-stage fracturing jobs increased.  Average revenue per fracturing job and average direct operating costs per total job increased as a result  of this increase in the proportion of larger multi-stage fracturing jobs and the increased size of the jobs in 2014 as compared to 2013.  Depreciation expense increased due to capital expenditures.                   Year Ended December 31,         Oil and Natural Gas Production and Exploration

defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depletion and impairment.    Oil revenues decreased as a result of lower average oil prices and lower production.  Natural gas and liquids revenue increased due to higher average prices, partially offset by lower production.  Direct operating costs and depletion expense increased primarily due to the addition of new wells.  Depletion and impairment expense in 2014 includes approximately $20.9 million of oil and natural gas property impairments, compared to approximately $4.0 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2013.  The impairment in 2014 is primarily the result of lower oil prices.                   Year Ended December 31,         Corporate and Other       2014           2013           % Change

corporate activities because such transactions relate to corporate strategy decisions of our executive management group.  The net gain on the disposal of assets in 2014 resulted primarily from miscellaneous sales of drilling equipment and sales of certain oil and natural gas properties.    36   Adjusted EBITDA   Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is not defined by U.S. GAAP.  We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense.  We present Adjusted EBITDA (a non-U.S. GAAP measure) because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to both the performance of our fundamental business activities and our ability to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measures of net income (loss) or operating cash flow.                   Year Ended December 31,                 2015           2014           2013                 (Dollars in thousands)         Net

Deduction (IRC section 199 deduction) was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and allows a deduction of 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.  The permanent differences for 2013 include a deduction of $10.0 million as we fully utilized our remaining net operating loss carryforwards.  The permanent differences for 2014 include a deduction of $8.8 million.  The permanent differences for 2015 do not include any deduction as it is limited to taxable income, and we did not have taxable income in 2015 as a result of our election to utilize bonus depreciation.  The 2015 other differences include a 1.0% reduction related to the reconciliation of the deferred tax liability associated with the conversion of our Canadian operations to a controlled foreign corporation.  The impact to the deferred tax liability from the conversion is being amortized over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.  The 2015 other differences also include a 0.7% reduction for the lost benefit of the 2014 IRC section 199 deduction of $8.8 million as a result of our adoption of the final tangible property regulations with the filing of the 2014 tax return.  We record deferred federal income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled.  As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized.  We recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately $100 million in 2015 and deferred tax expense of approximately $44 million in 2014 and $51 million in 2013.    On January 1, 2010, we converted our Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for federal income tax purposes.  This transaction triggered a $1 million increase in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as an   37   increase  to deferred i ncome tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.   This will be fully amortized by December 31, 2016.  As a result of the above conversion, our Canadian assets are no longer directly subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.  Effective January 1, 2010, we have elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intend to do so for the foreseeable future.  As a result, no deferred United States federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $28.4 million as of December 31, 2015.  The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings was approximately $3.8 million, net of available foreign tax credits.  This liability would be recognized if we received a dividend of the unremitted earnings.    Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impact on Operations and Financial Condition   Our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.  For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.  Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control.  Please see “Risk Factors – We are Dependent on the Oil and Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.  Declines in Customers’ Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results” in Item 1A of this Report.  Oil prices have significantly declined since the second half of 2014.  The closing price of oil, which was as high as $105.68 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, reached a low price for 2015 of $34.55 in December 2015 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.68 in January 2016.  As a result of the prolonged decline in oil prices, our industry continues to experience a severe decline in both contract drilling and pressure pumping activity levels.  We do not expect this to change until commodity prices improve.  We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.  Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers’ expectations of future oil and natural gas prices.  A continued decline in demand for oil and natural gas or prolonged low oil or natural gas prices would likely result in further reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.      Impact of Inflation   Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2015.  We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the recognition of revenue from customers.  Under this guidance, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.  This guidance also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty, if any, of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.    In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period.  The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition.  The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance for the presentation of debt issuance costs.  Under this guidance, debt issuance costs shall be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt and shall not be classified as a deferred charge. Amortization of debt issuance costs shall continue to be reported as interest expense.  The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance for the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets.  Under this guidance, for a particular tax-paying component of an entity and within a particular tax jurisdiction, all deferred tax liabilities and assets, as well as any related valuation allowance, shall be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount. The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  38         Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We currently have exposure to interest rate market risk associated with any borrowings that we have under the Credit Agreement, the 2015 Term Loan Agreement and the Reimbursement Agreement.   Under the Credit Agreement, interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.  The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.25% to 3.25% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.25%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.  At December 31, 2015, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.25% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.  Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at September 30, 2015, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans is 2.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans is 1.25% as of January 1, 2016.  Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2015, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2016.  As of December 31, 2015, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $70.0 million outstanding under our term loan facility at an interest rate of 2.875%.  The interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement is variable and adjusts at each interest payment date based on our election of LIBOR or the base rate.  A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our term credit facility as of December 31, 2015 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $632,000.   Loans under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement bear interest, at our election, at the per annum rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% or base rate plus 2.25%.  As of December 31, 2015, we had $185 million principal amount outstanding under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement at an interest rate of 3.875%.  A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under 2015 Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2015 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $1.8 million.  Under the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse the issuing bank on demand for any amounts that it has disbursed under any letters of credit.  We are obligated to pay to the issuing bank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum.  As of December 31, 2015, no amounts had been disbursed under any letters of credit.  We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations.  The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.  If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.  This currency risk is not material to our results of operations or financial condition.    The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.          Item 8.
