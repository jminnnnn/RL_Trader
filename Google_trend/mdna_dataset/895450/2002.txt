ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.   GENERAL     We derive our revenue from providing construction, engineering and specialty services to the oil, gas and power industries and government entities worldwide. We obtain contracts for our work primarily by competitive bidding or through negotiations with long-standing or prospective clients. Bidding activity, backlog and revenue resulting from the award of contracts to us may vary significantly from period to period. Contracts have durations from a few weeks to several months or in some cases more than a year.     Operations outside the United States may be subject to certain risks which ordinarily would not exist in the United States, including foreign currency restrictions, extreme exchange rate fluctuations, expropriation of assets, civil uprising and riots, availability of personnel and government audit. In 1999, local protesters looted and vandalized our facility near Port Harcourt, Nigeria, and interfered with our operations and progress on some ongoing projects. The Nigerian government intervened and restored order in the area. In 2000 there were periodic interruptions on some projects. We have successfully operated in Nigeria for the past 39 years with very favorable relationships with the local communities, and believe that we can continue to operate in the area. We have been active in South America since 1939. Venezuela is the largest oil producer in South America and has redirected its energy initiative to include development of its significant natural gas reserves. This new initiative should translate into more demand for our natural gas pipeline capabilities. However, the Venezuelan economy is highly inflationary and the government has introduced a new hydrocarbon law, which is viewed by both international and national petroleum industry leaders as unfriendly to future investment in this sector. The outcome of negotiations between the government and private industry to revise the law is uncertain, and significant new foreign investment is unlikely until the negotiations are complete.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Revenue Recognition: Percentage-of-Completion Method - A number of factors relating to our business affect the recognition of contract revenue. Revenue from fixed-price construction and engineering contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs, taking into consideration physical completion. Total estimated costs, and thus contract income, are impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, and the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation and politics, may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project's completion and thus the timing of income and revenue                                         27  recognition. Generally, we do not recognize income on a fixed-price contract until the contract is approximately 5% to 10% complete, depending upon the nature of the contract. Costs which are considered to be reimbursable are excluded from the percentage-of-completion calculation. Accrued revenue pertaining to reimbursables is limited to the cost of the reimbursables. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined. Revenue from change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work and claims is recognized when realization is reasonably assured. Revenue from unit-price contracts is recognized as earned. We believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a relatively long time horizon during which major contracts are completed and change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work and cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized.     All U.S. government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the client. In the event a contract would be terminated at the convenience of the client prior to completion, we will typically be compensated for progress up to the time of termination and any termination costs. In addition, many contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements with liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances that are within our control.     An example of a project involving many of the above factors is our project in Australia. The project in Australia was completed after July 1, 2000, the date on which liquidated damages were scheduled to commence under the contract. Due primarily to productivity and other labor issues, and anticipated liquidated damages, we recognized a contract loss of $14.5 million in 2000. However, during 2001, the client accepted claims for extension of the scheduled completion date, accepted other claims and requested additional services, resulting in contract amendments and the realization in 2001 of $4.2 million of contract income on the project.     Income Taxes - The determination of our tax provision is complex due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the United States which may be subject to certain risks which ordinarily would not be expected in the United States. Tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes which may be applied on a retroactive basis. If this were to occur, our tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported. Furthermore, in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, we estimate taxable income into the future and determine the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Future taxable income could be materially different than amounts estimated, in which case the valuation allowance would need to be adjusted.     Joint Venture Accounting - We have investments, ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent, in joint ventures that operate in similar lines of business as ours. Investments consist of a 10 percent interest in a consortium for work in Venezuela, a 35 percent interest in a joint venture for work in Australia and a 50 percent interest in a joint venture for work in Africa. Interests in these unconsolidated ventures are accounted for under the equity-method in the consolidated balance sheets and on a proportionate consolidation basis in the consolidated statements of operations. This presentation is consistent with construction industry practice. Alternatively, if we were to account for these interests using the equity-method in the consolidated statement of operations, revenue and contract cost would be materially lower; however, net income would not change.  SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS      On January 24, 2000, we acquired Rogers & Phillips, Inc. ("RPI"), a closely held pipeline construction company in Houston, Texas with an experienced management team and a strong market position in the U.S. Gulf Coast area. Founded in 1992, RPI provides a full range of construction services for pipeline operating companies, including station and piping projects in congested urban areas and inside plants, as well as cross-country pipelines. The consideration included 1,035,000 shares of our common stock and approximately $1.7 million in cash and acquisition costs. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. RPI contributed $85.9 million of revenue during 2001 and $39.4 million in 2000.      In September 2000, through a joint venture led by a subsidiary of ours, we were awarded a significant project, the scope of which includes the engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") of a 665-mile                                         28  (1,070-kilometer), 30-inch crude oil pipeline from the Doba Fields in Chad to an export terminal on the coast of Cameroon in Africa (the "Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project"). Engineering and procurement activities began in late 2000. Pipeline construction began in November 2001 and is expected to be completed in 2003.      During 2000, our activities in Nigeria included work on two major EPC contracts for Shell: (a) the Nembe Creek gas gathering pipeline system, and (b) four concrete barge-mounted gas compressor facilities for Shell's Nembe Creek Associated Gas project (collectively, the "Nembe Creek Projects"). At the end of 2001, both projects were nearing completion.     During 2000, Willbros USA, Inc. relocated its administrative headquarters and some construction support services from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Houston, Texas. The cost of the move, termination benefits, and office lease termination costs totaled approximately $4.5 million.     On October 12, 2001, we completed the purchase of MSI Energy Services Inc. ("MSI"), a Canadian general contractor whose common shares were listed on The Canadian Venture Exchange. MSI provides pipeline construction, pipeline integrity and maintenance services in addition to pipe storage and handling services, specialty metal fabrication services, pipeline equipment rentals and concrete construction products in the oil sands region of Northern Alberta, Canada. The aggregate purchase price, including transaction costs, was $8.3 million. In conjunction with the acquisition the Company sold 144,175 common shares from treasury for $1.9 million to certain MSI shareholders and the net cash paid of $6.4 million to purchase MSI was funded through borrowings under our principal credit agreement. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. MSI contributed $3.3 million of revenue during 2001.     During 2001, our engineering group executed an alliance agreement with Explorer Pipeline Company to provide project management, engineering, procurement and construction services for their Mainline Expansion Project in Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana (the "Explorer Pipeline Project"). This project includes construction of 12 grassroots pump stations, modifications at 12 existing pump stations, the addition of 500,000 barrels of storage at the Wood River, Illinois terminal and modifications at two other terminals. The project is scheduled for completion in 2002.  OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES     We use EBITDA (earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) as part of our overall assessment of financial performance by comparing EBITDA between accounting periods. We believe that EBITDA is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in businesses similar to ours. EBITDA for the year 2001 was $51.1 million, up $37.2 million from $13.9 million for 2000.     We define anticipated contract revenue as backlog when the award of a contract is reasonably assured, generally upon the execution of a definitive agreement or contract. Anticipated revenue from post-contract award processes, including change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work and the effect of escalation or currency fluctuation formulas, is not added to backlog until realization is reasonably assured. New contract awards totaled $423.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. Additions to backlog during the year were as follows: construction, $147.4 million; engineering, $219.9 million; and specialty services, $56.5 million. Backlog decreases by type of service as a result of services performed during the period were as follows: construction, $214.5 million; engineering, $120.3 million; and specialty services, $55.3 million. Backlog at the end of the year increased $33.7 million (9%) from the previous year end to $407.6 million and consisted of the following: (a) construction, $207.7 million, down $67.1 million (24%); (b) engineering, $154.6 million, up $99.6 million (181%); and (c) specialty services, $45.3 million, up $1.2 million (3%). Construction backlog consists primarily of the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project and construction projects in Offshore West Africa. Engineering backlog consists primarily of the Explorer Pipeline Project and other engineering and procurement projects in the United States. Specialty services backlog is largely attributable to a 16-year water injection contract awarded in 1998 to a consortium in which we have a 10 percent interest in Venezuela, contracts to build, own and operate four fueling facilities for the United States government, and service contracts in Oman and Canada.                                          29   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Our contract revenue and contract costs are primarily related to the timing and location of development projects in the oil, gas and power industries worldwide. Contract revenue and cost variations by country from year to year are the result of (a) entering and exiting work countries; (b) the execution of new contract awards; (c) the completion of contracts; and (d) the overall level of activity in our services.      Our ability to be successful in obtaining and executing contracts can be affected by the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar compared to the currencies of our competitors, our clients and our work locations. We do not believe that our revenue or results of operations were adversely affected in this regard during the years ended December 31, 2001 or 2000.            FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR                              ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000  CONTRACT REVENUE     Contract revenue increased $75.8 million (24%) to $390.1 million as a result of (a) increased engineering revenue of $61.6 million due to an increase in engineering and procurement services in the United States; and (b) increased construction revenue of $22.1 million due primarily to increased construction activity in the United States, Offshore West Africa and Cameroon partially offset by reduced activities on the Nembe Creek Projects in Nigeria as they neared completion in 2001 and the completion in the third quarter of 2000 of the construction contract in Australia. These increases in engineering and construction revenue were partially offset by a decrease of $7.9 million in specialty services revenue. Revenue in the United States increased $112.3 million (121%) due to an increase in engineering, procurement and construction services. Cameroon revenue increased $34.0 million as work on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project moved from the engineering, procurement and mobilization phases into the construction phase in November 2001. Offshore West Africa revenue increased $26.3 million (149%) due to higher utilization of the combination barge "Willbros 318" as well as utilization of the derrick barge "WB82" acquired in 2001. Revenue in Oman increased $1.4 million (11%). Canada revenue, from the MSI acquisition on October 12, 2001, was $3.3 million. Nigeria revenue decreased $75.6 million (53%) due to reduced activity on the Nembe Creek Projects. Australia revenue decreased $16.7 million (81%) due to the construction contract that was completed in 2000, net of $4.0 million from contract amendments and settled claims during 2001. Revenue in Venezuela decreased $9.2 million (35%).  CONTRACT COSTS     Contract costs increased $48.7 million (18%) to $315.7 million due to an increase of $51.9 million in engineering services cost and an increase in construction services cost of $8.1 million, partially offset by a decrease of $11.3 million in specialty services cost. Variations in contract cost by country were closely related to the variations in contract revenue, with the exception of Australia. Contract costs in Australia decreased by $35.4 million or $18.7 million more than the decrease in revenue primarily as a result of a $14.5 million loss recognized during 2000, offset by $4.2 million of settled claims in 2001.  TERMINATION OF BENEFIT PLANS     During 2001 we terminated two employee benefit plans which resulted in one-time, non-taxable gains of $9.2 million. These plans were costly to maintain and had become ineffective in the recruitment and retention of an experienced and qualified workforce.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION     Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.9 million to $19.5 million due primarily to the sale in 2000 of excess equipment in Venezuela, Indonesia, the United States and Oman, accelerated amortization of excess spare parts in Indonesia in 2000 and accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements of $0.8 million related to termination of our administrative office space in Tulsa, Oklahoma as a result of relocation of those offices to Houston, Texas.                                           30   GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE     General and administrative expense, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 7.7% in 2001 from 9.6% in 2000. On a dollar basis, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million to $30.0 million in 2001. This reduction is the result of the non-recurrence of the $3.6 million in expenses that were incurred in 2000 that were associated with the relocation of the administrative office to Houston, Texas. This reduction was offset by increased general and administrative expenses in 2001 as expansion in staffing and support services were necessary to support the 24% increase in revenue during the year.  OPERATING INCOME     Operating income increased $39.4 million from an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2000 to operating income of $34.1 million in 2001. For the reasons described above, operating income increased in Australia by $19.4 million (from an operating loss of $15.4 million in 2000), the United States by $14.8 million, Offshore West Africa by $9.2 million and Cameroon by $5.0 million. Additionally, we recognized $9.2 million of gains related to the termination of certain employee benefit plans. These improvements were offset by reduced operating income in Nigeria and Venezuela totaling $18.7 million. All other areas combined accounted for an increase of $0.5 million.  NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)     Net interest income (expense) decreased $0.2 million to $2.1 million net interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates during the period offset by higher average debt levels.  MINORITY INTEREST     Minority interest expense decreased $0.9 million to $1.5 million due to a decrease in activity in Nigeria where minority interest partners were involved.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAIN (LOSS)     Foreign exchange loss decreased $1.0 million to $0.1 million primarily due to the write-off during 2000 of cumulative translation adjustments associated with substantially reduced operations in Indonesia and other work countries.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)     Other income (expense) decreased $1.4 million to $1.0 million expense primarily due a full year of amortization of debt issue cost and losses on equipment disposals.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES     The provision for income taxes increased $5.1 million while pretax income increased $39.8 million. This is the result of increased taxes on higher taxable income in the United States offset by lower income taxes in Nigeria due to a decrease in taxable revenue in that country, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance in the United States by $2.3 million and settlement of $0.9 million of prior year taxes in Nigeria. In addition, we had $9.2 million of non-taxable gains in 2001 associated with the termination of benefit plans. The provision for income taxes is impacted by income taxes in certain countries, primarily Nigeria, being based on deemed profit rather than taxable income and the fact that losses in one country cannot be used to offset taxable income in another country.                                             31           FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR                              ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999  CONTRACT REVENUE     Contract revenue increased $137.7 million (78%) to $314.3 million due to (a) $124.6 million of increased construction revenue resulting primarily from new construction contracts in Nigeria, the United States and Offshore West Africa; and (b) an increase of $24.9 million in specialty services revenue, principally from operations in Nigeria, Oman and Venezuela; net of decreased engineering revenue of $11.8 million due to completion in early 2000 of the engineering portion of engineering, procurement and construction contracts in Nigeria. Nigeria revenue increased $67.1 million (88%) due to revenue from work performed on engineering, procurement and construction projects and increased specialty services work. Revenue in the United States increased $50.0 million (117%) primarily due to construction projects in Indiana, Illinois and Louisiana performed by RPI and increased engineering work. Offshore West Africa revenue increased $16.4 million due primarily to work performed on an engineering, procurement and construction project to install offshore pipelines and facilities. Oman revenue increased $4.9 million (61%) due to increased construction and service revenues. Venezuela revenue increased $2.6 million (11%) due to work performed on a water injection platform construction contract and several new service contracts. Australia revenue increased $1.9 million due to a construction contract started in the second half of 1999 and completed in July 2000. Indonesia revenue decreased $3.2 million (100%) and Ivory Coast revenue decreased $2.6 million (100%) due to the completion of work in 1999 on pipeline projects in those countries. Revenue in all other areas increased $0.6 million.  CONTRACT COSTS     Contract costs increased $121.5 million (84%) to $267.0 million due to an increase of $114.2 million in construction services cost, an increase of $15.8 million in specialty services costs and a decrease of $8.5 million in engineering services cost. Variations in contract costs by country were closely related to the variations in contract revenue, with the exception of Australia. Contract costs in Australia exceeded contract revenue by approximately $14.5 million.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION     Depreciation and amortization increased $1.1 million to $22.4 million due to $0.8 million of accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements related to the Company's vacated office space in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and $0.9 of increased amortization resulting from higher levels of spare parts purchases, offset by a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of the sale of excess equipment in Venezuela, Indonesia, the United States and Oman.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE     General and administrative expense increased $2.6 million (9%) to $30.2 million. This increase included $3.0 of general and administrative expense from RPI, which was acquired in January 2000, and $3.6 million in office relocation costs that were partially offset by a $4.0 million reduction in general and administrative expense as a result of personnel reductions and scaling back or eliminating activities.  OPERATING LOSS     Operating loss declined $12.5 million (70%) to an operating loss of $5.3 million. Increased operating income in Nigeria, Offshore West Africa, Oman, and the United States in the aggregate was $26.8 million. This improvement is primarily attributable to a 78 percent increase in revenue in 2000 over 1999. Offsetting the improvements in the above work countries was the increased operating loss in Australia of $14.3 million. This loss is primarily attributable to unanticipated labor difficulties and delays caused by weather and a subcontractor.  NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)     Net interest income decreased $2.5 million to $1.9 million net interest expense due to an increase in borrowings and higher interest rates during the period.                                          32  MINORITY INTEREST     Minority interest expense increased $0.9 million to $2.4 million due to an increase in activity in countries where minority interest partners were involved.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAIN (LOSS)     Foreign exchange loss increased $0.6 million to $1.1 million primarily due to the write-off of cumulative translation adjustments associated with substantially reduced operations in certain work countries.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)     Other income decreased $2.1 million to $0.4 million primarily due to gains on disposals of equipment in 1999 exceeding gains on disposals of equipment in 2000.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES     The provision for income taxes increased $2.0 million (61%) primarily due to the increase in taxable revenue in Nigeria, offset by a $1.2 million deferred tax benefit resulting from recognition in 2000 of a portion of the future tax benefit of operating loss carryforwards in the United States that were previously fully reserved through a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. Although we had a loss before income taxes, a provision for income taxes was required due to income taxes in certain countries being based on deemed profit rather than taxable income and the fact that losses in one country cannot be used to offset taxable income in another country.   EFFECT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES     Our operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation, government mandates or other economic factors, in the countries in which we operate. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain of our major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Our primary requirements for capital are to acquire, upgrade and maintain equipment, provide working capital for current projects, finance the mobilization of employees and equipment to new projects, establish a presence in countries where we perceive growth opportunities and finance the possible acquisition of new businesses and equity investments. Historically, we have met these capital requirements primarily from operating cash flows, and more recently from borrowings under our credit facility.       Cash and cash equivalents increased $7.4 million (62%) to $19.3 million at December 31, 2001, from $11.9 million at December 31, 2000. The increase was due to cash flows of $24.8 million from operations, $18.4 million from financing activities resulting from net borrowings, issuance of treasury stock and the exercise of employee stock options and $0.3 million from the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. These increases were offset by $36.1 million of investing activities primarily for the purchase of $28.8 million of equipment and spare parts and $7.4 million for the acquisition of MSI (net of cash acquired). Working capital increased $14.1 million during 2001 to $46.2 million at December 31, 2001. Our debt, net of cash balances, at December 31, 2001 was $20.0 million as compared to $14.4 million at December 31, 2000. Stockholders' equity increased $24.8 million to $96.6 million at December 31, 2001. As a result, our debt (net of cash) to equity ratio was basically unchanged from 20% at the end of 2000 to 21% at December 31, 2001.                                           33  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS     We have a $150 million credit agreement with a syndicated bank group, which was amended effective June 30, 2000. The credit agreement subjects the $100 million revolving portion of the credit facility to borrowing base requirements. The entire facility, less amounts used under the revolving portion of the facility, may be used for standby and commercial letters of credit. Borrowings are payable at termination on February 20, 2003. Interest is payable quarterly at a Base Rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.25% or a Eurodollar Rate plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 3.50%, depending upon our performance. A commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit agreement is payable quarterly ranging from 0.475% to 0.75%, depending upon our performance. The credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our assets, including stock of our principal subsidiaries. The credit agreement restricts the payment of cash dividends and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios, including among others, indebtedness to EBITDA, leverage, and interest coverage. The borrowing base is calculated using varying percentages of cash, accounts receivable, accrued revenue, contract cost and recognized income not yet billed, property, plant and equipment, and spare parts.     As of December 31, 2001, there was $39.0 million borrowed under the credit agreement at an average interest rate of 4.5% and $54.4 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $56.6 million available for a combination of borrowings and letters of credit.       At December 31, 2001, there were $0.1 million of notes payable issued by RPI to a bank, collateralized by vehicles and machinery, and payable in monthly installments of principal plus interest ranging from 6.7% to 9.0% per annum. The notes mature in 2002.     At December 31, 2001, MSI borrowed $0.1 million under a $1.5 million revolving credit facility with a bank. The credit facility is collateralized by a fabrication facility and some real estate and equipment. The facility matures in 2002.     In addition we have unsecured credit facilities with banks in certain countries outside the United States. Borrowings under these lines, in the form of short-term notes and overdrafts, are made at competitive local interest rates. Generally, each line is available only for borrowings related to operations in a specific country. Credit available under these facilities is approximately $9.3 million at December 31, 2001. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2001.     We have certain operating leases for office and camp facilities. Minimum lease commitments under operating leases as of December 31, 2001, totaled $4.5 million and are payable as follows: 2002, $1.3 million; 2003, $0.9 million; 2004, $0.8 million; 2005, $0.8 million; 2006, $0.6 million and later years, $0.1 million.     Based upon the above, our total cash obligations are payable as follows: 2002, $1.5 million; 2003, $39.9 million and later years, $2.3 million.  COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS     From time to time we enter into commercial commitments, usually in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit, insurance bonds and financial guarantees. Contracts with our customers may require us to provide letters of credit or insurance bonds with regard to our performance of contracted services. In such cases, the commitments can be called upon in the event of our failure to perform contracted services. Likewise, contracts may allow us to issue letters of credit or insurance bonds in lieu of contract retention provisions, in which the client withholds a percentage of the contract value until project completion or expiration of a warranty period. Retention commitments can be called upon in the event of warranty or project completion issues, as prescribed in the contracts. In connection with the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project joint venture, we issued a letter of credit to an equipment leasing company equal to 50% of total lease payments, our share of the joint venture. The letter of credit reduces                                         34  as lease payments are made and expires in October 2002. The commitment can be called upon as a result of failure to make lease payments.     In connection with our 10% interest in a joint venture in Venezuela, we issued a corporate guarantee equal to 10% of the joint venture's outstanding borrowings with two banks. The guarantee reduces as borrowings are repaid, and expires in March 2003. The commitment as of December 31, 2001 totals $3.8 million.     In 1997 we entered into lease agreements with a special-purpose leasing partnership for land and an office building for our engineering group in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The leases are treated for accounting purposes as operating leases. The initial terms of the leases were for five years with 30 one-year renewal options, and end in August 2002. At the end of the initial terms of the leases, we can extend the leases with the agreement of the lessor, purchase the leased assets for $5.5 million or terminate the leases and cause the assets to be sold. If the assets are sold, the cash proceeds from the sale in excess of $5.5 million will be paid to us by the landlord. In the event cash proceeds are less than $5.5 million, we will make up the shortfall up to a maximum of $4.7 million. Currently, we believe the fair market value of the property is equal to or greater than $5.5 million.     A summary of our off-balance sheet commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001 is as follows:                                                                             AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT                                                                          EXPIRATION PER PERIOD                                                                          ---------------------                                                           TOTAL         LESS THAN       OVER 2                                                        COMMITMENT        2 YEARS        YEARS        Letters of Credit:    Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project - performance           $31.9          $31.9          $  --    Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project - equipment lease        12.9           12.9             --    Other - performance and retention                        9.6            9.6             --                                                           -----          -----          -----    Total letters of credit                                 54.4           54.4             --                                                           -----          -----          -----  Insurance Bonds - primarily performance related:    Expiring                                                 6.7            6.7             --    Non-expiring                                             2.5             --            2.5                                                           -----          -----          -----    Total insurance bonds                                    9.2            6.7            2.5                                                           -----          -----          -----  Corporate guarantee                                         3.8            3.8             -- Lease residual value guarantee                              4.7            4.7             --                                                           -----          -----          ----- Total commercial commitments                              $72.1          $69.6          $ 2.5                                                           =====          =====          =====       We do not anticipate any significant collection problems with our customers, including those in countries that may be experiencing economic and/or currency difficulties. Since our customers generally are major oil companies and government entities, and the terms for billing and collecting for work performed are generally established by contracts, we historically have a very low incidence of collectability problems.     We believe that cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to finance working capital and capital expenditures for ongoing operations. We estimate capital expenditures for equipment and spare parts to be approximately $25.0 to $35.0 million in 2002. In analyzing our cash flow from operations, we believe that while there are numerous factors that could and will have an impact on our cash flow, both positively and negatively; there is not one or two events that should they occur could not be funded from our operations or borrowing capacity. For a list of risk factors that could impact cash flow, please refer to the sections titled "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Political and Economic Risks; Operational Risks" contained in this Form 10-K.                                         35       During 1998 and 1999, we repurchased and held in treasury 2,175,371 shares of Common Stock for $16.1 million. We did not repurchase any shares in 2000 or 2001. In January 2000, 1,035,000 shares of treasury stock were issued in connection with the acquisition of RPI. In October 2001, 144,175 shares of treasury stock were issued in connection with the acquisition of MSI. As of December 31, 2001, a total of 996,196 shares remain in treasury stock at an average price of $7.43 per share.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires, among other things, that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 requires, among other things, that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives acquired after June 30, 2001 no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired before July 1, 2001 will continue to be amortized until adoption of SFAS No. 142.       We are required to fully adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $38 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2000, and $47 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2001. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 142 to have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations.       In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method. We will adopt SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003. The transition adjustment, if any, will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of the adoption of this statement on either our financial position or results of operations.       In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, but retains its fundamental provisions for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 generally are required to be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 144 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Our primary market risk is our exposure to changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates. We attempt to negotiate contracts which provide for payment in U.S. dollars, but we may be required to take all or a portion of payment under a contract in another currency. To mitigate non-U.S. currency exchange risk, we seek to match anticipated non-U.S. currency revenue with expenses in the same currency whenever possible. To the extent we are unable to match non-U.S. currency revenue with expenses in the same currency, we may use forward contracts, options or other common hedging techniques in the same non-U.S. currencies. We had no forward contracts or options at December 31, 2001 and 2000.       The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value at December 31, 2001 due to the generally short maturities of these items. We invest primarily in short-term dollar denominated bank deposits, and at December 31, 2001 did not have any investment in instruments with a maturity of more than a few days or in any equity securities. We have the ability and expect to hold our investments to maturity.       Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt. At December 31, 2001, $39.0 million of indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates. The weighted                                         36  average effective interest rate on the variable rate debt for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 was 7.6%. The detrimental effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be to reduce income before income taxes by $0.3 million for the twelve-month period.                                         37  ITEM 8.
