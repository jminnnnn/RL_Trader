ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS      OF OPERATIONS    (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS OR UNLESS NOTED OTHERWISE)       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  OVERVIEW  RESTATEMENT       In late December of 2004, the Company became aware of an approximate $2.5 million tax assessment against the Company's Bolivian subsidiary which alleged that the subsidiary had filed improper tax returns. The assessment also imposed penalties and interest related to the tax assessment. Prior to late December 2004, the executive management of the Company was unaware of the tax assessment, with the exception of J. Kenneth Tillery, the then President of Willbros International, Inc. ("WII"), the primary international subsidiary of the Company. Mr. Tillery resigned from the Company on January 6, 2005.       Upon learning of the tax assessment, the Company immediately commenced an initial investigation into the matter and notified the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee retained independent counsel, who in turn retained forensic accountants, and began an independent investigation.       Concurrent with the Audit Committee's investigation, the Company initiated its own review of the Company's accounting. This review focused primarily on the Company's international activities supervised by the former President of WII, but also included other areas of the Company's accounting activities.       As a result of the investigation by the Audit Committee and the Company's accounting review, the Company determined that several members of the senior management of WII and its subsidiaries collaborated to misappropriate assets from the Company and cover up such activity. It was determined that the Bolivian subsidiary had in fact filed improper tax returns, or failed to file returns, at the direction of Mr. Tillery, the former President of WII. The investigation also determined that Mr. Tillery, in collusion with several members of the management of the international subsidiaries, was involved in other improper activities, primarily in the Company's Nigerian subsidiaries. The improper activities which significantly impacted the Company's consolidated financial statements, include:       -    Understatement and underpayment of value added taxes (VAT) and payroll           related taxes with resultant penalties and interest at certain           international subsidiaries of $8,714 for the period from 1999 through           December 2003 ($2,658 in 2003, $3,596 in 2002 and $2,460 in prior           periods;       -    The existence of previously undisclosed and unknown multiple related           party affiliations and transactions with entities in which the former           President of WII and other members of management of the international           subsidiaries operating in Nigeria had an ownership interest or exerted           significant influence. As disclosed in Note 18 to the Consolidated           Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, previously           undisclosed related party transactions totaled $24,077 for the two           year period ended 2003, which transactions and services may not have           been based on market terms or rates and/or the Company may not have           received appropriate benefit from such arrangements;       -    Misappropriation of $5,847 in cash funds for the period from 1999           through December 2003 ($1,500 in 2003, $1,534 in 2002 and $2,813 in           prior periods), through the use of fraudulent vendor invoices in           Nigeria which resulted in an overstatement of fixed assets, and timing           differences in the recognition of contract revenue on fixed price           contracts;       -    Misappropriation of $2,356 in cash funds for the period 2002 through           2003 ($814 in 2003 and $1,542 in 2002) through the use of fraudulent           consulting agreements in Nigeria, which resulted in an overstatement           of contract costs (subsequently reclassified as other operating costs)           and timing differences in the recognition of contract revenue on fixed           priced contracts.       -    Overstatement of estimated contract margins for several significant           Nigeria contracts resulting in an overstatement of contract margins           and in timing differences in the recognition of contract revenue on           fixed price contracts;       -    Overstatement of costs incurred and anticipated recovery of a           significant contract change order resulting in an overstatement of           contract revenue and margin of $3,664;       -    Overstatement of net accounts receivable, as a result of inaccurate           information provided by several members of management of international           subsidiaries resulting in an understatement of bad debt expense of           approximately $6,737; and       -    Misappropriation of funds to refurbish equipment not owned by the           Company charged to contract costs in the amount of approximately           $2,182.       The Company's review of its historical accounting also identified accounting errors which are corrected in the Company's restated consolidated financial statements and include:                                          41        -    An error in determining the price used for the Company's common stock           issued as partial consideration in connection with an acquisition in           2002;       -    An error in the treatment of an earn-out payment in connection with a           2002 acquisition classified as a purchase price adjustment instead of           compensation expense;       -    An error in the computation of the accretion of interest on discount           on notes receivable for stock purchases;       -    An error in the amortization period used to amortize debt issuance           costs;       -    An error in the accounting period used to reverse an excess accrual of           minority interest;       -    An error in revenue resulting from the recording of duplicate           invoices;       -    An error in the tax rate used to recognize deferred tax assets;       -    An error in the recognition of withholding tax expense;       -    An error in the application of accounting for loss contracts corrected           by a reclassification of contract revenue and contract costs;       -    An error in the carrying value and classification of parts           inventories; and       -    Corrections with respect to the income tax consequences on the matters           identified and corrected as a result of the investigation and the           accounting review.       Financial statement adjustments resulting from the misconduct of certain members of the international subsidiaries management had a negative impact on the Company's consolidated cumulative earnings (loss) through December 31, 2003 of approximately ($13,307). The impact on the Company's consolidated cumulative earnings (loss) through December 31, 2003 for other accounting errors noted above decreased earnings by approximately ($5). The total impact on the Company's consolidated cumulative earnings (loss) of all financial statement adjustments through December 31, 2003 was approximately ($13,312). The impact of these items on the Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 and its statements of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are presented below. The impact on the 2004 and 2003 interim periods are included in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.       The significant items having financial statement impact as of December 31, 2003 and all restated annual periods prior to 2004 are as follows:       -    Decrease in contract revenue of $3,038 for the 2002 and 2003 restated           periods;       -    Decrease in operating income for the 2002 and 2003 restated annual           periods of $10,355;       -    Increase in other income (expense) net of ($643) for the 2002 and 2003           restated annual periods;       -    Increase in income taxes of $1,549 for the 2002 and 2003 restated           annual periods;       -    Reduction in stockholders' equity of $15,754, of which $13,312           represented a deduction in retained earnings;       -    Reduction in goodwill, with corresponding reduction in           capital-in-excess of par of $2,841 and a reduction in retained           earnings of $294, relating to an error in the price used for Company           common stock issued as partial consideration in connection with an           acquisition in 2002; and       -    Increase of $7,179 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an           increase of $1,827 in accrued income taxes.       Additional information regarding these accounting corrections is provided in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  2004 GENERAL       We derive our revenue from providing engineering, construction, specialty services and development activities to the oil, gas and power industries and government entities worldwide. In 2004, our revenue was primarily generated from operations in Canada, Iraq, Nigeria, Oman, and the United States. We obtain contracts for our work primarily by competitive bidding or through negotiations with long-standing or prospective clients. Our contracts have durations from a few weeks to several months or in some cases more than a year.       We believe the fundamentals supporting the demand for engineering and construction services for the oil, gas and power industries indicate the market for our services will be strong for the next two to five years. We expect the international demand for our services to continue to be strong. We expect the demand for our services in the United States and Canada to improve into 2006. An industry survey appears to substantiate our outlook as they are suggesting that planned worldwide pipeline construction will be slightly higher in 2005 than in 2004. Overall the survey indicates an increase of 1,000 miles of planned miles of pipeline construction from approximately 59,000 miles in 2004 and beyond to approximately 60,000 miles in 2005 and beyond. More significant is the increase in planned expenditures identified by the survey. Respondents plan to build more than 51,000 miles of pipeline at a cost of more than $27.5 billion in 2005. This compares to more than 13,000 miles planned in 2004 at a cost of more than $19.0 billion. Our bidding                                         42   activity also substantiates our outlook for the near-term as we continue to see an increase in prospects that we believe fit with our capabilities and qualifications from approximately $5 billion at the end of 2003 to approximately $7 billion at the end of 2004.  FINANCIAL SUMMARY       For the year ended December 31, 2004, we had a net loss of ($20,815) or $(0.99) per share on revenue of $483,318. This compares to revenue of $416,573 in 2003 with net loss of ($10,917) or $(0.53) per share.       Our 2004 revenue was up 16.0 percent from 2003, primarily driven by improving market conditions in both International and United States & Canada business segments. See Note 15 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding segment reporting. The increase in revenue is attributable to the following:       -    A new maintenance contract in the Canadian oil sands;       -    The commencement of operation in the first quarter of 2004 of the Opal           Gas Plant in Wyoming;       -    The commencement of work on the Eastern Gas Gathering System ("EGGS")           project in Nigeria; and       -    The continuation of our work related to rebuilding pipeline           infrastructure in Iraq.       Contract margin for the year increased to 13.6 percent of revenue from 10.1 percent in 2003. This improvement in contract margin is the result of the following:       -    The Opal Gas Plant commencing operations in the first quarter of 2004;       -    Improved contract margins realized on work performed in the Middle           East; and       -    Settlement of contract claims on projects in Bolivia and Venezuela           which were substantially completed in 2003.       In addition to the positive factors impacting our contract margin in 2004 listed above, we did not encounter the heavy rain and inclement weather on our projects in the United States in 2004 that we did in 2003 which negatively impacted our contract margin in 2003.       Offsetting these factors, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $6,737 due to delays in collection of our accounts receivable, primarily in West Africa, and the anticipated discounted sale of an aged receivable.       General and Administrative ("G&A") expense increased $10,314 in 2004 from 2003 due primarily to more resources dedicated to bidding, estimating, supporting existing projects, and regulatory compliance. G&A expense was also higher as we supported the implementation of a new management information system in the United States and Canada. We expect to complete the implementation of the new management information system in the remaining business units in early 2006.       The provision for income taxes for 2004 of $10,064 was primarily the result of:       -    Income tax expense on foreign earnings of $3,641;       -    Income tax expense on foreign deemed income of $8,483; and       -    Income tax benefit on operating losses in the United States of           ($2,060).       In 2004, our cash and cash equivalents increased from $20,969 to $78,720 and our long-term debt increased from $18,322 to $73,495. These changes were primarily due to the following:       -    Proceeds from the issuance of the $70,000, 2.75 percent Convertible           Senior Notes due 2024;       -    $40,969 provided by operating activities primarily attributable to           improved working capital management; and       -    Investment of $38,479 in capital assets associated with the expansion           of our fabrication facilities in Nigeria and Canada, expansion of our           housing and office facilities in Nigeria, the implementation of a new           information technology system in the United States and Canada, and the           normal replacement of our equipment.       In the first quarter of 2004, we completed two financing transactions which we believe will improve our liquidity and, combined with cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to finance our working capital and                                          43   capital expenditure requirements for our current operations. In March and April, 2004, we issued $70,000 of 2.75 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the "Convertible Notes") due 2024. Also, on March 12, 2004, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facility. The three-year amended and restated credit facility (the "2004 Credit Facility") initially provided for $150,000 of available credit capacity to be used for letters of credit and cash borrowing. On July 19, 2005, the Company entered into a Second Amendment and Waiver Agreement ("Waiver Amendment") of the 2004 Credit Facility with the syndicated bank group to obtain continuing waivers regarding its non-compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants in the 2004 Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Waiver Amendment, the total credit availability under the 2004 Credit Facility is reduced to $100,000 as of the effective date of the Waiver Amendment. (See the related discussion in this Item 7 under "Liquidity and Capital Resources").  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  REVENUE RECOGNITION; PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION METHOD       A number of factors relating to our business affect the recognition of contract revenue. Revenue from fixed-price construction and engineering contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs, taking into consideration physical completion. Total estimated costs, and thus contract income, are impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, and the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation and politics, may affect the progress of a project's completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition. We do not recognize income on a fixed-price contract until the contract is approximately 5 percent to 10 percent complete, depending upon the nature of the contract. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined. Also included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on uncompleted contracts are amounts the Company seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design, contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs (unapproved change orders). These amounts are recorded at their estimated net realizable value when realization is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated recoverable amounts of recorded unapproved change orders may be made in the near-term. If the Company does not successfully resolve these matters, a net expense (recorded as a reduction in revenues), may be required, in addition to amounts that have been previously provided for. Revenue from unit-price and time and material contracts is recognized as earned. Revenue from operations of the Opal Gas Plant is recognized upon delivery of product to the customer. We believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work and cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized.       All U.S. government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the client. In the event a contract would be terminated at the convenience of the client prior to completion, we will typically be compensated for progress up to the time of termination and any termination costs. Many contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements which require us to pay liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances that are within our control. In addition, some contracts provide for bonus payments to us for early completion of the project and/or attainment of specified safety goals.  INCOME TAXES       The determination of our tax provision is complex due to our operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the United States which may be subject to certain risks which ordinarily would not be expected in the United States. Tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes which may be applied on a retroactive basis. If this were to occur, our tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported. Furthermore, in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, we estimate taxable income into the future and determine the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Future taxable income could be materially different than amounts estimated, in which case the valuation allowance would need to be adjusted.                                          44    JOINT VENTURE ACCOUNTING       From time to time, we seek one or more joint venture partners when a project requires local content, equipment, manpower or other resources beyond those we have available to complete work in a timely and efficient manner or when we wish to share risk on a particularly large project. We have investments, ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent, in joint ventures that operate in similar lines of business as ours. Investments consist of a 10 percent interest in a consortium for work in Venezuela, and a 50 percent interest in a joint venture for work in Africa in 2002 and 2003. Interests in these unconsolidated ventures are accounted for under the equity method in the consolidated balance sheets and on a proportionate consolidation basis in the consolidated statements of operations. This presentation is consistent with construction industry practice. Alternatively, if we were to account for these interests using the equity method in the consolidated statement of operations, revenue and contract cost would be materially lower; however, net income would not change.  SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS       In late March 2004, we commenced commercial production from our newly constructed Opal Gas Plant, located near Opal, Wyoming. This gas plant adds a new source of long-term revenue to complement our revenue stream from our project work. In 2003, we completed agreements with Williams Gas Processing Company ("Williams") that allowed us to design and construct our Opal Gas Plant. The plant is designed to process approximately 350,000 MCF per day of natural gas, producing 294,000 to 462,000 gallons per day of natural gas liquids at various operating conditions. We receive a $0.0175 per MCF processing fee under a 10-year contract through March 2014, and net approximately 38.8% of the liquids sales after payment to Williams for the contracted operations of the Opal Gas Plant.       In July 2004, Willbros Nigeria Ltd., with operations based in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, was awarded an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction ("EPC") contract to design and build a new gas transmission pipeline for Shell Petroleum Development Company. The 40-inch diameter, high pressure natural gas pipeline will be routed between the Soku gas plant and the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas ("NLNG") terminal on Bonny Island in Nigeria, a distance of approximately 83 kilometers. The pipeline is part of the EGGS project, and the contract is valued at approximately $246,000. Completion is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005.       In mid-August 2004, Willbros (Offshore) Nigeria Limited ("WONL") and Willbros West Africa, Inc. ("WWAI") received a letter of intent ("LOI") from Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited ("MPNU") to commence preliminary engineering and design work for the EPC-IV project located offshore West Africa. The EPC-IV contract, encompassing both fixed sum and time and material work is projected to have a value of approximately $200,000. MPNU has entered into separate contracts for work inside Nigeria with WONL and work outside of Nigeria with WWAI. The project covers the retrofitting and revamping of facilities on existing offshore platforms. Engineering and procurement activities began in 2004. Field work is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2005 and continue through 2006.       In December 2004, WWAI was awarded an EPC contract for the onshore pipeline and facilities of the 693-kilometer West African Gas Pipeline Project by the West African Pipeline Company Limited, comprised of Chevron, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell, and the Takoradi Power Company Ltd. of Ghana. The project includes the installation of custody transfer metering in Nigeria and a 30-inch natural gas pipeline from the existing Escravos Lagos gas pipeline system, near Itoki, Nigeria, to the initial compressor station at Lagos Beach, and the point of departure for the offshore section. Additional pipelines and regulating and metering facilities for the onshore portions of the project in Benin, Togo, and Ghana are included in the project scope, as well as the engineering, procurement, construction and tie-in of the initial compressor station and land pipeline section. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the project were held at Takoradi, Ghana, on December 3, 2004. Engineering and procurement activities for the onshore portions commenced in January 2005, with field activities scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2005, and project completion scheduled for fourth quarter of 2006.       In January 2005, J. Kenneth Tillery, President of Willbros International, Inc., resigned from the Company after management learned that the tax authorities in Bolivia assessed its local subsidiary approximately $2,500 on a completed project. (See the first risk factor under "Risk Factors" in Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K.) Subsequent to Mr. Tillery's resignation, R. Clay Etheridge was named President of Willbros International, Inc.                                          45    OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES  EBITDA       We use EBITDA (earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) as part of our overall assessment of financial performance by comparing EBITDA between accounting periods. We believe that EBITDA is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in businesses similar to ours. EBITDA for 2004 was $8,530 as compared to $2,073 in 2003. The $6,457 increase in EBITDA is primarily the result of:       -    Increased contract income of approximately $14.5 million due to           improved contract margins in 2004 over 2003 of 3.5 percentage points,           and       -    Increased contract income in 2004 over 2003 of approximately $9.1           million due to a $66.7 million increase in 2004 over 2003 revenue,           offset by       -    Increased G&A expense of $10.3 million in 2004 over 2003, and       -    Increased other expense of $6.5 million in 2004 over 2003.       A reconciliation of EBITDA to GAAP financial information can be found in Item 6 "Selected Financial Data" of this Form 10-K.  BACKLOG       In our industry, backlog is considered an indicator of potential future performance because it represents a portion of the future revenue stream. Our strategy is not focused solely on backlog additions but, rather, on capturing quality backlog with margins commensurate with the risks associated with a given project.       Backlog consists of anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts and contracts whose award is reasonably assured. At December 31, 2004, backlog was $660,932 with an estimated embedded margin of 21.6%, compared to $223,531 with an estimated embedded margin of 29.6% at December 31, 2003. We believe the backlog figures are firm, subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in various contracts. We expect that approximately $450,000, or about two-thirds, of our existing backlog at December 31, 2004, will be recognized in revenue during 2005. Historically, a substantial amount of our revenue in a given year has not been in our backlog at the beginning of that year. Additionally, due to the short duration of many jobs, revenue associated with jobs performed within a reporting period will not be reflected in backlog. We generate revenue from numerous sources, including contracts of long or short duration entered into during a year as well as from various contractual processes, including change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work and the effect of escalation or currency fluctuation formulas. These revenue sources are not added to backlog until realization is assured.                                          46         The following table shows our backlog by segment and geographic region as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:                                                   2004             2003 RESTATED                                         ------------------   ------------------                                          Amount    Percent    Amount    Percent                                         --------   -------   --------   -------                                              (Dollar amounts in thousands)          BACKLOG International    Africa ...........................   $554,692      84%    $ 49,018      22%    South America ....................     12,211       2       23,369      10    Middle East ......................      2,500      <1       57,853      26                                         --------     ---     --------     ---    Subtotal International ...........    569,403      86      130,240      58  United States & Canada    United States ....................     68,926      10       53,582      24    Canada ...........................     22,603       4       39,709      18                                         --------     ---     --------     ---    Subtotal United States & Canada ..     91,529      14       93,291      42                                         --------     ---     --------     ---    Total ............................   $660,932     100%    $223,531     100%                                         ========     ===     ========     ===   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004, we restructured our business into two operating segments, International and United States & Canada.       Our contract revenue and contract costs are significantly impacted by the capital budgets of our clients and the timing and location of development projects in the oil, gas and power industries worldwide. Contract revenue and cost variations by country from year-to-year are the result of entering and exiting work countries; the execution of new contract awards; the completion of contracts; and the overall level of activity related to our services.                        FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004,                  COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003  CONTRACT REVENUE       Contract revenue increased $66,745 (16.0%) to $483,318 in 2004 from $416,573 in 2003.

Increased revenue in 2004 resulted from the start of the EGGS project in Nigeria ($62,313) and continued work related to rebuilding Iraq ($43,972) that was completed in 2004. These increases were offset by the 2003 completion of the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline project which resulted in a year-to-year construction revenue decline of $61,269. The completion of several Nigerian projects also contributed to revenue reductions from 2003. Venezuela and Oman revenue also decreased from 2003.       United States & Canada revenue increased $38,462 or 24.9 percent in 2004 to $192,794, from $154,332 in 2003. The primary reasons for the increase in 2004 were the start-up of operations of the new Opal Gas Plant in Wyoming (approximately $21,216) and the expanded Albian Sands maintenance contract in Canada (approximately $8,766).                                          47    CONTRACT INCOME       Contract income increased $23,516 or 55.8 percent to $65,647 in 2004 from $42,131 in 2003. Variations in contract costs by country were closely related to the variations in contract revenue.

This decrease in contract margin is despite the settlement of the claim on the Transierra Project in Bolivia that positively impacted contract income in 2004 by $6,308. Based on the findings related to the investigation into the Company's former President of WII's activities contract income in 2004 and 2003 was negatively impacted by approximately $4,265 and $360 respectively. Margins for 2004 and 2003 were reduced by approximately 1.5% and 0.1%, respectively.       United States & Canada contract income increased $21,221 as margins greatly improved from last year on engineering and construction activity. Three factors resulted in this improvement in the margins. First, our construction projects in the United States were not as negatively impacted by weather in 2004 as they had been in 2003. Second, our revenue was up over 2003, which resulted in increased contract income. And, finally, our new Opal Gas Plant commenced operations in the first quarter of 2004 and contributed $5,464 of contract income.  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE       Depreciation and amortization increased $1,177 (7.6 percent) in 2004 due to the acquisition of $38,479 in assets in 2004 and a change in the mix of assets and depreciable lines of our property, plant and equipment. International depreciation increased from $8,727 to $9,135 or 4.7 percent. United States & Canada depreciation and amortization increased from $6,843 to $7,612 or 11.2 percent.       G&A expense increased $10,314 or 28.4 percent to $46,614 in 2004 compared to $36,300 in 2003. The increase is a result of more resources dedicated to bidding, estimating, and supporting existing projects, regulatory compliance, litigation costs, and the implementation of a new accounting system. International G&A increased from $16,321 to $22,600. United States & Canada G&A increased from $19,979 to $24,014.       Other operating costs, representing fraudulent expenses identified in our investigation, as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K, increased from $2,314 to $3,571 in 2004.   NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)       Net interest expense, including amortization of debt issue cost, increased $1,813 to $2,534 in 2004 from $721 in 2003. This increase is a direct result of interest on the $70,000 of Convertible Notes issued in the first quarter of 2004. Interest income increased $270 in 2004 as compared to 2003 as a result of an overall increase in invested funds in 2004 as compared to 2003.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)       Other expense increased $5,488 to $6,932 in 2004 from $1,444 in 2003, primarily as a result of the $6,737 increase in bad debt expense and partially offset by foreign currency gain of $1,037.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES       The provision for income taxes in 2004 increased $13,365 as compared to 2003. This increase in the provision for income taxes is due to improved operating results in countries where income taxes are calculated on actual pre-tax earnings, increase in revenue in Nigeria where taxes are based upon deemed income, and an increase in the allowance against deferred tax assets in Bolivia.                                          48                          FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003,                  COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002  CONTRACT REVENUE       Contract revenue decreased $166,256 (28.5 percent) to $416,573 in 2003 from $582,829 in 2002.

International revenue in 2003 was $262,241 versus $337,592 in 2002. The decline in International revenue is attributable to the completion of the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline in the first half of the year as well as the completion of the Bolivia Transierra Pipeline. The completion of these two projects resulted in a combined decrease in International revenue of $118,929 in 2003 from 2002. This decrease was partially offset by increased revenue related to the Venezuelan Ameriven project ($22,101) and increased activity in Oman ($23,641).       United States & Canada revenue decreased $90,905 or 37.1 percent in 2003 to $154,332 from $245,237 in 2002. Contributing to the decrease in 2003 was the significant decline in engineering services. Engineering revenue decreased approximately $140,000 in 2003 as compared to 2002. This decrease was partially offset by additional construction revenue in the U.S. and Canada, primarily as a result of including the Mt. West Group's revenue for a full year in 2003.  CONTRACT INCOME       Contract income decreased $46,380 or 52.4 percent to $42,131 in 2003 from $88,511 in 2002.

Contract income in 2003 and 2002 was negatively impacted by approximately $360 and $228, respectively, based on findings related to the investigation into the Company's former President of WII's activities. Contract margins for 2003 and 2002 were reduced by approximately 0.1% and 0.1% respectively.       United States & Canada contract income decreased $34,687 as a result of the large decline in revenue for the segment and a significant decrease in contract margins for the segment. Margins were negatively impacted by the depressed market conditions in the United States as well as poor weather on construction projects in the southern United States.  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE       Depreciation and amortization decreased $1,057 (6.4%) primarily due to a change in the mix of assets and depreciable lines of our property, plant, and equipment. International depreciation and amortization decreased $1,970 (18.4%) from $10,697 to $8,727. United States & Canada depreciation and amortization increased $913 (15.4%) from $5,930 to $6,843.                                          49         G&A expense increased $2,254 (6.6%) to $36,300. International G&A expense increased $130 (0.8%) from $16,191 to $16,321 and is partially offset by reductions in Venezuela. United States & Canada G&A expense increased $2,124 (11.9%) from $17,855 to $19,979. This increase resulted from a full year of G&A expense for the Mt. West Group acquired on October 23, 2002 and is partially offset by U.S. engineering G&A expense. We did incur higher G&A expense in 2003 over 2002 in the following areas: bidding and estimating; insurance; legal; and consulting.       Other operating costs, representing fraudulent expenses identified in our investigation, as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K, decreased from $3,076 in 2002 to $2,314 in 2003.  NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)       Net interest expense decreased $464 to $721 in 2003 from $1,185 in 2002. Interest expense was $327 less than 2002 because of reduced debt and capitalized interest related to the construction of our Opal Gas Plant. Interest income increased $137 in 2003 as compared to 2002.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)       Other expense decreased $342 to $1,444 in 2003 from $1,786 in 2002. The $342 decrease is the result of a $343 gain on the disposal of equipment in 2003 following a $281 loss in 2002, a $236 reduction in foreign currency translation losses in 2003 versus 2002, and the occurrence in 2003 of $518 of miscellaneous expense which were not incurred in 2002.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES       The provision for income taxes in 2003 decreased $10,186 as compared to 2002 mainly as a result of a $37,688 decrease in pre-tax income in the United States. The decrease in pre-tax income in the United States resulted in a $10,116 decrease in income tax expense in 2003 from 2002. The income tax expense on foreign earnings for 2003 also decreased by $70 when compared to 2002. These decreases in income tax expense were partially offset by a $4,946 increase in income tax expense associated with the change in the deferred tax valuation allowance between the two years.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS       Our primary requirements for capital are to acquire, upgrade and maintain equipment, provide working capital for current projects, finance the mobilization of employees and equipment to new projects, establish a presence in countries where we perceive growth opportunities and finance the possible acquisition of new businesses and equity investments. Historically, we have met these capital requirements primarily from operating cash flows, borrowings under our credit facility, and debt and equity financings.  WORKING CAPITAL       Cash and cash equivalents increased $57,751 (275.4%) to $78,720 at December 31, 2004, from $20,969 at December 31, 2003. The increase is primarily the result of the issuance of $70,000 of the Convertible Notes less the $14,000 repayment of the outstanding balance on the June 2002 credit agreement and the payment of $6,176 of debt issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes and the 2004 Credit Facility. Additionally, $40,969 of cash was provided by operating activities. This increase was partially offset by an investment of $38,479 in capital assets associated with the expansion of our fabrication facilities in Nigeria and Canada, expansion of our housing and office facilities in Nigeria, the implementation of a new information technology system in the United States and Canada, and the normal replacement of our equipment.       Working capital increased $24,915 (29.8%) to $108,643 at December 31, 2004 from $83,728 at December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash of $57,751.       We believe the anticipated increase in revenue, a focus on reducing working capital requirements, and more stringent criteria in our analysis in the area of capital asset addition will improve cash flow from operations in 2005.                                          50    2004 CREDIT FACILITY       On March 12, 2004, the existing $125,000 June 2002 credit agreement was amended, restated and increased to $150,000 (the "2004 Credit Facility"). The 2004 Credit Facility matures on March 12, 2007. The 2004 Credit Facility may be used for standby and commercial letters of credit, borrowings or a combination thereof. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of 40 percent of the borrowing base or $30,000 and are payable at termination on March 12, 2007. Interest is payable quarterly at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75 percent to 2.00 percent or a Eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75 percent to 3.00 percent. A commitment fee on the unused portion of the 2004 Credit Facility is payable quarterly, ranging from 0.375 percent to 0.625 percent. The 2004 Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company's assets, including stock of the principal subsidiaries, prohibits the payment of cash dividends and requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios. The borrowing base is calculated using varying percentages of cash, accounts receivable, accrued revenue, contract cost and recognized income not yet billed, property, plant and equipment, and spare parts. Unamortized debt issue costs of $2,933 and $1,512 associated with the 2004 Credit Facility are included in other assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Debt issue costs are amortized over the term of the 2004 Credit Facility ending March 2007.       As of December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the 2004 Credit Facility and there were $60,163 in outstanding letters of credit. Letters of credit reduce the availability on the facility by 75 percent of their amount outstanding; however, the total value of letters of credit outstanding may not exceed $150,000 (see "Waiver Amendment" below).  2004 Credit Facility Waivers       For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, due to the Company's operating results and EBITDA (earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) levels, an Amendment and Waiver Agreement (the "Waiver Agreement") was obtained from the syndicated bank group to waive non-compliance with a financial covenant to the credit agreement at June 30, 2004 and to amend certain financial covenants. The Waiver Agreement provides for an amendment of certain quarterly financial covenants and the multiple of EBITDA calculation with respect to the borrowing base determination through September 30, 2005.       In January 2005, the Company obtained a Consent and Waiver from its syndicated bank group, covering a period through June 29, 2005, waiving certain defaults and covenants which related to the filing of tax returns, the payment of taxes when due, tax liens and legal proceedings against the Company related to a tax assessment in Bolivia. (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Additional Consent and Waivers were obtained from the syndicated bank group as of April 8, 2005 and June 13, 2005 with respect to these defaults and non-compliance with certain financial covenants as of June 13, 2005.  2004 Credit Facility Amendment       On July 19, 2005, the Company entered into a Second Amendment and Waiver Agreement ("Waiver Amendment") of the 2004 Credit Facility with the syndicated bank group to obtain continuing waivers regarding its non-compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants in the 2004 Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Waiver Amendment, the total credit availability under the 2004 Credit Facility is reduced to $100,000 as of the effective date of the Waiver Amendment. Subject to certain conditions, the bank group agreed to permanently waive all existing and probable technical defaults under the 2004 Credit Facility as long as the Company submits its year-end 2004 financial statements and interim financial statements for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2005 by September 30, 2005. These conditions relate primarily to submissions of various financial statements and other financial and borrowing base related information.       The Waiver Amendment also modified certain of the ongoing financial covenants under the 2004 Credit Facility and established a requirement that the Company maintain a minimum cash balance of $15,000. Until such time as the waiver becomes permanent, the Company has certain additional reporting requirements, including periodic cash balance reporting. In addition, the Waiver Amendment prohibits the Company from borrowing cash under the 2004 Credit Facility until the waiver becomes permanent.  Since the Company was not able to submit the referenced statements by September 30, 2005, the waiver did not become permanent.       Additionally, the Company was not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants under the 2004 Credit Facility at September 30, 2005 and the Company has not obtained a waiver. The Company also believes it will not be in compliance with certain of the financial covenants under the 2004 Credit Facility at December 31, 2005. As a result of the covenant violations and the failure to provide certain financial statements by September 30, 2005, the bank syndicate has the right to discontinue advances under the facility as well as the issuance of new letters of credit. The inability of the Company to access new letters of credit could negatively impact the Company's ability to take on new work or bid additional work where letters of credit are required in order to bid on a project. Additionally, the bank syndicate could request that the Company provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit.       As the Company has done in the past, management believes that it will be able to negotiate a waiver with the syndicated bank group with respect to these violations. In the event the waivers are not obtained, the Company would expect to arrange for alternative financing which could include the following components, individually or in combination: (1) establishing a credit facility with a new bank group, (2) raising equity capital, (3) selling certain assets or (4) issuing debt in either a public or private transaction.                                         51     CONVERTIBLE NOTES       On March 12, 2004, the Company completed a primary offering of $60,000 of 2.75 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the "Convertible Notes"). On April 13, 2004, the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes exercised their option to purchase an additional $10,000 aggregate principal amount of the notes. Collectively, the primary offering and purchase option of the Convertible Notes total $70,000. The Convertible Notes are general senior unsecured obligations. Interest is paid semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, and payments began on September 15, 2004. The Convertible Notes mature on March 15, 2024 unless the notes are repurchased, redeemed or converted earlier. The Company may redeem the Convertible Notes for cash on or after March 15, 2011, at 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. The holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase the Convertible Notes, including unpaid interest, on March 15, 2011, 2014, and 2019 or upon a change of control related event. On March 15, 2011, or upon a change in control event, the Company must pay the purchase price in cash. On March 15, 2014 and 2019, the Company has the option of providing its common stock in lieu of cash or a combination of common stock and cash to fund purchases. The holders of the Convertible Notes may under certain circumstances, convert the notes into shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion ratio of 51.3611 shares of common stock per $1,000.00 principal amount of notes (representing a conversion price of approximately $19.47 per share resulting in 3,595,277 shares at December 31, 2004). The notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain specified events including, but not limited to, if, at certain times, the closing sale price of the Company's common stock exceeds 120 percent of the then current conversion price, or $23.36 per share based on the initial conversion price. Unamortized debt issue costs of $2,908, associated with the Convertible Notes are included in other assets at December 31, 2004 and are being amortized over the seven-year period ending March 2011. In the event of a default under any Company credit agreement other than the indenture covering the Convertible Notes, (1) in which the Company fails to pay principal or interest on indebtedness with an aggregate principal balance of $10,000 or more; or (2) in which indebtedness with a principal balance of $10,000 or more is accelerated, an event of default would result under the Convertible Notes. Since the non-compliance issues under the 2004 Credit Facility discussed above did not involve payment defaults and did not result in the acceleration of any indebtedness of the Company, these defaults did not create an event of default under the Convertible Notes.       On June 10, 2005, the Company received a letter from a law firm representing an investor claiming to be the owner of in excess of 25% of the Convertible Notes asserting that, as a result of the Company's failure to timely file with the SEC its 2004 Form 10-K and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, it was placing the Company on notice of an event of default under the indenture dated as of March 12, 2004 between the Company as issuer, and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture"), which governs the Convertible Notes. The Company indicated that it does not believe that it has failed to perform its obligations under the relevant provisions of the Indenture referenced in the letter. On August 19, 2005, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the beneficial owner of the Convertible Notes on behalf of whom the notice of default was sent, pursuant to which the Company agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the requisite vote to approve an amendment to the Indenture (the "Indenture Amendment"). The Company has obtained the requisite vote and on September 22, 2005, the Indenture Amendment became effective.       The Indenture Amendment extends the initial date on or after which the Convertible Notes may be redeemed by the Company to March 15, 2013 from March 15, 2011. In addition, a new provision was added to the Indenture which requires the Company, in the event of a "fundamental change" which is a change of                                          52    control event, in which 10% or more of the consideration in the transaction consists of "cash", to make a "coupon make-whole payment" equal to the present value (discounted at the U.S. treasury rate) of the lesser of (a) two years of scheduled payments of interest on the Convertible Notes or (b) all scheduled interest on the Convertible Notes from the date of the transaction through March 15, 2013.  LIQUIDITY       We believe that cash flows from operations, future borrowing capacity under the 2004 Credit Facility and the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes offering will be sufficient to finance working capital and capital expenditures for ongoing operations at our present level of activity. Capital expenditures for equipment in 2005 are estimated at $42,400. We believe that while there are numerous factors that could and will have an impact on our cash flow, both positively and negatively, the vast majority of which, should they occur, could be funded from our operations, existing cash balances, or future borrowing capacity. However, should the DOJ, SEC, or OFAC, as a result of their investigations, levy material civil and/or criminal fines or penalties against the Company, these fines could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and operations. For a list of events which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and a discussion of risk factors that could impact cash flow, please refer to the section entitled "Risk Factors" contained in Items 1 and 2 in this Form 10-K.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS                                                               Payments Due By Period                                           -------------------------------------------------------                                                     Less than                           More than                                            Total      1 year    1-3 years   4-5 years    5 years                                           -------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------                                                        (Dollar amounts in thousands)            Convertible Notes......................   $70,000     $   --      $   --      $   --     $70,000 Capital Lease Obligations .............     3,695      1,258       2,400          37          -- Operating Lease Obligations ...........     9,645      2,864       3,962       1,693       1,126 Other Long-term Liabilities ...........        55         41          14          --          --                                           -------     ------      ------      ------     ------- Total..................................   $83,395     $4,163      $6,376      $1,730     $71,126                                           =======     ======      ======      ======     =======        As of December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the 2004 Credit Facility and there were $60,163 in outstanding letters of credit. Letters of credit reduce availability on the facility by 75 percent of their amount outstanding; however, the total value of letters of credit outstanding may not exceed $150,000.       On July 19, 2005, the Company entered into a Second Amendment and Waiver Agreement ("Waiver Amendment") of the 2004 Credit Facility with the syndicated bank group to obtain continuing waivers regarding its non-compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants in the 2004 Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Waiver Amendment, the total credit availability under the $150,000 2004 Credit Facility is reduced to $100,000 as of the effective date of the Waiver Amendment. If we used all remaining availability to issue letters of credit, we had an additional $83,869 available for issuance of letters of credit at December 31, 2004. Cash borrowings under the line are limited to the lesser of 40 percent of the borrowing base or $30,000.       The Company was not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants under the 2004 Credit Facility at September 30, 2005 and the Company has not obtained a waiver. The Company also believes it will not be in compliance with certain of the financial covenants under the 2004 Credit Facility at December 31, 2005. As a result of the covenant violations and the failure to provide certain financial statements by September 30, 2005, the bank syndicate has the right to discontinue advances under the facility as well as the issuance of new letters of credit. The inability of the Company to access new letters of credit could negatively impact the Company's ability to take on new work or bid additional work where letters of credit are required in order to bid on a project. Additionally, the bank syndicate could request that the Company provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit.       Capital lease obligations include approximately $3,259 to a leasing company under a four-year capital lease in connection with the ongoing acquisition and installation of new corporate information systems and infrastructure.       We have certain operating leases for equipment, office and camp facilities. Minimum lease commitments under operating leases as of December 31, 2004, totaled $9,645 and are payable as follows: 2005, $2,864; 2006, $2,357; 2007, $1,605; 2008, $1,481; 2009, $212 and later years, $1,126.       Additionally, we have various notes and leases payable, generally related to equipment financing and local revolving credit facilities. All notes and leases are at market interest rates, and are collateralized by certain vehicles, equipment and/or real estate.       We have unsecured credit facilities with banks in certain countries outside the United States. Borrowings under these lines, in the form of short-term notes and overdrafts, are made at competitive local interest rates. Generally, each line is available only for borrowings related to operations in a specific country. Credit available under these facilities is approximately $4,240 at December 31, 2004. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2004 or 2003.                                          53         During 2004 we have increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from $917 to $7,598. This increase in the allowance is reflective of the $33,881 increase in accounts receivable and contract costs and recognized income not yet billed primarily in developing countries. However, we do not anticipate any significant collection problems with our customers beyond what has been already recognized in our allowance, including those in countries that may be experiencing economic and/or currency difficulties. Since our customers generally are major oil companies and government entities, and the terms for billing and collecting for work performed are generally established by contracts, we historically have had a very low incidence of collectability problems.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS       From time to time we enter into commercial commitments, usually in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit, insurance bonds and financial guarantees. Contracts with our customers may require us to provide letters of credit or insurance bonds with regard to our performance of contracted services. In such cases, the commitments can be called upon in the event of our failure to perform contracted services. Likewise, contracts may allow us to issue letters of credit or insurance bonds in lieu of contract retention provisions, in which the client withholds a percentage of the contract value until project completion or expiration of a warranty period.       In connection with our 10 percent interest in a joint venture in Venezuela, we issued a corporate guarantee equal to 10 percent of the joint venture's outstanding borrowings with two banks. The guarantee reduces as borrowings are repaid. The commitment as of December 31, 2004 totals $3,453, the maximum amount of future payments we could be required to make.       A summary of our off-balance sheet commercial commitments as of December 31, 2004 is as follows:            Amount of Commitment                                                                 Expiration Per Period                                                       ----------------------------------                                                          Total     Less Than   More Than                                                       Commitment    2 Years     2 Years                                                       ----------   ---------   ---------                                                          (Dollar amounts in thousands)        Letters of Credit:    Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project - performance ...    $  6,410     $ 6,410     $    --    Nigeria Projects - performance .................      36,941      17,182      19,759    Other - performance and retention ..............      16,812      16,812          --                                                        --------     -------     -------    Total Letters of Credit ........................      60,163      40,404      19,759 Expiring Insurance Bonds - primarily performance ..      47,310      47,310          -- Corporate Guarantee ...............................       3,453       3,453          --                                                        --------     -------     ------- Total Commercial Commitments ......................    $110,926     $91,167     $19,759                                                        ========     =======     =======        These commercial commitments totaling $110,926 represent the maximum amount of future payments we could be required to make. We had no liability recorded as of December 31, 2004, related to these commitments.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, "Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets," which amends APB Opinion No. 29. The guidance in APB 29, Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions, is based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The amendment made by SFAS 153 eliminates the exception for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The provisions of the statement are effective for exchanges taking place in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We will adopt the standard as of the effective date and we believe it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.       In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, "Share-Based Payment." This standard requires expensing of stock options and other share-based payments and supersedes SFAS 123, which had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing pro forma disclosure only. This standard is effective for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2006 and will apply to all awards granted, modified,                                          54    cancelled or repurchased after that date as well as the unvested portion of prior awards. We will adopt the standard as of January 1, 2006. We are currently evaluating the total effect on the consolidated financial statements and the method to use when valuing stock options.       In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs," an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement clarifies the types of costs that should be expensed rather than capitalized as inventory. This statement also clarifies the circumstances under which fixed overhead costs associated with operating facilities involved in inventory processing should be capitalized. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, and may impact certain inventory costs we incur after January 1, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.       In October 2004, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the "Emerging Issues Task Force in EITF Issue No. 04-8 ("EITF 04-8") "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share," which changes the treatment of contingently convertible debt instruments in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. EITF 04-8 provides that shares issuable upon conversion of these debt instruments be included in the earnings per share computation, if dilutive, regardless of whether any contingent conditions, in such instruments have been met. EITF 04-8 is for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004, and requires restatement of previously reported earnings per share. We adopted EITF 04-8 as of December 31, 2004. See Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our income (loss) per share calculation.       In December 2003, the FASB reissued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 ("FIN 46") and its amendment entitled FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46R") which were first issued by the FASB in January 2003. FIN 46R requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if (a) the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or (b) do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES       Our operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation, government mandates or other economic factors, in the countries in which we operate. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain of our major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work.                                          55    ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Our primary market risk is our exposure to changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates. We attempt to negotiate contracts which provide for payment in U.S. dollars, but we may be required to take all or a portion of payment under a contract in another currency. To mitigate non-U.S. currency exchange risk, we seek to match anticipated non-U.S. currency revenue with expense in the same currency whenever possible. To the extent we are unable to match non-U.S. currency revenue with expense in the same currency, we may use forward contracts, options or other common hedging techniques in the same non-U.S. currencies. We had no forward contracts or options at December 31, 2004 and 2003.       The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value at December 31, 2004 due to the generally short maturities of these items. At December 31, 2004, we invested primarily in short-term dollar denominated bank deposits. We have the ability and expect to hold our investments to maturity.       Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our borrowings under the 2004 Credit Facility. At December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings subject to variable interest rates. At December 31, 2004, our fixed rate debt approximated fair value based upon discounted future cash flows using current market rates.                                          56    ITEM 8.
