ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS           The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  GENERAL       We derive our revenue from providing construction, engineering and specialty services to the oil, gas and power industries and government entities worldwide. We obtain contracts for our work primarily by competitive bidding or through negotiations with long-standing or prospective clients. Bidding activity, backlog and revenue resulting from the award of contracts to us may vary significantly from period to period. Contracts have durations from a few weeks to several months or in some cases more than a year.       Operations outside the United States may be subject to certain risks which ordinarily would not exist in the United States, including foreign currency restrictions, extreme exchange rate fluctuations, expropriation of assets, civil uprising and riots, availability of personnel and government audit. However, we have successfully operated in Nigeria for the past 40 years with very favorable relationships with the local communities, and believe that we can continue to operate in the area. We have been active in South America since 1939. Venezuela is the largest oil producer in South America and has redirected its energy initiative to include development of its significant natural gas reserves. This new initiative should translate into more demand for our natural gas pipeline capabilities. However, the Venezuelan economy can be highly inflationary and the government of Venezuela, under Presidente Hugo Chavez, has experiended extreme civil unrest culminating in a national labor strike beginning in December, 2002. We suspended all work in Venezuela in December 2002. We resumed work in February 2003 when the impact of the strike had moderated although business and commercial activity had not yet returned to pre-strike levels.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Revenue Recognition: Percentage-of-Completion Method - A number of factors relating to our business affect the recognition of contract revenue. Revenue from fixed-price construction and engineering contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs, taking into consideration physical completion. Total estimated costs, and thus contract income, are impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, and the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation and politics, may affect the progress of a project's completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition. Generally, we do not recognize income on a fixed-price contract until the contract is approximately 5% to 10% complete, depending upon the nature of the contract. Costs which are considered to be reimbursable are excluded from the percentage-of-completion calculation. Accrued revenue pertaining to reimbursables is limited to the cost of the reimbursables. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined. Revenue from change orders, extra work and variations in the scope of work is recognized when agreement is reached with clients as to both the scope of work and price. Revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with clients as to the value of the claims, which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Revenue from unit-price contracts is recognized as earned. We believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a relatively long time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work and cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized.       All U.S. government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the client. In the event a contract would be terminated at the convenience of the client prior to completion, we will typically be compensated for progress up to the time of termination and any termination costs. In addition, many contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements with liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances that are within our control.       An example of a project involving many of the above factors is our project in Australia. The project in Australia was completed after July 1, 2000, the date on which liquidated damages were scheduled to commence under the contract. Due primarily to productivity and other labor issues, and anticipated liquidated damages, we recognized a contract loss of $14.5 million in 2000. However, during 2001, the                                           31   client accepted claims for extension of the scheduled completion date, accepted other claims and requested additional services, resulting in contract amendments and the realization in 2001 of $4.2 million of contract income on the project.       Income Taxes - The determination of our tax provision is complex due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the United States which may be subject to certain risks which ordinarily would not be expected in the United States. Tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes which may be applied on a retroactive basis. If this were to occur, our tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported. Furthermore, in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, we estimate taxable income into the future and determine the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Future taxable income could be materially different than amounts estimated, in which case the valuation allowance would need to be adjusted.       Joint Venture Accounting - From time to time, we seek one or more joint venture partners when a project requires local content, equipment, manpower or other resources beyond those we have available to complete work in a timely and efficient manner or when we wish to share risk on a particularly large project. We have investments, ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent, in joint ventures that operate in similar lines of business as ours. Investments consist of a 10 percent interest in a consortium for work in Venezuela, a 35 percent interest in a joint venture for work in Australia and a 50 percent interest in a joint venture for work in Africa. Interests in these unconsolidated ventures are accounted for under the equity-method in the consolidated balance sheets and on a proportionate consolidation basis in the consolidated statements of operations. This presentation is consistent with construction industry practice. Alternatively, if we were to account for these interests using the equity-method in the consolidated statement of operations, revenue and contract cost would be materially lower; however, net income would not change.  SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS       On January 24, 2000, we acquired Rogers & Phillips, Inc., a closely held pipeline construction company in Houston, Texas with an experienced management team and a strong market position in the U.S. Gulf Coast area. Founded in 1992, RPI provides a full range of construction services for pipeline operating companies, including station and piping projects in congested urban areas and inside plants, as well as cross-country pipelines. The consideration included 1,035,000 shares of our common stock and approximately $1.7 million in cash and acquisition costs. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase.       In September 2000, through a joint venture led by a subsidiary of ours, we were awarded a significant project, the scope of which includes the engineering, procurement and construction of a 665-mile (1,070-kilometer), 30-inch crude oil pipeline from the Doba Fields in Chad to an export terminal on the coast of Cameroon in Africa. Engineering and procurement activities began in late 2000. Pipeline construction began in November 2001 and is expected to be completed in 2003.       During 2000, our activities in Nigeria included work on two major EPC contracts for Shell: (a) the Nembe Creek gas gathering pipeline system, and (b) four concrete barge-mounted gas compressor facilities for Shell's Nembe Creek Associated Gas project (collectively, the "Nembe Creek Projects"). At the end of 2001, both projects were nearing completion.       During 2000, Willbros USA, Inc. relocated its administrative headquarters and some construction support services from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Houston, Texas. The cost of the move, termination benefits, and office lease termination costs totaled approximately $4.5 million.       On October 12, 2001, we completed the purchase of MSI Energy Services Inc., a Canadian general contractor whose common shares were listed on The Canadian Venture Exchange. MSI provides pipeline construction, pipeline integrity and maintenance services in addition to pipe storage and handling services, specialty metal fabrication services, pipeline equipment rentals and concrete construction products in the oil sands region of Northern Alberta, Canada. The aggregate purchase price, including transaction costs, was $8.3 million. In conjunction with the acquisition the Company sold 144,175 common shares from treasury for $1.9 million to certain MSI shareholders and the net cash paid of $6.4 million to purchase MSI was funded through borrowings under our principal credit agreement. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase.       During 2001, our engineering group executed an alliance agreement with Explorer Pipeline Company to provide project management, engineering, procurement and construction services for their Mainline                                           32   Expansion Project in Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana (the "Explorer Pipeline Project"). This project includes construction of 12 grassroots pump stations, modifications at 13 existing pump stations, the addition of 500,000 barrels of storage at the Wood River, Illinois terminal and modifications at two other terminals. The project is scheduled for completion in 2003.       On May 14, 2002, we completed a public offering of our common shares at $17.75 per share; 4,356,750 shares were sold by us. The underwriters exercised options to purchase all shares available for over-allotments. We received $71.9 million in proceeds, after the underwriting discount and offering costs, which were used to repay indebtedness under the prior credit agreement and for working capital and general corporate purposes.       In June 2002, we completed a new $125.0 million credit agreement with a syndicated bank group, replacing the existing facility that was due to expire in February 2003. The new facility has terms similar to the prior facility, and will expire in June 2005.       On October 23, 2002, we completed the acquisition of Mt. West Fabrication Plants and Stations, Inc., Process Electric and Control, Inc., Process Engineering Design, Inc. and Pacific Industrial Electric, Inc. (collectively, "Mt. West Group"). Mt. West Group provides design-build services, including engineering, procurement and construction services to the energy industry, primarily in the western United States. The purchase price of $13.7 million consisted of $4.6 million cash and acquisition costs and 950,000 shares of common stock valued at $9.1 million. In addition, the purchase price will be adjusted by an earn-out amount equal to 25 percent of the combined net income of Mt. West Group for the 24-month period following the date of acquisition. Any earn-out amounts due shall be payable in cash upon completion of the earn-out period. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase.  OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES       We use EBITDA (earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) as part of our overall assessment of financial performance by comparing EBITDA between accounting periods. We believe that EBITDA is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in businesses similar to ours. EBITDA for the year 2002 was $60.1 million, up $8.5 million from $51.6 million for 2001.       We define anticipated contract revenue as backlog when the award of a contract is reasonably assured, generally upon the execution of a definitive agreement or contract. Anticipated revenue from post-contract award processes, including change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work and the effect of escalation or currency fluctuation formulas, is not added to backlog until realization is reasonably assured. New contract awards totaled $392.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. Additions to backlog during the year were as follows: construction, $269.5 million; engineering, $46.2 million; and specialty services, $76.4 million. Backlog decreases by type of service as a result of services performed during the period were as follows: construction, $344.8 million; engineering, $177.2 million; and specialty services, $61.7 million. Backlog at the end of 2002 decreased $191.6 million (47%) from the previous year end to $216.0 million and consisted of the following: (a) construction, $132.4 million, down $75.3 million (36%); (b) engineering, $23.7 million, down $131.0 million (85%); and (c) specialty services, $59.9 million, up $14.7 million (33%). Construction backlog consists primarily of the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project and construction projects in Offshore West Africa. Engineering backlog consists primarily of the Explorer Pipeline Project and other engineering and procurement projects in the United States. Specialty services backlog is largely attributable to a 16-year water injection contract awarded in 1998 to a consortium in which we have a 10 percent interest in Venezuela, contracts to build, own and operate four fueling facilities for the United States government, and service contracts in Oman and Canada.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Our contract revenue and contract costs are primarily related to the timing and location of development projects in the oil, gas and power industries worldwide. Contract revenue and cost variations by country from year to year are the result of (a) entering and exiting work countries; (b) the execution of new contract awards; (c) the completion of contracts; and (d) the overall level of activity in our services.       Our ability to be successful in obtaining and executing contracts can be affected by the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar compared to the currencies of our competitors, our clients and our work locations. During 2002, as a result of economic and political events in Venezuela, the Venezuelan Bolivar                                          33   experienced significant devaluation relative to the U.S. Dollar. Included in foreign exchange loss in 2002 is a $0.9 million loss resulting from the translation of our Venezuelan Bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollars. We do not believe that our revenue or results of operations in other areas were adversely affected in this regard during the years ended December 31, 2002 or 2001.            FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR                              ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001  CONTRACT REVENUE       Contract revenue increased $193.6 million (50%) to $583.7 million due to (a) $130.4 million (60%) of increased construction revenue due primarily to construction on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project, work on a project in Bolivia and increased activity in Offshore West Africa, net of reduced activities on the Nembe Creek Projects in Nigeria as they neared completion and reduced construction activity in the United States; (b) increased engineering revenue of $56.9 million (47%) due to an increase of engineering and procurement services in the United States primarily related to the Explorer Pipeline Project; and (c) an increase of $6.3 million (11%) in specialty services revenue principally from revenue generated by MSI in Canada, which was acquired in October 2001, offset by reduced activity in Venezuela. Revenue in the United States increased $26.3 million (13%) due primarily to an increase in engineering and procurement services and the acquisition of Mt. West Group in October 2002, offset by a decrease in construction activity. Chad-Cameroon revenue increased $101.3 million resulting from construction work begun in the fourth quarter of 2001 on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project. Revenue from Offshore West Africa increased $15.3 million as a result of increased vessel utilization on several projects during the first six months of 2002. Work that began in 2002 on a project in Bolivia resulted in $47.4 million in revenue in that country. A project in the Dominican Republic during 2002 produced $17.7 million in revenue, and revenue in Canada increased $10.4 million resulting from the acquisition of MSI in October 2001. Nigeria revenue decreased $19.5 million (29%) due primarily to reduced activity on the Nembe Creek Projects. The combined revenue in all other areas decreased $5.3 million (15%).  CONTRACT COSTS       Contract costs increased $171.1 million (54%) to $488.3 million due to an increase of $107.7 million (62%) in construction services cost, $54.9 million (56%) in engineering services cost and $8.5 million (19%) in specialty services cost. Variations in contract cost by country were closely related to the variations in contract revenue.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION       Depreciation and amortization increased $3.8 million (19%) due primarily to the addition of equipment for the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project and the project in Bolivia.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE       General and administrative expense increased $3.9 million (13%) to $33.9 million. This increase is due to higher staff compensation and administrative services necessary to support the 50% increase in revenue. As a percent of revenue, general and administrative expense decreased from 7.7% in 2001 to 5.8% in 2002.  OPERATING INCOME       Operating income increased $5.6 million (17%) from $32.7 million in 2001 to $38.3 million in 2002. Excluding a gain of $9.2 million in 2001 associated with the termination of benefit plans, operating income increased $14.8 million (63%). Excluding the gain in 2001, operating income increased largely as a result of higher revenue resulting from greater activity in North America, construction activity on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project and marine maintenance and construction in Offshore West Africa, partially offset by reduced income in Nigeria resulting from a 29% decrease in revenue in that area. The increased income from this 50% increase in revenue was offset by higher depreciation, amortization and general and administrative costs.                                            34  NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)       Net interest expense decreased $1.0 million (40%) to $1.6 million expense. In May 2002 we completed a common stock offering in which we received $71.9 million in net proceeds. Borrowings under our prior credit agreement were paid in full. Interest expense in 2002 includes amortization of debt issue costs of $0.9 million compared to $0.5 million in 2001.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSS       Foreign exchange loss increased $0.9 million to $1.0 million due primarily to the effect of the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar in 2002 on our Venezuelan Bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES       The provision for income taxes decreased $4.9 million (47%) due primarily to the difference between $6.6 million of changes to estimated income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets during 2002 compared to $3.2 million of similar changes during 2001. In addition, during 2002, we recorded a $1.1 million deferred income tax benefit associated with operating losses outside the United States. Changes to the 2002 income tax liabilities include a $1.2 million reduction due to annual settlements of income tax liabilities outside the United States and a $1.0 million reduction resulting from changes in current year estimated tax liabilities outside the United States as a result of the above settlements. In addition, we reduced income taxes in the United States by $1.1 million as a result of the refinement of the allocation of expenses among operating entities and other items affecting estimated tax liabilities in the United States and a $3.3 million reduction in the deferred tax assets valuation allowance. We reduced our U.S. valuation allowance as a result of our assessment of our United States operations including past earnings history and projected future earnings considering the scheduled expiration of our tax net operating losses. Changes in 2001 resulted from a $2.3 million reduction in the deferred assets valuation allowance in the United States and a $0.9 million reduction from annual settlements income taxes outside the United States. The provision for income taxes is also impacted by the differing income tax rates in the various countries in which we operate, including for example Nigeria where income taxes are largely based on deemed profit rather than taxable income as well as a tax holiday in Cameroon for income earned on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project.            FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR                              ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000  CONTRACT REVENUE       Contract revenue increased $75.8 million (24%) to $390.1 million as a result of (a) increased engineering revenue of $61.6 million due to an increase in engineering and procurement services in the United States; and (b) increased construction revenue of $22.1 million due primarily to increased construction activity in the United States, Offshore West Africa and Cameroon partially offset by reduced activities on the Nembe Creek Projects in Nigeria as they neared completion in 2001 and the completion in the third quarter of 2000 of the construction contract in Australia. These increases in engineering and construction revenue were partially offset by a decrease of $7.9 million in specialty services revenue. Revenue in the United States increased $112.3 million (121%) due to an increase in engineering, procurement and construction services. Cameroon revenue increased $34.0 million as work on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project moved from the engineering, procurement and mobilization phases into the construction phase in November 2001. Offshore West Africa revenue increased $26.3 million (149%) due to higher utilization of the combination barge "Willbros 318" as well as utilization of the derrick barge "WB82" acquired in 2001. Revenue in Oman increased $1.4 million (11%). Canada revenue, from the MSI acquisition on October 12, 2001, was $3.3 million. Nigeria revenue decreased $75.6 million (53%) due to reduced activity on the Nembe Creek Projects. Australia revenue decreased $16.7 million (81%) due to the construction contract that was completed in 2000, net of $4.0 million from contract amendments and settled claims during 2001. Revenue in Venezuela decreased $9.2 million (35%).  CONTRACT COSTS       Contract costs increased $47.8 million (18%) to $317.2 million due to an increase of $51.9 million in engineering services cost and an increase in construction services cost of $7.2 million, partially offset by a decrease of $11.3 million in specialty services cost. Variations in contract cost by country were closely related to the variations in contract revenue, with the exception of Australia. Contract costs in Australia                                           35   decreased by $35.4 million or $18.7 million more than the decrease in revenue primarily as a result of a $14.5 million loss recognized during 2000, offset by $4.2 million of settled claims in 2001.  TERMINATION OF BENEFIT PLANS       During 2001 we terminated two employee benefit plans which resulted in non-taxable gains of $9.2 million. These plans were costly to maintain and had become ineffective in the recruitment and retention of an experienced and qualified workforce.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION       Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.9 million to $19.5 million due primarily to the sale in 2000 of excess equipment in Venezuela, Indonesia, the United States and Oman, accelerated amortization of excess spare parts in Indonesia in 2000 and accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements of $0.8 million related to termination of our administrative office space in Tulsa, Oklahoma as a result of relocation of those offices to Houston, Texas.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE       General and administrative expense, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 7.7% in 2001 from 9.6% in 2000. On a dollar basis, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million to $30.0 million in 2001. This reduction is the result of the non-recurrence of the $3.6 million in expenses that were incurred in 2000 that were associated with the relocation of the administrative office to Houston, Texas. This reduction was offset by increased general and administrative expenses in 2001 as expansion in staffing and support services were necessary to support the 24% increase in revenue during the year.  OPERATING INCOME       Operating income increased $40.5 million from an operating loss of $7.8 million in 2000 to operating income of $32.7 million in 2001. For the reasons described above, operating income increased in Australia by $19.4 million (from an operating loss of $15.4 million in 2000), the United States by $14.8 million, Offshore West Africa by $9.2 million and Cameroon by $5.0 million. Additionally, we recognized $9.2 million of gains related to the termination of certain employee benefit plans. These improvements were offset by reduced operating income in Nigeria and Venezuela totaling $18.7 million. All other areas combined accounted for an increase of $1.6 million.  NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)       Net interest income (expense) decreased $0.7 million to $2.6 million net interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates during the period offset by higher average debt levels.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSS        Foreign exchange loss decreased $1.0 million to $0.1 million primarily due to the write-off during 2000 of cumulative translation adjustments associated with substantially reduced operations in certain work countries.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)       Other income decreased $0.9 million to a $0.4 million expense primarily due to gains on disposals of equipment in 2000 compared to losses on disposals of equipment in 2001.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES       The provision for income taxes increased $5.1 million while pretax income increased $39.8 million. This is the result of increased taxes on higher taxable income in the United States offset by lower income taxes in Nigeria due to a decrease in taxable revenue in that country, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance in the United States by $2.3 million and settlement of $0.9 million of prior year                                           36   taxes in Nigeria. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was reduced in each of 2000 and 2001 as a result of significant increases in revenue, earnings, contract awards, backlog and forecasted earnings for some of our U.S. entities. In addition, we had $9.2 million of non-taxable gains in 2001 associated with the termination of benefit plans. The provision for income taxes is impacted by income taxes in certain countries, primarily Nigeria, being based on deemed profit rather than taxable income and the fact that losses in one country cannot be used to offset taxable income in another country.  EFFECT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES       Our operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation, government mandates or other economic factors, in the countries in which we operate. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain of our major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Our primary requirements for capital are to acquire, upgrade and maintain equipment, provide working capital for current projects, finance the mobilization of employees and equipment to new projects, establish a presence in countries where we perceive growth opportunities and finance the possible acquisition of new businesses and equity investments. Historically, we have met these capital requirements primarily from operating cash flows, and more recently from borrowings under our credit facility.       Cash and cash equivalents increased $30.2 million (156%) to $49.5 million at December 31, 2002, from $19.3 million at December 31, 2001. The increase was due to cash flows of $28.9 million from operations and $33.1 million from financing activities resulting from net proceeds from sale of our common stock of $75.2 million, reduced by net repayments of debt of $42.1 million. These increases were offset by $31.6 million of investing activities primarily for the purchase of $30.2 million of equipment and spare parts and $2.0 million for the acquisition of Mt. West Group (net of cash acquired), and $0.2 million from the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. Working capital increased $44.9 million during 2002 to $90.9 million at December 31, 2002. Stockholders' equity increased $114.2 million to $210.8 million at December 31, 2002.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS       On June 14, 2002, we completed a new $125.0 million credit agreement with a syndicated bank group, replacing the existing facility that was due to expire in February 2003. The facility may be used for standby and commercial letters of credit, borrowings or a combination thereof. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of 40% of the borrowing base or $50.0 million and are payable at termination on June 14, 2005. Interest is payable quarterly at a Base Rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.00% or a Eurodollar Rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 3.00%. A commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit agreement is payable quarterly ranging from 0.50% to 0.75%. The credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our assets, including stock of our principal subsidiaries, restricts the payment of cash dividends and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. The borrowing base is calculated using varying percentages of cash, accounts receivable, accrued revenue, contract cost and recognized income not yet billed, property, plant and equipment, and spare parts. Debt issue costs of $3.0 million net of accumulated amortization of $0.9 million, associated with the new credit agreement are included in other assets at December 31, 2002 and are being amortized over 24 months.       As of December 31, 2002, there were no amounts borrowed under the credit agreement. We had $52.8 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $72.2 million available for letters of credit or $44.0 million for borrowings or a combination thereof.       We have various other obligations totalling $1.2 million, including notes payable, generally related to equipment and insurance financing, and local revolving credit facilities. All are at market rates, are collateralized by certain vehicles, equipment and/or real estate, and mature in 2003.       In addition we have unsecured credit facilities with banks in certain countries outside the United States. Borrowings under these lines, in the form of short-term notes and overdrafts, are made at competitive local interest rates. Generally, each line is available only for borrowings related to operations in a specific country. Credit available under these facilities is approximately $6.3 million at December 31, 2002. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2002.                                           37        We have certain operating leases for office and camp facilities. Minimum lease commitments under operating leases as of December 31, 2002, totaled $4.7 million and are payable as follows: 2003, $1.3 million; 2004, $1.1 million; 2005, $1.0 million; 2006, $0.6 million; 2007, $0.2 million and later years, $0.5 million.       Based upon the above, our total cash obligations are payable as follows: 2003, $2.5 million; 2004, $1.1 million and later years, $2.3 million.  COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS       From time to time we enter into commercial commitments, usually in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit, insurance bonds and financial guarantees. Contracts with our customers may require us to provide letters of credit or insurance bonds with regard to our performance of contracted services. In such cases, the commitments can be called upon in the event of our failure to perform contracted services. Likewise, contracts may allow us to issue letters of credit or insurance bonds in lieu of contract retention provisions, in which the client withholds a percentage of the contract value until project completion or expiration of a warranty period. Retention commitments can be called upon in the event of warranty or project completion issues, as prescribed in the contracts. In connection with the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project joint venture, we issued a letter of credit to an equipment leasing company equal to 50% of total lease payments, our share of the joint venture. The letter of credit reduces as lease payments are made and expires in June 2003. The commitment can be called upon as a result of failure to make lease payments.       In connection with our 10% interest in a joint venture in Venezuela, we issued a corporate guarantee equal to 10% of the joint venture's outstanding borrowings with two banks. The guarantee reduces as borrowings are repaid, and expires in March 2004. The commitment as of December 31, 2002 totals $3.3 million, the maximum amount of future payments we could be required to make.       In 1997 we entered into lease agreements with a special-purpose leasing partnership for land and an office building for our engineering group in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In July 2002, we acquired the assets for $5.5 million, thereby eliminating the lease agreements and related commercial commitments.       A summary of our off-balance sheet commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002 is as follows:                                                                                     AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT                                                                                  EXPIRATION PER PERIOD                                                                               ---------------------------                                                                    TOTAL       LESS THAN       OVER 2                                                                 COMMITMENT      2 YEARS         YEARS                                                                ------------   ------------   ------------                                                                       (Dollar Amounts in Millions)        Letters of Credit:     Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project - performance               $       28.3   $       28.3   $         --     Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project - equipment lease                    7.1            7.1             --     Bolivia Project - performance                                       8.9            8.9             --     Other - performance and retention                                   8.5            8.5             --                                                                ------------   ------------   ------------     Total letters of credit                                            52.8           52.8             --                                                                ------------   ------------   ------------  Insurance Bonds - primarily performance related:     Expiring                                                            6.2            5.8            0.4     Non-expiring                                                         --             --             --                                                                ------------   ------------   ------------     Total insurance bonds                                               6.2            5.8            0.4                                                                ------------   ------------   ------------  Corporate guarantee                                                     3.3            3.3             --                                                                ------------   ------------   ------------ Total commercial commitments                                   $       62.3   $       61.9   $        0.4                                                                ============   ============   ============        These commercial commitments totaling $62.3 million represent the maximum amount of future payments we could be required to make. We had no liability recorded as of December 31, 2002, related to these commitments.                                           38        In connection with our 50% interest in a joint venture related to the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project, we are joint and severally liable for the performance of our joint venturer. In the event our joint venturer were unable to fulfill their responsibilities associated with the project, we would be required to fulfill their duties. In doing so, we would recognize the income or losses, if any, associated with our fulfilling the duties of our joint venturer. At December 31, 2002, the project is approximately 80% complete and is estimated to produce contract income. However, there is no limitation to the maximum future potential payments we could be required to make in the event the project were to result in contract losses. We have no liability recorded as of December 31, 2002, related to this commitment.       We do not anticipate any significant collection problems with our customers, including those in countries that may be experiencing economic and/or currency difficulties. Since our customers generally are major oil companies and government entities, and the terms for billing and collecting for work performed are generally established by contracts, we historically have a very low incidence of collectability problems.       We believe that cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to finance working capital and capital expenditures for ongoing operations. We estimate capital expenditures for equipment and spare parts to be approximately $35.0 to $40.0 million in 2003. In analyzing our cash flow from operations, we believe that while there are numerous factors that could and will have an impact on our cash flow, both positively and negatively; there is not one or two events that should they occur could not be funded from our operations or borrowing capacity. For a list of events which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and a discussion of risk factors that could impact cash flow, please refer to the section entitled "Political and Economic Risks; Operational Risks" contained in Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K.       During 1998 and 1999, we repurchased and held in treasury 2,175,371 shares of Common Stock for $16.1 million. We did not repurchase any shares in 2000, 2001 or 2002. In January 2000, 1,035,000 shares of treasury stock were issued in connection with the acquisition of RPI. In October 2001, 144,175 shares of treasury stock were issued in connection with the acquisition of MSI. In October 2002, 950,000 shares of treasury stock were issued in connection with the acquisition of Mt. West Group. As of December 31, 2002, a total of 46,196 shares remain in treasury stock at an average price of $7.43 per share.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method. We will adopt SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003. The transition adjustment, if any, will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. At this time, we do not anticipate that the effect of the adoption of this statement will be material to either our financial position or results of operations.       In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of SFAS No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13 and Technical Corrections". SFAS No. 145 provides guidance for income statement classification of gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. We will adopt SFAS No. 145 in January 2003 and do not expect adoption to materially affect our consolidated financial statements.       In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities", which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs. SFAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 146 for restructuring activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under Issue 94-3, a liability for an exit cost is recognized at the date of the Company's commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. Accordingly, SFAS No. 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized.       In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. The Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to                                           39   recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002.       In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. Certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Our primary market risk is our exposure to changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates. We attempt to negotiate contracts which provide for payment in U.S. dollars, but we may be required to take all or a portion of payment under a contract in another currency. To mitigate non-U.S. currency exchange risk, we seek to match anticipated non-U.S. currency revenue with expenses in the same currency whenever possible. To the extent we are unable to match non-U.S. currency revenue with expenses in the same currency, we may use forward contracts, options or other common hedging techniques in the same non-U.S. currencies. We had no forward contracts or options at December 31, 2002 and 2001.       The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value at December 31, 2002 due to the generally short maturities of these items. We invest primarily in short-term dollar denominated bank deposits, and at December 31, 2002 did not have any investment in instruments with a maturity of more than a few days or in any equity securities. We have the ability and expect to hold our investments to maturity.       Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt. In May 2002, subsequent to completing our public offering of common shares, we paid all borrowings on our credit facility and as such at December 31, 2002, none of our indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates. At December 31, 2002, our fixed rate debt approximated fair value based upon discounted future cash flows using current market rates.                                           40     ITEM 8.
