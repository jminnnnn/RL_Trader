ITEM 7.      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  OVERVIEW       We derive our revenue from providing construction, engineering and specialty services to the oil, gas and power industries and government entities worldwide. In 2003 our revenue was primarily generated from operations in Canada, Chad, Cameroon, Iraq, Nigeria, Oman, United States, and Venezuela. We obtain contracts for our work primarily by competitive bidding or through negotiations with long-standing or prospective clients. Contracts have durations from a few weeks to several months or in some cases more than a year.       We believe the fundamentals supporting the demand for engineering and construction services for the oil, gas and power industries indicate the market for our services will be strong in the mid to long-term. We expect the markets outside of North America to lead the improvements in demand for our services. We expect the demand in North America for our services to improve in late 2004. An industry survey appears to substantiate our outlook as they are suggesting that planned worldwide pipeline construction will be higher in 2004 than in 2003. The survey indicates an increase in the planned miles of pipeline construction from approximately 38,000 miles in 2003 and beyond to approximately 59,000 miles in 2004 and beyond. Our bidding activity also substantiates our outlook for the near-term as we have seen an increase in prospects that we believe fit with our capabilities and qualifications from approximately $2 billion at the end of 2002 to approximately $5 billion at December 2003.       For the year ended December 31, 2003, we had a loss of $3.2 million or $0.16 per share on revenue of $418.7 million. This compares to revenue of $583.7 million in 2002, a Willbros record, when we reported net income of $29.7 million or $1.59 per diluted share. The operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 were positively impacted by the resolution of a portion of our contract variations. This resolution positively impacted revenue, contract income, net income, and EBITDA by $6.9 million. The timing and amount of potential future resolution of the remaining claims for contract variations of over $30 million is uncertain.       Our 2003 revenue was down from 2002, primarily driven by weak market conditions in North America, which resulted in an 80% decline in the engineering group revenue. The weakness in the North American market is attributable to the following:       -    Contraction in the amount of credit available to our traditional           customers,       -    Stagnant economic growth,       -    Transfer of pipeline assets by major pipeline transportation companies           to new "non-traditional" owners, which resulted in delays in expansion           plans of these existing pipeline systems,       -    Delays in capital expenditures as a result of concern related to           hostilities in the Middle East, and       -    Overbuilding of natural gas fired generation capacity.       Outside North America we experienced intermittent political and social unrest in Iraq, Nigeria and Venezuela which reduced our revenue and negatively impacted our contract margins for 2003. Revenue in 2003 was also lower due to the completion, in the first half of the year, of three major projects which were not replaced with projects of similar magnitude.       Contract margin for the year decreased to 12.7% of revenue from 16.4% in 2002. This decline in contract margin is the result of the following:       -    An overall decline in the contract margins in the United States due to           the competitiveness of the market for our services,       -    Persistent and heavy rain on a major project in the Southeastern           United States,       -    Negative impact of the contract costs without offsetting revenue           associated with unresolved contract variations,       -    Less revenue to cover our fixed and semi-variable indirect contract           costs, and       -    Delays in the performance of our work due to intermittent political           and social unrest in Iraq, Nigeria and Venezuela during the year.                                          33       General and Administrative ("G&A") expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due primarily to the lower 2003 revenue and a $2.2 million increase in G&A expenses in 2003 over 2002. The increase in G&A expenses is due in large part to the inclusion of the Mt. West Group of companies for the entire year in 2003 versus just the fourth quarter in 2002. This accounted for $3.3 million of additional G&A expenses in 2003. We also incurred increased G&A expenses in 2003 above 2002 levels due to a marked increase in bid activity, primarily in our international markets, increased insurance costs, and legal and consulting support costs on contract variation resolution.       The effective income tax rate for the year exceeded the United States statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of:       -    Income earned under contracts which provide tax concessions that           eliminate the payment of income taxes, and       -    Utilization of previously unrecognized net operating loss ("NOL")           carryforwards to offset current income tax expenses in countries           outside of the United States.       These benefits were partially offset by the requirement in certain countries outside of the United States to provide income taxes on a deemed profit which resulted in an effective tax rate which was substantially higher than the United States statutory income tax rate.       In 2003, our cash and cash equivalents decreased from $49.5 million to $21.0 million and our long-term debt increased from $0 to $17.0 million. These changes were primarily due to the following:       -    An investment of $40.6 million in capital assets. A significant amount           of the total capital expenditures was related to our gas processing           plant in Opal, Wyoming (the "Opal Gas Plant"). The Opal Gas Plant           began operations in the first quarter of 2004 under a ten-year gas           processing contract with a subsidiary of the Williams Companies (See           the related discussion under "Significant Business Developments"); and       -    $7.8 million used in operating activities primarily attributable to           increases in Nigeria's accounts receivable and contract cost and           recognized income not yet billed.       These cash outflows were partially funded by increased borrowings of $14.0 million under our line of credit and increased capital lease obligations of $4.3 million.       In the first quarter of 2004, we completed two financing transactions which we believe will improve our liquidity and, combined with cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for future operations. On March 12, 2004, we completed a $60.0 million 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the "Convertible Notes") offering. Also, on March 12, 2004, we amended and restated the $125.0 million senior secured credit facility. The three-year amended and restated credit facility (the "2004 Credit Facility") provides for $150.0 million of available credit capacity to be used for letters of credit and cash borrowing. (See related discussion under "Liquidity and Capital Resources").       We believe this new capital structure positions us to take on a substantial amount of additional new work as well as provide a better matching of our capital asset investment with the long-term revenue and cash flows being generated from our capital assets such as our Opal Gas Plant.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  REVENUE RECOGNITION; PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION METHOD       A number of factors relating to our business affect the recognition of contract revenue. Revenue from fixed-price construction and engineering contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs, taking into consideration physical completion. Total estimated costs, and thus contract income, are impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, and the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation and politics, may affect the progress of a project's completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition. We do not recognize income on a fixed-price contract until the contract is approximately 5% to 10% complete, depending upon the nature of the contract. Costs which are considered to be reimbursable                                          34  are excluded from the percentage-of-completion calculation. Accrued revenue pertaining to reimbursables is limited to the cost of the reimbursables. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined. Revenue from change orders, extra work and variations in the scope of work is recognized when agreement is reached with clients as to the scope of work and when it is probable that the cost of such work will be recovered in a change in contract price. Profit on change orders, extra work and variations in the scope of work is recognized when realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt. Revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with clients as to the value of the claims, which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Revenue from unit-price contracts is recognized as earned. We believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a relatively long time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work and cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized.       All U.S. government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the client. In the event a contract would be terminated at the convenience of the client prior to completion, we will typically be compensated for progress up to the time of termination and any termination costs. Many contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements with liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances that are within our control. In addition, some contracts provide for bonus payments to us for early completion of the project and/or obtainment of specified safety goals.  INCOME TAXES       The determination of our tax provision is complex due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the United States which may be subject to certain risks which ordinarily would not be expected in the United States. Tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes which may be applied on a retroactive basis. If this were to occur, our tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported. Furthermore, in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, we estimate taxable income into the future and determine the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Future taxable income could be materially different than amounts estimated, in which case the valuation allowance would need to be adjusted.  JOINT VENTURE ACCOUNTING       From time to time, we seek one or more joint venture partners when a project requires local content, equipment, manpower or other resources beyond those we have available to complete work in a timely and efficient manner or when we wish to share risk on a particularly large project. We have investments, ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent, in joint ventures that operate in similar lines of business as ours. Investments consist of a 10 percent interest in a consortium for work in Venezuela and a 50 percent interest in a joint venture for work in Africa. Interests in these unconsolidated ventures are accounted for under the equity-method in the consolidated balance sheets and on a proportionate consolidation basis in the consolidated statements of operations. This presentation is consistent with construction industry practice. Alternatively, if we were to account for these interests using the equity-method in the consolidated statement of operations, revenue and contract cost would be materially lower; however, net income would not change.  SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS       We recently reached an agreement with a customer to settle a portion of our contract variations which positively impacted our net income for 2003 by $6.9 million. We currently have over $30 million of outstanding contract variation claims. The timing and amount of potential future revenue recoveries associated with these unresolved contract variations remains uncertain. The claims are primarily related to large projects completed in 2003. The Company is currently in the beginning stages of arbitration on the largest unresolved contract variation relating to the Bolivia Transierra Pipeline project.       In 2003, we completed agreements with Williams Gas Processing Company to design, construct and own a gas processing plant near Opal, Wyoming to process gas production from nearby fields. The Opal Gas Plant was recently completed and began operations in the first quarter of 2004. The plant is designed to process volumes in excess of 350 million standard cubic feet per day of natural gas, producing 7,000 to 11,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids at various operating conditions. We receive an annual processing fee under a 10 year contract through April 2014, and share in the proceeds from the sales of natural gas liquids extracted.                                          35       Late in the third quarter of 2003, Willbros Middle East, Inc. was awarded a project in Iraq for the construction and installation of 15 pipelines ranging in size from 8-inch to 40-inch diameter under a river in northern Iraq by horizontal directional drilling. The contract is currently valued at $50-plus million.       On October 23, 2002, we acquired all outstanding shares of the Mt. West Group. Mt. West Group provides design-build services, including engineering, procurement and construction services to the energy industry, primarily in the western United States. The purchase price of $13.7 million consisted of $4.6 million cash and acquisition costs and 950,000 shares of common stock valued at $9.1 million. In addition, the purchase price will be adjusted by an earn-out amount equal to 25 percent of the combined net income of Mt. West Group for the 24-month period following the date of acquisition. Any earn-out amounts due shall be payable in cash upon completion of the earn-out period. As of December 31, 2003, the Mt. West Group has cumulative net income of $1.0 million since the acquisition date. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase.       On May 14, 2002, we completed a public offering of our common shares at $17.75 per share; 4,356,750 shares were sold by us. The underwriters exercised options to purchase all shares available for over-allotments. We received $71.9 million in proceeds, after the underwriting discount and offering costs, which were used to repay indebtedness under the prior credit agreement and for working capital and general corporate purposes.  OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES  EBITDA       We use EBITDA (earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) as part of our overall assessment of financial performance by comparing EBITDA between accounting periods. We believe that EBITDA is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in businesses similar to ours. EBITDA for 2003 was $16.9 million as compared to $60.1 million in 2002. The $43.2 million decrease in EBITDA is primarily the result of:       -    The $165.0 million decrease in revenue, at 2002's contract margin of           16.4% accounts for $27.1 million of the decrease, and       -    The 3.7% decrease in contract margin in 2003 on $418.7 million in           revenue accounts for another $15.5 million of the decrease.       A reconciliation of EBITDA to GAAP financial information can be found in Item 6, "Selected Financial Data" of this Form 10-K.  BACKLOG       We define anticipated contract revenue as backlog when the award of a contract is reasonably assured, generally upon the execution of a definitive agreement or contract. Anticipated revenue from post-contract award processes, including change orders, extra work, variations in the scope of work and the effect of escalation or currency fluctuation formulas, is not added to backlog until realization is reasonably assured. Backlog as of December 31, 2003 was $224.7 million with an estimated embedded margin of 29.6% compared to $216.0 million at December 31, 2002 with an estimated embedded margin of 22.1%. Included in the December 31, 2003 backlog is $22.0 million of gas processing revenue with an estimated embedded margin of 100%. The gas processing revenue is associated with the 10 year gas processing contract for our Opal Gas Plant entered into during the year. If we were to reduce the 2003 backlog revenue and estimated contract income for the Opal gas processing contract, the estimated embedded margin of work in backlog would be 22.0%. An estimated $170.0 million of the current backlog (74%) is scheduled to be worked off in 2004.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Our contract revenue and contract costs are primarily related to the timing and location of development projects in the oil, gas and power industries worldwide. Contract revenue and cost variations by country from year to year are the result of (a) entering and exiting work countries; (b) the execution of new contract awards; (c) the completion of contracts; and (d) the overall level of activity in our services.                                          36       Our ability to be successful in obtaining and executing contracts can be affected by the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar compared to the currencies of our competitors, our clients and our work locations. During 2003 and 2002, as a result of economic and political events in Venezuela, the Venezuelan Bolivar experienced significant devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar. Included in foreign exchange loss in 2003 and 2002 are foreign exchange losses of $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, resulting from the translation of our Bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars. We do not believe that our revenue or results of operations in other areas were adversely affected in this regard during the years ended December 31, 2003 or 2002. We do not expect any adverse impact from the recent February 2004 devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar.                        FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003,                  COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002  CONTRACT REVENUE       Contract revenue decreased $165.0 million (28%) to $418.7 million in 2003 from $583.7 million in 2002. Engineering revenue declined $141.0 million or 80% in 2003 to $36.2 million from $177.2 million in 2002. The Explorer Pipeline project, which was completed in early 2003 and was not replaced by another comparably sized project, had project revenue of $20.8 million in 2003, compared to $90.9 million in 2002.       Construction revenue also declined $51.1 million or 15% as the result of completing two large projects in the first half of 2003. Construction revenue in 2003 was $293.7 million versus $344.8 million in 2002. The 2003 completion of the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline project resulted in a year-to-year construction revenue decline of $74.5 million. The completion of the Bolivia Transierra Pipeline in early 2003 resulted in an additional $44.4 million in year-to-year construction revenue decline. The combined $118.9 million reduction in construction revenue from the two projects was partially offset by increased revenue related to the Venezuela Ameriven project ($22.1 million), increased work in Oman ($23.7 million), and a full year of Mt. West Group revenue ($23.1 million).       The combined $192.1 million engineering and construction revenue decline was partially offset by a $27.1 million or 44% increase in specialty services revenue. Specialty services revenue in 2003 was $88.8 million versus $61.7 million in 2002. The increase was attributable to new and expanded work in Nigeria and Canada.  CONTRACT COSTS       Contract costs declined $122.6 million or 25% to $365.6 million in 2003 from $488.2 million in 2002. Variations in contract costs by country were closely related to the variations in contract revenue.       The 25% year-to-year contract cost decline versus the equivalent 28% contract revenue decline reflects declining margins accompanying declining revenue. Contract margin for 2003 is down from 2002 levels by 3.7 percentage points at 12.7% versus 16.4%. However, fourth quarter 2003 margins adjusted to remove the effect of the contract variation settlement, were comparable to the same period in the prior year. During 2003, engineering contract costs of $44.6 million exceeded revenue by $8.4 million. Margins declined slightly in construction mainly as a result of completing several large projects where contract variations remain to be settled. Revenue from contract claims is not recognized until agreement is reached with our customers. Specialty Services margin increased slightly.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION       Depreciation and amortization decreased $1.0 million (4%) in 2003 primarily due to a change in the mix of assets and depreciable lines of our property, plant and equipment.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE       G&A expenses increased $2.2 million or 6% to $36.1 million in 2003 versus $33.9 million in 2002. This increase resulted from a full year of G&A expenses for the Mt. West Group acquired on October 23, 2002 and is partially offset by reductions in Venezuela and U.S. engineering G&A expenses. Excluding the Mt. West Group's $3.3 million year-to-year increase, G&A expenses declined $1.1 million primarily as a result of lower staff compensation. We did incur higher G&A expenses in 2003 over 2002 in the following areas:                                          37       -    Bidding and estimating;       -    Insurance; and       -    Legal and consulting.                                           38  NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)       Net interest expense decreased $0.4 million to $1.2 million in 2003 from $1.6 million in 2002. Interest expense was $0.2 million less than 2002 because of reduced debt and capitalized interest related to the construction of our Opal Gas Plant. Interest income increased $0.2 million in 2003 as compared to 2002.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)       Other expenses decreased $1.3 million to $0.2 million in 2003 from $1.5 million in 2002. The $1.3 million decrease is the result of a $0.6 million gain on the disposal of equipment in 2003, a $0.3 million reduction in foreign currency translation losses in 2003 versus 2002, and the occurrence in 2002 of $0.4 million of miscellaneous expenses which were not repeated in 2003.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES       The provision for income taxes in 2003 decreased $8.9 million as compared to 2002 mainly as a result of a $41.8 million decrease in pretax income. Additionally, the tax provision for 2002 received a benefit of $3.3 million because of a reduction to the deferred tax valuation allowance. This was primarily based on our assessment of our United States operations, including past earnings history and projected future earnings, and the scheduled expiration of our tax net operating losses. Although 2003 did not provide the levels of taxable revenue that we contemplated one year ago, we believe the deferred tax attributes will be fully utilized in future years. The effective income tax rate for the year exceeded the United States statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of:       -    Income earned under contracts which provide tax concessions that           eliminate the payment of income taxes, and       -    Utilization of previously NOL carryforwards to offset current income           tax expenses in countries outside of the United States.       These benefits were partially offset by the requirement in certain countries outside of the United States to provide income taxes on a deemed profit which resulted in an effective tax rate which was substantially higher than the United States statutory income tax rate.                        FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002,                  COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001  CONTRACT REVENUE       Contract revenue increased $193.6 million (50%) to $583.7 million due to (a) $130.4 million (60%) of increased construction revenue due primarily to construction on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project, work on a project in Bolivia and increased activity in Offshore West Africa, net of reduced activities on the Nembe Creek Projects in Nigeria as they neared completion and reduced construction activity in the United States; (b) increased engineering revenue of $56.9 million (47%) due to an increase of engineering and procurement services in the United States primarily related to the Explorer Pipeline Project; and (c) an increase of $6.3 million (11%) in Specialty Services revenue principally from revenue generated by MSI in Canada, which was acquired in October 2001, offset by reduced activity in Venezuela. Revenue in the United States increased $26.3 million (13%) due primarily to an increase in engineering and procurement services and the acquisition of Mt. West Group in October 2002, offset by a decrease in construction activity. Chad-Cameroon revenue increased $101.3 million resulting from construction work begun in the fourth quarter of 2001 on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project. Revenue from Offshore West Africa increased $15.3 million as a result of increased vessel utilization on several projects during the first six months of 2002. Work that began in 2002 on a project in Bolivia resulted in $47.4 million in revenue in that country. A project in the Dominican Republic during 2002 produced $17.7 million in revenue, and revenue in Canada increased $10.4 million resulting from the acquisition of MSI in October 2001. Nigeria revenue decreased $19.5 million (29%) due primarily to reduced activity on the Nembe Creek Projects. The combined revenue in all other areas decreased $5.3 million (15%).                                          39  CONTRACT COSTS       Contract costs increased $171.1 million (54%) to $488.3 million due to an increase of $107.7 million (62%) in construction services cost, $54.9 million (56%) in engineering services cost and $8.5 million (19%) in specialty services cost. Variations in contract costs by country were closely related to the variations in contract revenue.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION       Depreciation and amortization increased $3.8 million (19%) due primarily to the addition of equipment for the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project and the project in Bolivia.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE       General and administrative expenses increased $3.9 million (13%) to $33.9 million. This increase is due to higher staff compensation and administrative services necessary to support the 50% increase in revenue. As a percent of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased from 7.7% in 2001 to 5.8% in 2002.  OPERATING INCOME       Operating income increased $5.6 million (17%) from $32.7 million in 2001 to $38.3 million in 2002. Excluding a gain of $9.2 million in 2001 associated with the termination of certain benefit plans, operating income increased $14.8 million (63%). Excluding the gain in 2001, operating income increased largely as a result of higher revenue resulting from greater activity in North America, construction activity on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project and marine maintenance and construction in Offshore West Africa, partially offset by reduced income in Nigeria resulting from a 29% decrease in revenue in that area. The increased income from this 50% increase in revenue was offset by higher depreciation, amortization and general and administrative costs.  NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)       Net interest expense decreased $1.0 million (40%) to $1.6 million. In May 2002, we completed a common stock offering in which we received $71.9 million in net proceeds. Borrowings under our prior credit agreement were paid in full. Interest expense in 2002 includes amortization of debt issue costs of $0.9 million compared to $0.5 million in 2001.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSS       Foreign exchange loss increased $0.9 million to $1.0 million due primarily to the effect of the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar in 2002 on our Venezuelan Bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES       The provision for income taxes decreased $4.9 million (47%) due primarily to the difference between $6.6 million of changes to estimated income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets during 2002 compared to $3.2 million of similar changes during 2001. In addition, during 2002, we recorded a $1.1 million deferred income tax benefit associated with operating losses outside the United States. Changes to the 2002 income tax liabilities include a $1.2 million reduction due to annual settlements of income tax liabilities outside the United States and a $1.0 million reduction resulting from changes in current year estimated tax liabilities outside the United States as a result of the above settlements. In addition, we reduced income taxes in the United States by $1.1 million as a result of the refinement of the allocation of expenses among operating entities and other items affecting estimated tax liabilities in the United States and a $3.3 million reduction in the deferred tax assets valuation allowance. We reduced our U.S. valuation allowance as a result of our assessment of our United States operations including past earnings history and projected future earnings considering the scheduled expiration of our tax net operating losses. Changes in 2001 resulted from a $2.3 million reduction in the deferred assets valuation allowance in the United States and a $0.9 million reduction from annual settlements income taxes outside the United States. The provision for income taxes is also impacted by the differing income tax rates in the various countries in which we operate, including for                                          40  example Nigeria where income taxes are largely based on deemed profit rather than taxable income as well as a tax holiday in Cameroon for income earned on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS       Our primary requirements for capital are to acquire, upgrade and maintain equipment, provide working capital for current projects, finance the mobilization of employees and equipment to new projects, establish a presence in countries where we perceive growth opportunities and finance the possible acquisition of new businesses and equity investments. Historically, we have met these capital requirements primarily from operating cash flows, and more recently from a 2002 equity offering and borrowings under our credit facility.  WORKING CAPITAL       Cash and cash equivalents decreased $28.5 million (58%) to $21.0 million at December 31, 2003, from $49.5 million at December 31, 2002. The decrease consists of $39.2 million used in investing activities, including the design and construction of our Opal Gas Plant, the acquisition of equipment and spare parts, and $7.8 million used in operating activities, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and contract cost and recognized income not yet billed, principally in Nigeria. These negative cash flows are partially offset by $18.5 million cash provided by financing activities, including $14.0 million from borrowings under the line of credit and $4.3 million from capital lease obligations entered into in 2003. Working capital and stockholders' equity remained fairly constant from year-to-year, both decreasing less than 1%.       We believe the anticipated increase in revenue, improvement in contract margins and a focus on reducing the working capital requirements in Nigeria, will return the Company to positive cash flow from operations in 2004.  2.75% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES       On March 12, 2004, we completed a $60.0 million 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the "Convertible Notes") offering to enhance our competitive position in the market place and provide a better matching of the funding of capital assets with the revenue and cash flow streams they are generating.       The Convertible Notes will be general senior unsecured obligations. Interest will be paid semi-annually on March 15th and September 15th, beginning on September 15, 2004. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 15, 2024 unless the notes are repurchased, redeemed or converted earlier. We may redeem the Convertible Notes for cash on or after March 15, 2011, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. The holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase the Convertible Notes, including unpaid interest, on March 15, 2011, 2014, and 2019 or upon a change of control related event. On March 15, 2011 and upon a change in control event, we must pay the purchase price in cash. On March 15, 2014 and 2019, we have the option of providing common stock in lieu of cash or a combination of common stock and cash to fund repurchases. The holders of the Convertible Notes may convert, under certain circumstances, the notes into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion ratio of 51.3611 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (representing a conversion price of approximately $19.47 per share). Net proceeds of approximately $57.2 million will be used for working capital, to repay $14.0 million of indebtedness under the $125.0 million June 2002 credit agreement and for general corporate purposes.  RESTATED AND EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY       On March 12, 2004, the existing June 2002 credit agreement was amended and restated (the "2004 Credit Facility"). The 2004 Credit Facility will mature on March 12, 2007. The 2004 Credit Facility may be used for standby and commercial letters of credit, borrowings or a combination thereof. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of 40% of the borrowing base or $30.0 million and are payable at termination on March 12, 2007. Interest is payable quarterly at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.00% or a Eurodollar Rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 3.00%. A commitment fee on the unused portion of the 2004 Credit Facility is payable quarterly ranging from 0.375% to 0.625%. The 2004 Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets, including stock of the principal subsidiaries, restricts the payment of cash dividends and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. The borrowing base is                                          41  calculated using varying percentages of cash, accounts receivable, accrued revenue, contract cost and recognized income not yet billed, property, plant and equipment, and spare parts.       Debt issue costs of $2.6 million associated with the 2004 Credit Facility and the remaining $0.6 million of unamortized debt issue costs related to the June 2002 credit agreement will be amortized over a 24 month period.       At December 31, 2003, $14.0 million was borrowed under the June 2002 credit agreement and was repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes. We had $41.0 million in letters of credit outstanding leaving a total of $40.3 million available for the issuance of letters of credit and $6.0 million for borrowings or a combination thereof. Based on a covenant waiver agreement discussed below, total cash borrowings may not exceed $20.0 million. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, unamortized debt issue cost was $0.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively.  COVENANT WAIVER       On October 31, 2003, we obtained a Consent and Waiver Agreement (the "Agreement") from our syndicated bank group to waive non-compliance with certain financial covenants in our credit June 2002 agreement and to agree to a method for calculating the borrowing base that eliminates the multiple of EBITDA calculation through the filing of the February 2004 borrowing base certificate. The Agreement provided waivers for certain quarterly financial covenants through December 31, 2003. If we had not obtained the Agreement, we would have been in default of the June 2002 credit agreement. The Agreement limits cash borrowings under the June 2002 credit agreement to $20.0 million and the total borrowing base available for cash borrowing and the issuance of standby letters of credit may not exceed $75.0 million.  LIQUIDITY       We believe that cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the 2004 Credit Facility and the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes offering will be sufficient to finance working capital and capital expenditures for ongoing operations at our present level of activity and will provide capacity for expected growth. Capital expenditures for equipment and spare parts in 2004 are estimated at $30.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Also, we may be required to make additional payments during 2004 related to the Mt. West Group acquisition based on a 25% of net income earn-out provision covering the two-year period following the acquisition date. We believe that while there are numerous factors that could and will have an impact on our cash flow, both positively and negatively, there are not one or two events that, should they occur, could not be funded from our operations or borrowing capacity. For a list of events which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and a discussion of risk factors that could impact cash flow, please refer to the section entitled "Political and Economic Risks; Operational Risks" contained in Items 1 & 2 in this Form 10-K.

We had $41.0 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $40.3 million available for letters of credit and $6.0 million for borrowings.       Capital lease obligations include approximately $3.9 million to a leasing company under a four-year capital lease in connection with the ongoing acquisition and installation of new corporate information systems and infrastructure. The lease amount increases quarterly based on costs incurred to a maximum value of $7.0 million.                                          42       We have certain operating leases for equipment, office and camp facilities. Minimum lease commitments under operating leases as of December 31, 2003, totaled $7.9 million and are payable as follows: 2004, $2.3 million; 2005, $2.0 million; 2006, $1.5 million; 2007, $0.9 million; 2008, $0.8 million and later years, $0.4 million.       Based upon the above, our total cash obligations are payable as follows: 2004, $3.7 million; 2005-2006, $19.8 million; 2007-2008, $2.7 million; and later years, $0.4 million.       Additionally, we have various notes and leases payable, generally related to equipment financing and local revolving credit facilities. All notes and leases are at market interest rates, and are collateralized by certain vehicles, equipment and/or real estate.       We have unsecured credit facilities with banks in certain countries outside the United States. Borrowings under these lines, in the form of short-term notes and overdrafts, are made at competitive local interest rates. Generally, each line is available only for borrowings related to operations in a specific country. Credit available under these facilities is approximately $5.8 million at December 31, 2003. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2003.       We do not anticipate any significant collection problems with our customers, including those in countries that may be experiencing economic and/or currency difficulties. Since our customers generally are major oil companies and government entities, and the terms for billing and collecting for work performed are generally established by contracts, we historically have a very low incidence of collectability problems.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS       From time to time we enter into commercial commitments, usually in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit, insurance bonds and financial guarantees. Contracts with our customers may require us to provide letters of credit or insurance bonds with regard to our performance of contracted services. In such cases, the commitments can be called upon in the event of our failure to perform contracted services. Likewise, contracts may allow us to issue letters of credit or insurance bonds in lieu of contract retention provisions, in which the client withholds a percentage of the contract value until project completion or expiration of a warranty period.       In connection with our 10% interest in a joint venture in Venezuela, we issued a corporate guarantee equal to 10% of the joint venture's outstanding borrowings with two banks. The guarantee reduces as borrowings are repaid, and expires in March 2004. The commitment as of December 31, 2003 totals $3.6 million, the maximum amount of future payments we could be required to make.       A summary of our off-balance sheet commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003 is as follows:                                                                                       AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT                                                                                    EXPIRATION PER PERIOD                                                                            ------------------------------------                                                                               TOTAL                   LESS THAN                                                                            COMMITMENT                  2 YEARS                                                                            ----------                 --------                                                                                 (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS)      Letters of Credit:      Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project - performance                          $      21.3               $      21.3      Bolivia Project - performance                                                 8.9                       8.9      Other - performance and retention                                            10.8                      10.8                                                                            -----------               -----------      Total letters of credit                                                      41.0                      41.0                                                                            -----------               ----------- Insurance Bonds - primarily performance related:      Expiring                                                                      3.2                       3.2      Non-expiring                                                                   --                        --                                                                            -----------               -----------      Total insurance bonds                                                         3.2                       3.2                                                                            -----------               -----------  Corporate guarantee                                                                3.6                       3.6                                                                            -----------               -----------  Total commercial commitments                                               $      47.8               $      47.8                                                                            ===========               ===========                                           43       These commercial commitments totaling $47.8 million represent the maximum amount of future payments we could be required to make. We had no liability recorded as of December 31, 2003, related to these commitments.                                           44  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51," ("FIN 46"). The interpretation states that certain variable interest entities may be required to be consolidated into the results of operations and financial position of the entity that is the primary beneficiary. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after December 15, 2003, the revised effective date, to variable entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. FIN 46 applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 46 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.       In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123". This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. Certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.       In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34". This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. The Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002.       In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities", which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs. SFAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 146 for restructuring activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under Issue 94-3, a liability for an exit cost is recognized at the date of our commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. Accordingly, SFAS No. 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized.       In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of SFAS No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13 and Technical Corrections". SFAS No. 145 provides guidance for income statement classification of gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. We adopted SFAS No. 145 in January 2003 and such adoption did not materially affect our consolidated financial statements.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES       Our operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation, government mandates or other economic factors, in the countries in which we operate. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain of our major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work.                                          45  ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Our primary market risk is our exposure to changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates. We attempt to negotiate contracts which provide for payment in U.S. dollars, but we may be required to take all or a portion of payment under a contract in another currency. To mitigate non-U.S. currency exchange risk, we seek to match anticipated non-U.S. currency revenue with expenses in the same currency whenever possible. To the extent we are unable to match non-U.S. currency revenue with expenses in the same currency, we may use forward contracts, options or other common hedging techniques in the same non-U.S. currencies. We had no forward contracts or options at December 31, 2003 and 2002.       The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value at December 31, 2003 due to the generally short maturities of these items. We invest primarily in short-term dollar denominated bank deposits, and at December 31, 2003 did not have any investment in instruments with a maturity of more than a few days or in any equity securities. We have the ability and expect to hold our investments to maturity.       Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt. At December 31, 2003, $14.0 million of indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates. The weighted average effective interest rate on the variable rate debt for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was 5.0%. The detrimental effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates for the year would be less than $0.1 million. At December 31, 2003, our fixed rate debt approximated fair value based upon discounted future cash flows using current market rates.                                          46  ITEM 8.
