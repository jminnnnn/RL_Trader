ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and these differences may be material.            The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.    Inventories             Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost methods. The production and accounting process utilized by the Company to record recycled metals inventory quantities relies on significant estimates. The Company relies upon perpetual inventory records that utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based upon historical trends and periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities. Over time, these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced; however, actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of the estimates, the Company not only runs periodic tests, but also performs physical inventories. Physical inventories can normally detect significant variations in volume, but because of    25           variations in product density, holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product physical inventories will not generally detect smaller variations. To mitigate this risk, the Company adjusts it physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory can more accurately predict the remaining volume.    Revenue Recognition             The Company recognizes revenue when it has a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price, the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer, and collectibility is reasonably assured which is generally upon shipment. Title for both recycled metals and finished steel products transfers upon shipment. Substantially all of the Company's ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit, minimizing credit risk. However, domestic ferrous recycled metal sales, non-ferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account. Historically, there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues, therefore no provisions are made when the sale is recognized.    Bad Debt Reserves             The Company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts, notes and advances receivable based on a combination of factors. In cases where management is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance against amounts due and reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we maintain a reserve that considers the total receivables outstanding, historical collection rates and economic trends.    Environmental Costs             The Company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks. To manage these risks, the Company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants. These consultants and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks. The Company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. The regulatory and government management of these projects is extremely complex, which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation of potential sites. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonable established, and no other amount within the range is better than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded in the financial statements. Adjustments to the liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to remediate. In a number of cases, it is possible the Company may receive reimbursement through prior insurance. In these situations, recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable.     Deferred Taxes             Deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.    26          Results of Operations             The results of operations of the Company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the Western United States. For example, increasing steel demand and prices led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal 1995 through fiscal 1997. However, during fiscal 1998 and 1999, the Asian financial crisis severely curtailed demand and decreased prices, causing a negative impact on the results of the Metal Recycling Business. During fiscal 2000, the Company saw demand for recycled metal rise, but unusually large supplies of recycled ferrous metal became available in certain of the countries that were part of the former Soviet Union, thereby holding prices down. In addition, domestic demand for finished steel products was strong, but lower cost imports, primarily from Asia, caused average prices to generally decline. In fiscal 2001, the demand for recycled metals declined in the United States as domestic steel production declined; however, demand in Asia, particularly in China, remained firm. Selling prices also continued to be adversely affected by supplies coming out of the former Soviet Union. Demand for finished steel products declined due to the slowing United States economy and competition from lower cost imports.            During the first six months of fiscal 2002, recycled metals prices approached record lows due primarily to weak domestic demand. However, in the second half of the fiscal year, prices rose due to improved demand from domestic steel producers. In addition, exports of recycled metal from the former Soviet Union were restrained by higher export taxes and selected export bans. However, domestic demand for finished steel remained sluggish in the Western United States throughout fiscal 2002. United States tariffs on selected steel products announced in March 2002 had little effect on most of the products produced by the Steel Manufacturing Business, namely rebar and merchant bar. The result was a record low average net selling price for the Steel Manufacturing Business.            The following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the Company's Metals Recycling Business and Steel Manufacturing Business, and the breakdown of income from operations between the Metals Recycling Business, the Steel Manufacturing Business, Joint Ventures, Corporate and eliminations. Additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.             Revenues  Year Ended August 31,             2002     2001     2000             (In millions)         Metals Recycling Business:                                     Ferrous     $  173.5     $  155.6     $  164.0          Nonferrous        41.7        43.0        38.9          Other        6.6        6.5        8.0                              Recycled metals total        221.8        205.1        210.9          Sales to the Steel Manufacturing Business(1)        (37.7  )     (49.9  )     (47.0  )                           Sales to Unaffiliated Customers        184.1        155.2        163.9        Steel Manufacturing Business         166.6         167.6         203.6                              Total     $  350.7     $  322.8     $  367.5                            27                   Income (Loss) from Operations  Year Ended August 31,             2002     2001     2000             (In millions)         Metals Recycling Business(4)     $  11.4     $  7.9     $  12.9       Steel Manufacturing Business        (5.8  )     4.9        7.2       JVs in the Metals Recycling Business(2)        13.8        6.5        2.2       JV Suppliers of Metals        5.6        3.3        2.3       Corporate Expense(3)        (8.5  )     (8.4  )     (8.4  )    Intercompany Eliminations        (0.2  )     (0.1  )     (1.0  )    Impairment and other nonrecurring charges(4)        (7.1  )                                           Income from Operations     $  9.2     $  14.1     $  15.2                               (1) Ferrous recycled metal sales from the Metals Recycling Business to the Steel Manufacturing Business are made at a negotiated rate per ton that is intended to approximate market. (2) Includes year-end LIFO adjustments that reduced income from operations by $1.2 million and $1.1 million in fiscal 2002 and 2000, respectively, and increased income from operations by $0.9 million in fiscal 2001. This adjustment was partially offset in fiscal 2002 by a $0.9 million gain from a nonrecurring sale of JV property. (3) Corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expense for services that benefit both the Metals Recycling Business and the Steel Manufacturing Business. Because of this unallocated expense, the income from operations of each segment does not reflect the income from operations the segment would have as a stand-alone business. (4) Impairment and other nonrecurring charges related to the Metals Recycling Business. The amount is shown separately to assist in understanding the business' financial results.     Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001             Revenues.     Consolidated revenues increased $27.9 million (9%) to $350.7 million for fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001. Revenues for the Metals Recycling Business increased due to higher selling prices and volumes as worldwide demand for ferrous metals strengthened through the year. Revenues for the Steel Manufacturing Business were slightly lower primarily due to lower average net selling prices partially offset by increased sales volumes.            The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $221.8 million, before intercompany eliminations, an increase of $16.7 million (8%). Ferrous revenues increased $17.9 million (12%) to $173.5 million as a result of an increase in tons sold and higher average selling prices net of shipping cost (average net selling prices). Ferrous volumes increased 75,100 tons (5%) and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased $4 to $94 per ton (5%). Diminished supplies of ferrous recycled metals from the countries of the former Soviet Union and growing worldwide demand drove the volume and price increases. Asia, especially China and Korea, continues to be the primary destination of export sales. In fiscal 2002, the Metals Recycling Business made export shipments aggregating 1,068,000 tons, an increase of 290,000 tons (37%) compared with fiscal 2001. Because of the continued soft United States economy, domestic third-party ferrous tonnage decreased 56,000 ton (41%) to 82,000 tons. Sales to the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business decreased 28% to 407,000 tons due to production curtailments in this business. Nonferrous revenues decreased $1.3 million (3%) to $41.7 million due to a corresponding reduction in sales volume. The average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal 2002 was $0.36 per pound, a decline of $0.01 per pound from fiscal 2001.    28                  The Steel Manufacturing Business recognized revenues of $166.6 million in fiscal 2002, a decrease of 1% from revenues recognized in the prior year. The volume of finished steel products sold increased, but the average net selling price per ton decreased compared with fiscal 2001. Sales of finished steel products were up 4% to 569,000 tons while the average net selling price per ton decreased $16 per ton (5%) to $276 per ton, a record low. The decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to lower average net selling prices for all major product lines which were partially offset by the increase in sales volumes. The decrease in the average sales price per ton is primarily due to the sluggish United States economy and weak end user demand, continuing competition from lower cost steel imports and a shift in product mix from merchant bar to wire rod. The increase in sales volume was due to a 31% greater sales volume of wire rod, which was partially offset by a decline in the sales volume of merchant bar. The higher wire rod volume was due to additional demand by a major customer. Tariffs on selected imported steel products enacted in March and April 2002 by the International Trade Commission (ITC) under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act did not produced any significant price benefits. In October 2002, the ITC announced duty margins of up to 360% and subsidy rates of up to 18% against foreign producers of wire rod products from eight foreign countries. It is anticipated that these duties, if they remain in effect, will favorably impact the Steel Manufacturing Business' wire rod prices.            Cost of Goods Sold.     Consolidated cost of goods increased $33.1 million (11%) to $324.4 million and was 93% percent of revenues compared with 90% in fiscal 2001. The increase to 93% was primarily due to eroded margins for the Steel Manufacturing Business. Gross profit decreased $5.1 million (16%) to $26.3 million.            Cost of goods sold for the Metals Recycling Business increased $10.7 million (6%) to $192.8 million before intercompany eliminations. The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from 89% for fiscal 2001 to 87% during fiscal 2002, contributing to a $5.9 million increase in gross profit. This increase in gross margin in fiscal 2002 was primarily attributable to higher selling prices and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher prices paid to suppliers for ferrous recycled metals, resulting in a $3 per ton (4%) increase in the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton. Cost of sales per ferrous ton increased as higher selling prices and higher demand for processed metal pushed up the purchase price the Company paid for unprocessed metal. Lower shipping costs per ton partially offset the purchase price increases. Competition from other recyclers for the purchase of unprocessed metal was also a factor in the cost increases.            Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business increased $9.9 million (6%) to $169.1 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 95% in fiscal 2001 to over 100% in fiscal 2002. The increase was due to higher fixed costs being spread over fewer production tons as mill curtailments that began in August 2001 continued throughout fiscal 2002. Melt shop production fell 41% and rolling mill production fell 12% compared with fiscal 2001. Also, contributing to the increase was a 15% rise in energy costs. Energy cost increased due to the 2001 Western energy shortage which increased contracted power rates. Average cost of sales per ton increased $4 per ton (1%) compared with the prior fiscal year. This increased cost of sales per ton, combined with the $16 per ton reduction in average net selling price, resulted in a decrease in gross profit of $10.9 million (130%) in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001.            Impairment and Other Nonrecurring Charges.     The Company recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges of $7.1 million in fiscal 2002. The Company recorded nonrecurring charges of $1.9 million for the early termination of a fixed-price Alaska barge contract of affreightment that management determined was not cost effective. The Alaska barge contract charge included a $0.9 million write-off of a note receivable and a $1.0 million payment to terminate the contract. Also, an impairment charge of $1.8 million was recorded for the elimination of an unprofitable car-crushing business and an impairment charge of $1.1 million was recorded for the closure of an under-performing yard in Reno, Nevada. The Company now sublets the Reno facility and leases the equipment to a third    29           party that sells its recycled metal output to the Company. Nonrecurring charges of $1.5 million were recorded for the loss on the early termination of two vessel charter contracts with a related company. The Company terminated the leases in order to take advantage of market rates which were $7 to $8 per ton lower than the all-in contracted rates. Shipping cost savings as a result of the contract termination totalled approximately $2.0 million. Additionally, a loss of $0.8 million was recorded for the sale of a non-strategic steel forging business.            A number of the charges were a direct result of the Company's 2001 implementation of Economic Value Added (EVA) which is a tool used to measure financial performance and acceptable returns on investment as well as compensate management on the change in EVA performance. Since implementing EVA, the Company has re-analyzed the business performance and related outlook for many of its assets. The result of these reviews, using the EVA tool, led to many operational and management changes in the Company's business.             Income from Joint Ventures.     The Company's joint ventures' revenues and results of operations were as follows (in thousands):             Year Ended August 31,          2002     2001    Total revenues from external customers recognized by:                      Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business     $  625,119     $  555,963    Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals        61,762        53,381                       $  686,881     $  609,344                  Income from joint ventures recognized by the Company:                        Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business     $  13,766     $  6,549    Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals        5,624        3,288                       $  19,390     $  9,837                            The Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals. The increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices and an increase in tonnage shipped. Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to 3.5 million tons for the year ended August 31, 2002 from 3.1 million tons in the prior year. The average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to $90 per ton from $86 per ton, predominantly due to strong demand from Asia, especially China and Korea. These joint ventures also increased their sales margins by improving operational efficiencies.             In fiscal 2002, the Company's share of income from Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business increased to $13.8 million due to increased sales volume, higher average net selling prices, increased margins and more efficient operations. The Company's joint ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation, which earned the majority of the income, instituted EVA concurrently with the Company in fiscal 2001. The use of EVA has continued to result in improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability. Operating income in fiscal 2002 was reduced by $1.2 million representing the Company's share of the JV LIFO inventory adjustment compared with a benefit of $0.9 million in fiscal 2001. Operating income in fiscal 2002 also benefited by $0.9 million representing the Company's share of a nonrecurring gain on sale of JV property.             Both revenues and income from the Joint Venture Suppliers of Metal increased from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 primarily due to increased sales by the Company's self-service auto dismantling joint venture. Increased sales prices, more efficient operations, and lower interest costs drove the revenue growth and income improvements.    30        NAME="page_dm1157_1_31">                Selling and Commission Expenses.     These expenses increased $0.8 million compared with fiscal 2001 primarily due to an increase in export commission expense caused from higher ferrous recycled metals export sales.             General and Administrative Expenses.     Compared with fiscal 2001, general and administrative expenses increased $1.4 million primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in wages as a result of annual merit increases and bonus accruals related to the Company's EVA performance and a $0.4 million in increased insurance expense due to adverse insurance market conditions since September 11, 2001.            Interest Expense.     In fiscal 2002, interest expense decreased $2.8 million compared with fiscal 2001 due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates. The Company's borrowings averaged $75.9 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $81.5 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in average borrowings reflects improved cash flow as a result of substantial decreases in inventory during fiscal 2002. The average interest rate for fiscal 2002 was 2.7% compared with 5.8% for fiscal 2001.            Other Income.     Other income decreased $1.1 million in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001 primarily due to a $1.6 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates charged on variable interest rate advances and notes to joint venture businesses. In addition, this line item includes market value adjustments for changes in investment performance for securities held in a trust for the purpose of funding future non-qualified pension payments. During fiscal 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized losses from the trust fund assets in the amount of $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively.            Income Tax Provision.     As part of the 1996 acquisition of Proler International Corp. (Proler), the Company acquired $31.4 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). Prior to fiscal 2000, federal tax law placed limitations on the source of the income that could be offset by the NOLs. Accordingly, the Company was not able to record the potential tax benefits from the NOLs because of the lack of certainty in being able to realize these benefits. In fiscal 2000, a change in federal tax law allowed the Company to use the NOLs to offset taxable income from all sources, subject to a limit of $2.4 million per year. During fiscal 2001, the Company continued to benefit from the use of $2.4 million of NOLs, which was one of the primary reasons the effective rate was 30% as compared to the statutory rate of 34%.            In fiscal 2002, it was determined that the Company qualified for $2.1 million of Enterprise Zone tax credits in the state of California. These credits can be used to offset California state income taxes to the extent that each corporation in the consolidated group has a California franchise (income) tax liability. Any credits in excess of the tax liability can be carried forward indefinitely. The combination of NOLs and Enterprise Zone tax credits made the Company's effective tax rate 14% for fiscal 2002 as compared with a statutory rate of 34%.             As noted above, Federal income tax law limits the Company's use of NOLs to $2.4 million per year. Unused NOLs may be carried forward and used in subsequent fiscal years, though they will ultimately expire in fiscal years 2007 through 2012, if not used by then. Subject to the annual limit, there remains at August 31, 2002 $17.7 million of Proler NOLs that may be used in future years before they expire.     Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000             Revenues.     Revenues for both the Metals Recycling Business and Steel Manufacturing Business were lower as consolidated revenues decreased $44.7 million to $322.8 million for fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000.            The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $205.1 million, before intercompany eliminations, a decrease of $5.8 million (3%). Ferrous revenues decreased $8.4 million (5%) to    31           $155.6 million primarily as a result of lower average net selling prices. Ferrous volumes decreased 24,600 tons (2%) and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal decreased $4 per ton to $91 per ton (4%). However, prices firmed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as the volume of lower cost ferrous recycled metal from the countries of the former Soviet Union diminished. The Metals Recycling Business made export shipments aggregating 777,000 tons, an increase of 16,000 tons (2%) in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000. Demand from Asia, particularly China, has remained strong and pushed ferrous export tons higher in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000. Because of the softening United States economy domestic third-party ferrous tonnage decreased 108,000 ton (44%). Sales to the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business increased 13% to 566,000 tons due to an increase in melt shop production at the Company's steel mini-mill. Nonferrous revenues increased $4.1 million (11%) to $43.0 million due primarily to higher volumes. Improvements in the processes used to extract metal from the automobile shredding process and a temporary backlog of unprocessed shredder residue provided higher volumes of nonferrous metals, increasing sales volume by 18.2 million pounds (19%) in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000. The average nonferrous selling price decreased $0.03 per pound (8%) due to slowing demand caused primarily by the slowdown in the United States economy.            The Steel Manufacturing Business recognized revenues of $167.6 million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 18% from revenues recognized in the prior year. Sales of finished steel products declined 18% to 546,000 tons while the average net selling price per ton increased $3 per ton (1%) to $292 per ton. The decrease in sales volumes came from all major product lines with the exception of reinforcing bar, for which sales volume approximated prior year levels. The slight increase in the average sales price per ton is primarily due to the change in product mix. During fiscal 2001, the Company focused on selling those products, such as reinforcing bar, which have higher margins. The slowing United States economy, as well as competition from lower cost steel imports, continues to impact sales volumes and prices. On June 5, 2001, President Bush asked the United States International Trade Commission to investigate the effects of steel imports on the domestic steel industry under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act. The Commission has determined that some steel imports were a threat to domestic steel producers, and the President imposed safeguard restrictions on steel imports to aid the steel industry.            Cost of Goods Sold.     Consolidated cost of goods sold decreased $38.2 million (12%) to $291.3 million and was 90% of revenues, consistent with fiscal 2000. However, gross profit decreased $6.4 million (17%) to $31.6 million.            Cost of goods sold for the Metals Recycling Business decreased $0.3 million to $181.9 million before intercompany eliminations. Cost of sales per ferrous ton decreased as demand for processed metal declined, allowing the Company to lower the price paid for unprocessed metal. Gross profit decreased $4.1 million (15%) compared with the prior fiscal year as the decline in the cost of unprocessed ferrous metal was more than offset by a decrease in the average net selling price per ton for ferrous recycled metal.            Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business decreased $33.7 million (17%) reflecting the lower sales volume for fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000. Cost of sales per ton, excluding billets, increased $4 per ton (1%) compared with the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to decreased production volume, that spread fixed costs over fewer tons, and a higher volume of sales to California, which have higher freight and distribution costs than sales in the Pacific Northwest. This increased cost of sales per ton resulted in a decrease in gross profit of $2.4 million (22%) in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000.    32                  Income from Joint Ventures.     The Company's joint ventures' revenues and results of operations were as follows (in thousands):             Year Ended August 31,          2001     2000    Total revenues from external customers recognized by:                      Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business     $  555,963     $  521,701    Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals        53,381        52,444                       $  609,344     $  574,145                  Income from joint ventures recognized by the Company:                        Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business     $  6,549     $  2,219    Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals        3,288        2,288                       $  9,837     $  4,507                            The Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals. The decrease in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to lower average ferrous selling prices partially offset by an increase in tonnage shipped. Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to 3.1 million tons for the year ended August 31, 2001 from 2.8 million tons in the prior year. The average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal decreased during that period to $86 per ton from $108 per ton, predominantly due to competition from the countries of the former Soviet Union as well as lower demand from domestic steel mills. The lower ferrous revenues were partially offset by higher nonferrous revenues. This increase was due to greater nonferrous metal recovery from higher ferrous volumes processed and improved processes for the extraction of nonferrous metals.            In fiscal 2001, the Company's share of income from Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business increased to $6.5 million due to increased sales volume, increased margins and more efficient operations. The Company's joint ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation, which earned the majority of the income, instituted EVA concurrently with the Company. This led to improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability. Also, the Hugo Neu joint ventures were able to lower buying prices as selling prices declined. The Company also benefited by $0.9 million to reflect the Company's share of LIFO inventory adjustments. In comparison, the results for fiscal 2000 were adversely affected by a $1.1 million LIFO inventory adjustment.            Both revenues and income from the Joint Venture Suppliers of Metal increased from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 primarily due to increased sales by the Company's self-service auto dismantling joint venture. Increased sales prices and lower interest costs drove the improvements.            Selling and Commission Expenses.     Compared with fiscal 2000, there was a decrease of $0.4 million. This was primarily due to lower commission expense for the Metals Recycling Business due to a decrease in ferrous recycled metals export sales.             Interest Expense.     Interest expense decreased $2.8 million due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates. The Company averaged borrowings of $81.5 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $107.4 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease in average borrowings reflects a substantial decrease in borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 due primarily to inventory reductions then and during the first half of fiscal 2001, as well as a $7.5 million improvement in cash flow from the Company's joint ventures. This lower borrowing level continued through fiscal 2001. The average interest rate for fiscal 2001 was 5.8% compared with 6.3% for fiscal 2000.    33                  Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets.     Fiscal 2001 gain (loss) on sale of assets improved by $1.5 million. The increase is mainly attributable to the fact that last year's amount included a loss of $1.0 million on the sale of a vessel used to export recycled metal.            Other Income.     Other income decreased $2.3 million in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000 primarily due to a $1.6 million change in gains and losses recognized on trust fund assets of a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan for certain Company executives. Other income was also adversely impacted by lower average interest rates on advances and notes to joint venture partners, resulting in a decrease of $0.2 million.            Income Tax Provision.     As part of the 1996 acquisition of Proler International, Corp. (Proler), the Company acquired $31.4 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). Prior to fiscal 2000, federal tax law placed limitations on the source of the income that could be offset by the NOLs. Accordingly, the Company was not able to record the potential tax benefits from the NOLs because of the lack of certainty in being able to realize these benefits. In fiscal 2000, federal tax law was amended, which allowed the Company to utilize the NOLs to offset substantially all of its taxable income. As a result, in fiscal 2000, the Company utilized $8.5 million of NOLs in determining its effective tax rate, which included a catch-up of $6.2 million of NOLs. This change in tax law resulted in an effective tax of 6% in fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2001, the Company continued to benefit from the utilization of $2.4 million of NOLs, and was one of the primary reasons the effective rate was only 30% as compared to the statutory rate of 34%.            As noted above, Federal income tax law limits the Company's use of NOLs to $2.4 million per year. Unused NOLs may be carried forward and used in subsequent fiscal years, though they will ultimately expire in fiscal years 2007 through 2012, if not used by then. Subject to the annual limit, there remained at August 31, 2001 $20.1 million of Proler NOLs that may be used in future years before they expire.    Liquidity and Capital Resources.             For fiscal 2002, cash generated by operations was $36.4 million, compared to $8.6 million last year. The increase in cash flow provided by operations was primarily the result of improved operating profits before nonrecurring items and lower year-end inventories. Cash was also generated by $31.4 million of net cash distributed from the Company's joint ventures, $15.6 million of which was attributable to barrowings under the new joint venture credit facility discussed below net of the increase in cash retained by the joint ventures.            Capital expenditures totaled $9.6 million, $9.3 million and $10.7 million for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Because of generally poor market conditions, coupled with larger capital investments in the mid to late 1990's, the Company has focused its capital investment on non-discretionary capital and investments with shorter paybacks.            As part of its acquisitions of Proler and MMI, the Company assumed environmental liabilities that aggregated $21.1 million as of August 31, 2002. The Company expects significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of such environmental liabilities.            The Company has an unsecured revolving credit agreement of $200 million that expires in June 2003. In the aggregate, the Company had borrowings outstanding under this line of $60 million as of August 31, 2002. The $60 million is classified as a current liability as the credit agreement expires during fiscal 2003. Management intends to replace the bank credit facility with a new agreement. Further, Management believes it has the ability to refinance the facility based upon the Company's financial position and from preliminary discussions with various banks that participate in its current facility. As of August 31, 2002, the Company had additional uncommitted lines of credit available of    34           $40 million. The Company's debt agreements have certain restrictive covenants. As of August 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.            In July 2002, the Company's metals recycling joint ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation entered into a $70 million revolving credit facility ("JV Credit Facility") with a group of banks for working capital and general credit purposes. Prior to this time, the joint ventures' working capital and other cash needs had been met by advances provided equally by the Company and Hugo Neu Corporation. The JV Credit Facility expires in July 2004, is secured by the inventory and receivables of the joint venture businesses and has a negative pledge on the remaining assets. The Company is not a guarantor of the JV Credit Facility. The JV Credit Facility has a number of covenants and restrictions, including restrictions on the level of distributions to the joint venture partners. As of August 31, 2002, the joint ventures were in compliance with such covenants. Borrowings under the JV Credit Facility totaled $35.0 million at August 31, 2002.            The Company has certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments to make future payments. The following table summarizes these future obligations and commitments as of August 31, 2002 (in thousands):             Total     Less than  1 Year     1-3  Years     4-5  Years     After 5  Years    Long-term debt     $  68,525     $  60,220     $  558     $  47     $  7,700    Operating leases        99,417        2,239        5,751        1,640        89,787    Letters of Credit        4,900        4,900                            JV Credit Facility (50%)(1)        17,500                17,500                                             Total     $  190,342     $  67,359     $  23,809     $  1,687     $  97,487                                 (1) This disclosure assumes that if the JV Credit Facility is not renewed or refinanced upon expiration, the Company and Hugo Neu Corporation would restore their previous arrangement under which each funded one-half of the joint ventures' cash needs.            Pursuant to a stock repurchase program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 3 million shares of its stock when the market price of the Company's stock is not reflective of management's opinion of an appropriate valuation of the stock. Management believes that repurchasing shares under these conditions enhances shareholder value and helps the Company manage its targeted capital structure. As of August 31, 2002, a total of 1.3 million shares had been purchased under this program. During fiscal 2002, the Company repurchased 98,600 shares of its stock for a total of $1.3 million.            The Company believes that the current cash balance, internally generated funds, existing credit facilities and its anticipation of being able to refinance its credit facilities will provide adequate financing for capital expenditures, working capital, joint ventures, stock repurchases, debt service requirements and future environmental obligations for the next year. In the longer term, the Company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing.             Factors That Could Affect Future Results.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934, and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. One can generally identify these forward-looking statements because they contain "expect", "believe" and other words which convey a similar meaning. One can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Examples of factors affecting Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.'s    35           wholly-owned operations and its joint ventures (the Company) that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following:            Cyclicality and General Market Considerations:     Selling prices for recycled metals are highly cyclical in nature and subject to worldwide economic conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of recycled metals are subject to volatile supply and demand conditions beyond the Company's control, resulting in periodic fluctuations in recycled metals prices. While the Company attempts to maintain margins by responding to changing recycled metals selling prices through adjustments to its metals purchase prices, the Company's ability to do so is limited by competitive factors as well as the impact of lower prices on the volume of scrap available to the Company. Moreover, increases in recycled metals prices can adversely affect the operating results of the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business because increases in steel prices generally lag increases in ferrous recycled metals prices.            The steel industry is also highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. Future economic downturns or a stagnant economy may adversely affect the performance of the Company.            The Company expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and net income. Revenues can fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter due to factors such as the seasonal slowdown in the construction industry, which is an important buyer of the Company's finished steel products. The timing and extent of the slowdown is also dependent on the weather.            The Company makes a number of large ferrous recycled metals shipments to foreign steel producers each year. Customer requirements, shipping schedules and other factors limit the Company's control over the timing of these shipments. Variations in the number of foreign shipments from quarter to quarter will result in fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings. The Company's expectations regarding ferrous metal sales prices and volumes, as well as earnings, are based in part on the assumption that orders from customers for larger shipments are not cancelled or delayed.            Competition:     The recycled metals industry is highly competitive, with the volume of purchases and sales subject to a number of competitive factors, principally price. The Company has competition from both large and numerous smaller companies in its markets for the purchase of recyclable metals. The Company competes with a number of domestic and foreign recycled metals processors for sales to foreign customers.             The domestic steel industry also is highly competitive. Steel prices can be highly volatile and price is a significant competitive factor. The Company competes with several steel producers in the Western United States for sales of its products. In addition, in recent years, the Company has experienced significant foreign competition, which is often subsidized by large government agencies. There can be no assurance that such competition will not increase in the future. In March and April 2002, the ITC imposed tariffs on imported steel, under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act, to aid the domestic steel industry. To date, those tariffs have not significantly benefited selling prices for finished steel products. In October 2002, the ITC announced duty margins of up to 360% and subsidy rate of up to 18% against wire rod products from eight foreign countries. The Company cannot, however, predict the impact of these duty margins and subsidy rates on prices and operating results.            Joint Ventures:     The Company has significant investments in joint venture companies. The Company does not manage the day-to-day activities of these businesses. As a result, it does not have the same ability to control the operations and related financial results as it does with its wholly-owned businesses. These businesses are, however, affected by many of the same risk factors mentioned above. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the financial results of these businesses.             Energy Supply:     The Company and its joint ventures utilize various energy sources to operate their facilities. In particular, electricity and natural gas currently represent approximately 10% of the cost of    36           steel manufactured for the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business. The Steel Manufacturing Business purchases electric power under long-term contracts from government sources which rely on the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). Historically, these contracts have had favorable prices and are long-term in nature. The Company has a five-year contract that expires in September 2006. On October 1, 2001, the BPA increased its electricity rates due to increased demand on the West Coast and lower supplies. This increase was in the form of a Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause (CRAC) added to BPA's contract with McMinnville. The CRAC is an additional monthly surcharge on selected power charges to recover costs associated with buying higher priced power during the West Coast power shortage. The CRAC, which BPA can adjust every six months, was 46% at October 1, 2001, and then reduced to 39% at April 1, 2002 and 32% at October 1, 2002. However, it is not possible to predict future rate changes.            The Steel Manufacturing Business also has long-term contracts for natural gas. In October 2000, the Company entered into a new contract set to expire on October 31, 2003. The latest contract negotiations resulted in rates that were 30% higher then the previous agreement. As this contract comes to an end, the Company will attempt to negotiate a new long-term contract; however, it is not possible to predict the terms of the contract.            The inability of the Company to negotiate favorable terms of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources could adversely affect the performance of the Company.            Tax Laws:     The Company has been able to reduce its effective tax rate below the federal statutory tax rate for each of the last three years by using a combination of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (NOLs), State of California Enterprise Zone tax credits and Foreign Sales Corporations or Extraterritorial Income Exclusions (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company cannot predict how future tax law changes might affect the Company's effective tax rate.            Shipping and Handling:     Both the Metals Recycling Business and the Steel Manufacturing Business often rely on third parties to handle and transport their products to end users in a timely manner. The cost to transport the products can be affected by circumstances over which the Company has no control such as fuel prices, governmental regulations on transportation, and changes in market rates. Also, the products are handled, at times, by union workers and the Company cannot predict when or if union labor relations could affect the cost or timeliness of shipments.            Insurance:     The cost of the Company's insurance is affected not only by its own loss experience but also by cycles in the insurance market. Though the Company's loss record and relationship with its underwriters is good it cannot predict future events and circumstances which could cause rates to materially change.            One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the Company's forward-looking statements. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. Further, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.    NAME="dm1157_item_7(a)._quantitative_and_qu__ite02620">      ITEM 7(a). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                 The Company has entered into certain market-risk sensitive financial instruments, principally long-term debt. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine the potential impact that market risk exposure may have on the fair values of the company's financial instruments. The Company has assessed the potential risk of loss in fair value from hypothetical changes in interest rates by determining the effect on the present value of the future cash flows related to those market sensitive instruments of such changes. The discount rates used for such present value computations were selected based on market interest rates in effect at August 31, 2002, plus or minus 10%. A 10% change    37           in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would result in an immaterial effect on consolidated earnings or cash flows.             This discussion of market risks necessarily makes forward-looking statements. There can be no assurance that actual changes in market conditions and rates and fair values will not differ materially from those used in the sensitivity and fair value calculations discussed. Factors which may cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: greater than 10% changes in interest rates or changes in income or cash flows requiring significant changes in debt instruments or cash flows associated with them.             At August 31, 2002, the Company held no derivatives.    38       NAME="page_fa1157_1_39">         NAME="fa1157_item_8._financial_statements_and_supplementary_data">      ITEM 8.
