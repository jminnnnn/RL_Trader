ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS   Results of Operations  The results of operations of the Company depend in large part upon demand and prices for scrap metals in world markets and steel products on the U.S. West Coast. Increasing steel demand and prices have led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal 1995 through fiscal 1997. Primarily due to the Asian financial crisis, fiscal 1998 results for Scrap Operations were negatively impacted.  The Company's income from joint ventures for the year ended August 31, 1997 was significantly higher than in prior years due to the acquisition of Proler, effective November 29, 1996. In March 1995, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of MMI. MMI's results of operations have been included in the Company's financial statements since March 17, 1995 and have had a significant impact on the Company's scrap related revenue and income since then.  The following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the Company's Scrap Operations and Steel Operations, and the breakdown of income from operations between Scrap Operations, Steel Operations and Joint Ventures. Additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)  Includes the results of operations of MMI from March 17, 1995, the date of      acquisition, through August 31, 1995.  (3)  In July 1995, the Company sold certain of its Portland nonferrous      operations including a nonferrous business acquired in the MMI transaction,      which resulted in a decline in nonferrous revenues for fiscal 1996.  (4)  Ferrous scrap sales from Scrap Operations to Steel Operations are made at a      negotiated market rate per ton.  (5)  Corporate expense and eliminations consist primarily of unallocated      corporate expense for services that benefit both Scrap Operations and Steel      Operations. Because of this unallocated expense, the income from operations      of each segment does not reflect the income from operations the segment      would have as a stand-alone business.    Fiscal 1998 Compared to Fiscal 1997  Revenues for Scrap Operations decreased, while revenues for Steel Operations increased, resulting in a net decrease in the Company's revenues of $8.6 million to $353.1 million for fiscal 1998 compared to $361.7 million for fiscal 1997. The Company achieved record shipments of finished steel products and produced record tons of billets in fiscal 1998.  Scrap Operations generated revenues of $217.9 million, before intercompany eliminations, compared with $236.4 million in fiscal 1997, representing a decrease of $18.5 million (8%). Ferrous revenues decreased $17.0 million (9%) as the result of a 5% decrease in ferrous tons shipped at lower average selling prices. Sales to the Company's Steel Operations were down slightly. Scrap Operations made 25 ferrous scrap export shipments totaling 720,000 tons in fiscal 1998, compared with 30 shipments totaling 853,000 tons in fiscal 1997, while domestic third-party tonnage increased 37% to 235,000 tons. The average selling price for ferrous scrap declined $5 per ton to $122 with the largest decline occurring in export prices during the second half of 1998.  Steel Operations' revenues increased $7.7 million (4%) to $191.4 million. Higher volumes sold, coupled with an increase in selling prices, contributed to the increase. Average steel selling prices increased $5 per ton to $339, while finished steel tons shipped increased 6,600 tons to 553,000 tons. During fiscal 1998, the Company also sold 16,900 tons of billets, compared with 5,600 tons during 1997.  Cost of Goods Sold. Overall, cost of goods sold decreased $3.6 million (1%) to $311.2 million and increased as a percentage of revenue from 87% in fiscal 1997 to 88% in fiscal 1998. Gross profit decreased $5.1 million (11%) to $41.9 million.                                         22                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   Scrap Operations' cost of goods sold decreased $8.8 million (4%) to $189.1 million as the result of a 5% decrease in ferrous tonnage shipped. Cost of sales per ferrous ton shipped remained unchanged from 1997 to 1998. The average selling price of ferrous scrap also declined, resulting in a decrease in Scrap Operations' gross profit of $9.6 million.  Cost of goods sold for Steel Operations increased $2.7 million (2%) to $178.1 million as the result of increased tonnage shipped. Cost of sales per ton decreased $4 as the result of lower scrap prices and increased plant efficiencies. This decrease, coupled with a $5 per ton increase in the average selling price for finished steel and a 1% increase in tonnage shipped, resulted in a $4.8 million (58%) increase in overall gross profit and a 53% increase in gross profit per ton for finished steel.  Selling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million (6%) in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997 primarily as the result of overhead added due to the Proler acquisition in November 1996.  Income from Joint Ventures. The Company's joint ventures generated $408.6 million of revenues for fiscal 1998 compared with $352.5 million for fiscal 1997. The Joint Ventures in the Scrap Processing Business shipped 2.2 million tons and 2.5 million tons for the same periods, respectively. This decrease was primarily a result of the Asian financial crisis. Income from joint ventures for fiscal 1998 decreased $2.8 million to $4.1 million compared with fiscal 1997. This decrease resulted from operating losses due to the Asian financial crisis as well as a $.4 million charge to income for closure of redundant plant facilities and a $3.1 million charge to state inventory at the lower of cost or market. This was offset by a $2.0 million favorable inventory adjustment recorded as a result of physical inventories. The tons shipped for fiscal 1997 in the discussion above include activity which occurred prior to the Company's acquisition of Proler.  Interest Expense. Interest expense for fiscal 1998 increased $1.8 million because of additional debt required to support joint venture operations and capital expenditures. Average borrowings for fiscal 1998 were $97.6 million compared with $96.1 million for 1997. The average interest rate for fiscal 1998 was 5.8% compared with 5.7% for fiscal 1997.  Gain (Loss) on Sale of Fixed Assets. Results for fiscal 1998 include a $2.2 million charge to reflect the estimated loss which the Company expects to realize upon the sale of its Tacoma shredders, which are being replaced with a state-of-the-art automobile shredder.  Other Income. Other Income decreased $3.6 million during the year ended August 31, 1998 compared with the prior year. Fiscal 1997 included a $3 million gain on settlement of an interest rate agreement which it had entered into for the sole purpose of locking in the interest rate on a planned private placement of debt, which the Company subsequently decided against pursuing.  Income tax provision. The effective tax rate for fiscal 1998 increased to 38% from 34% in fiscal 1997 as a result of lower benefits from the Company's foreign sales corporation and a reduced benefit from state tax credits.   Fiscal 1997 Compared to Fiscal 1996  Revenues for both scrap and steel increased, resulting in an overall increase in the Company's revenues of $22.4 million to $361.7 million for fiscal 1997 compared with fiscal 1996. The Company achieved record shipments of both scrap and finished steel products in fiscal 1997, compared to previous years.                                         23                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   Scrap Operations generated revenues of $236.4 million, before intercompany eliminations, during fiscal 1997 compared with $233.4 million in fiscal 1996, representing an increase of $3.0 million (1%). Ferrous revenues declined, however, despite a 39,000 ton (3%) increase in shipments, due to softer selling prices for scrap. Sales to the Company's Steel Operations increased by 43,000 tons (10%) to 494,000 tons. Although the total number of scrap export shipments were the same as the prior year, foreign scrap tonnage declined slightly, while domestic third party sales tonnage remained relatively the same as the prior year. Average ferrous scrap revenues per ton for the first three quarters of fiscal 1997 were lower than for the same period in the prior year, resulting in a lower average selling price for the year of $127 per ton compared with $146 for fiscal 1996. The Company believes that, due to a temporary build-up in scrap inventories by scrap processors and steel mills caused by a slackening in demand, the average prices for ferrous scrap on the world market declined during this period. The average selling price during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 was higher than for the same period in the prior year. The increase in other sales reflects the acquisition of Proler in November 1996.  Steel Operations' revenues increased $23.7 million (15%) to $183.7 million. Higher volumes sold, offset by lower average selling prices, contributed to the increase. The Company experienced increased tonnage sales in all product categories, due in part to the addition of a new rolling mill in February 1996. Average finished steel selling prices, excluding billets, declined from $336 to $334 per ton, reflecting lower prices for all categories of the Company's primary finished steel products. The expansion of steel-making capacity by the Company's competitors and an influx of finished steel shipments from Mexico into Southern California through the third quarter of fiscal 1997 were predominantly responsible for a decline in average selling prices in the market on the U.S. West Coast. The mix of products sold also changed during fiscal 1997, impacting the average selling prices. With the addition of a new rod block on the Company's newest rolling mill in February 1997, Steel Operations began producing wire rod and coiled reinforcing bar (rebar) products. Sales of these products during fiscal 1997 aggregated 20,400 tons. During fiscal 1997, the Company also sold 5,600 tons of billets. No billets were sold in fiscal 1996.  Cost of Goods Sold. Overall, cost of goods sold increased $24.0 million (8%) to $314.8 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 86% in fiscal 1996 to 87% in fiscal 1997. Gross profit declined $1.7 million (3%) to $46.9 million.  Scrap Operations' cost of goods sold increased $4.0 (2%) million to $197.9 million due to increased tonnage sold. The average cost of goods sold per ton of ferrous scrap declined as the Company managed purchase prices at the scale while selling prices were declining. However, the average selling price of ferrous scrap declined more quickly than the cost of goods sold per ton, resulting in an overall decline in Scrap Operations' gross profit of $1.1 million, despite the increase in tons sold.  Cost of goods sold for Steel Operations increased $24.4 million (16%) to $175.4 million due predominantly to higher tonnage sales. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues increased from 94% to 95% due to the decline in the average selling price. The Company recognized higher depreciation expense in fiscal 1997 compared with fiscal 1996, due to the addition of its new rod mill in February 1996 and rod block in February 1997, increasing cost of goods sold per ton. However, production efficiencies and, in some cases, lower production costs positively impacted cost of goods sold. As a result, the average cost of sales per ton of finished steel products remained virtually unchanged. Steel Operations' gross profit declined $.7 million because of the lower average selling prices, partially offset by the increase in finished steel shipments.  Selling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $2.3 million (12%) in fiscal 1997 compared with fiscal 1996 predominantly as a result of increases to accommodate corporate growth and the Proler acquisition.  Income from Joint Ventures. Income from joint ventures for fiscal 1997 increased $3.6 million due to the Proler acquisition in November 1996. Aggregate income for the Company's other joint ventures declined slightly as large projects which were in process in fiscal 1996 were completed that year.                                         24                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   Interest Expense. Interest expense for fiscal 1997 increased by $1.2 million (32%) because of additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition of Proler. Average borrowings for fiscal 1997 were $96.1 million compared with $72.2 million for fiscal 1996. The average interest rate for fiscal 1997 was 5.7% and for fiscal 1996 was 5.9%.  Other Income. Other income increased $2.9 million during the year ended August 31, 1997 compared with the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 1997, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $3 million upon settlement of an interest rate agreement. The Company initially entered into the agreement for the sole purpose of locking in the interest rate on a planned private placement of debt, which the Company subsequently decided against pursuing. The Company has not and does not intend to enter into speculative hedge arrangements.   Year 2000. The following discussion is provided in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Interpretation of Disclosure of Year 2000 Issues and Consequences by Public Companies, Investment Advisors, Investment Companies, and Municipal Securities Issuers.  In response to Year 2000 compliance issues, the Company has developed a systematic approach that consists of the following three phases: (1) identification and assessment to identify potential Year 2000 issues, (2) modification or replacement of equipment and software, (3) final testing to ensure that all systems are Year 2000 compliant after modifications are installed.  The Company has divided its Year 2000 issues into the following categories: (a) physical hardware and related operating systems at the Corporate Data Processing Facility, (b) business and financial reporting systems at all locations, (c) personal computers and peripheral equipment at all locations, (d) facility and support systems (including communication devices and safety systems) at all locations, (e) manufacturing systems at Cascade Steel Rolling Mills.  The Company has completed the identification and assessment phase for the Corporate Data Processing Facility, the business and financial reporting systems at all locations, the personal computers and peripheral equipment at all locations, and the facility and support systems at a majority of its locations.  The Company currently expects that all Phase 1 activities will be complete by March 1, 1999.  The Company has completed the modification of equipment at the Corporate Data Processing Facility, the business and financial reporting systems at all locations, personal computers at all locations, and expects the remainder of Phase 2 activities to be complete no later than May 31, 1999, except for Steel Operations which is expected to be complete no later than November 30, 1999.  The Company expects to complete Phase 3 activities by no later than May 31, 1999, except for Steel Operations which is expected to be complete no later than November 30, 1999.  Management estimates that the costs for correction of the Year 2000 issues, including any software and hardware upgrades (but excluding replacements that would have occurred even without the Year 2000 issue), and the cost of personnel allocated to this project should not exceed $1,000,000, of which $500,000 is expected to be capital expenditures. Approximately $100,000 has been spent to date. The year 2000 upgrades are being funded through normal operating funds and are expected to account for less than 5% of the Company's Information Technology, maintenance and manufacturing capital budgets. There can be no assurance that the costs and timeframes above will not change as the Company continues its assessments.  The Year 2000 project is a priority project for the Company's IT and Engineering departments. No significant IT or engineering projects are being deferred as a result of the Company's Year 2000 efforts.                                         25                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   The Company is also in the process of assessing the Year 2000 readiness of its "key" vendors using questionnaires and letters. In the event a critical vendor is found to be non-compliant, the Company will develop contingency plans to address the issue.  As the Company is not dependent on any significant customer, and given the nature of the scrap business, no Year 2000 assessment of customers is anticipated.  At the present time, the Company has not expended the resources to develop a contingency plan with respect to year 2000 compliance as the Company believes it will be Year 2000 ready.   Liquidity and Capital Resources  For the year ended August 31, 1998, cash generated by operations was $13.3 million compared to $23.1 million for the same period last year. The decrease in cash generated this year is predominantly due to a decrease in net income and an increase in inventories, off-set by a decrease in accounts receivable.  Capital expenditures and payments for purchase of interest in joint ventures totaled $31.3 million, $58.5 million and $44.6 million for fiscal years 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. Expenditures for fiscal 1997 included the acquisition of Proler for $42.5 million and remaining payments for the new wire rod block completed in February 1997. During fiscal 1996, the Company incurred significant capital outlays related to construction of a new rod and bar mill which was placed into service in February 1996. The Company expects to spend approximately $18 million on capital improvements during fiscal 1999.  As part of its acquisitions of Proler and MMI, the Company assumed environmental liabilities aggregating $28.3 million as of August 31, 1998. The Company expects to require significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of such environmental liabilities.  In June 1997, the company completed a renegotiation of its unsecured revolving credit agreement whereby it increased the facility to $200 million and extended the maturity of the facility to June 2002. During fiscal 1998, the maturity of the facility was extended to June 2003. As of August 31, 1998, the Company also had additional lines of credit available of $75 million, $55 million of which was uncommitted. In the aggregate, the Company had borrowings outstanding under these lines of $130.1 million. The increase in borrowings outstanding under the lines since August 31, 1997 is predominantly due to additional borrowings to support joint venture operations and capital expenditures.  Pursuant to a stock repurchase program announced by the Company in May 1994 and amended in April 1998, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 1.6 million shares of its stock when the market price of the Company's stock is not reflective of management's opinion of an appropriate valuation of the stock. Management believes that repurchasing shares under these conditions enhances shareholder value. As of August 31, 1998, a total of 448,300 shares had been purchased under this program. During fiscal 1998, the Company repurchased 196,000 shares of its stock for a total of $5.1 million.  The Company believes that the current cash balance, internally generated funds and existing credit facilities will provide adequate financing for capital expenditures, working capital, joint ventures, stock repurchases and debt service requirements for the next year. In the longer term, the company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing.                                         26                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   Forward Looking Statements  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. One can identify these forward looking statements through the use of words such as "expect," "believe," and other words which convey a similar meaning. One can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They are likely to address the Company's business strategy, financial projections and results and other global factors affecting the Company's financial prospects. An example of this is the current financial crisis facing certain Asian countries and Year 2000 compliance matters. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: supply and demand conditions; the Company's ability to mitigate the effects of the Asian situation and foreign fiscal policies on its profitability; railroad service difficulties; competitive factors and pricing pressures from national steel companies; imports of foreign steel; availability of scrap supply; fluctuations in scrap prices and seasonality of results. One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the Company's forward looking statements. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. Further, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statement.                                         27                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
