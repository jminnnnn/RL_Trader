ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW - -------- The Company operates in three industry segments. The Company's Metals Recycling Business collects, processes and recycles steel and other metals through its facilities. The Company's Steel Manufacturing Business operates a mini-mill near Portland, Oregon, which melts recycled metal, produces finished steel products and maintains one mill depot in Southern California and one in Central California. The Company's Auto Parts Business purchases used and wrecked automobiles and allows retail customers the opportunity of extracting parts for purchase in its self-service auto parts stores, with 17 located in California, two in Nevada and one store in each of Texas, Utah, Illinois and Indiana. Additionally, the Company is a non-controlling partner in joint ventures that are either in the metals recycling business or are suppliers of unprocessed metals. The Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business sell recycled metals that have been processed at their facilities (Processing) and also buy and sell third parties' processed metals (Brokering).  Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the Auto Parts Business acquisition that occurred on February 14, 2003. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"), "Business Combinations," the acquisition is considered a "step" acquisition due to the fact that the Company had a significant joint venture interest in the acquired business for a number of years. Additionally, since the acquisition occurred during the year, the Company elected to include it in the consolidated results as though it had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2003. Thus, the fiscal 2003 statement of operations, balance sheet and statement of cash flows have been adjusted to consolidate the acquisition as of September 1, 2002. Also, the acquired businesses were consolidated with the Company's previous interest in the business to form a separate reporting segment called the Auto Parts Business. Consolidation accounting requires the Company to adjust its earnings for the ownership interests it did not own during the reporting period. During fiscal 2003, net income was reduced by $1.8 million for minority interests, net of income taxes, representing the share of income attributable to various continuing minority partners of the business. Also, for the                                         26   period from September 1, 2002 through February 14, 2003, net income was reduced by $2.5 million of pre-acquisition interests, net of income taxes, representing the share of income attributable to the former joint venture partner prior to the acquisition. The financial results of the acquired business for periods prior to fiscal 2003 continue to be accounted for using the equity method and are included in the joint venture businesses reporting segment.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES - ------------------------------------------  The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and these differences may be material.  The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost method. The production and accounting process utilized by the Company to record recycled metals inventory quantities relies on significant estimates. The Company relies upon perpetual inventory records that utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based upon historical trends and periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities. Over time, these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced; however, actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of the estimates, the Company not only runs periodic tests, but also performs physical inventories. Physical inventories can normally detect significant variations in volume, but because of variations in product density, holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product, physical inventories will not generally detect smaller variations. To mitigate this risk, the Company adjusts it physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory can more accurately predict the remaining volume.  REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company recognizes revenue when it has a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price, the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer, and collectibility is reasonably assured which is generally upon shipment. Title for both metals and finished steel products transfers upon shipment. For retail sales by the Company's Auto Parts Business, revenues are recognized when customers pay for salvaged vehicle parts or when wholesale products are shipped to the customer location. Substantially all of the Company's ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit, minimizing credit risk. However, domestic ferrous recycled metal sales, nonferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account. Historically, there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues; therefore no provisions are made when the sale is recognized.  BAD DEBT RESERVES The Company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts, notes and advances receivable based on a combination of factors. In cases where management is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, management records a specific allowance against amounts due and reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, the Company maintains a reserve that considers the total receivables outstanding, historical collection rates and economic trends.                                         27   ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS The Company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks. To manage these risks, the Company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants. These consultants and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks. The Company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. The regulatory and government management of these projects is extremely complex, which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation of potential sites. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonable established, and no other amount within the range is better than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded in the financial statements. Adjustments to the liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to remediate. In a number of cases, it is possible the Company may receive reimbursement through prior insurance. In these situations, recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is accomplished.  TAXES Deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Periodically, the Company reviews the deferred tax assets to assess whether the valuation allowances continue to be necessary. The valuation allowances will be reversed when there is significant evidence that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES  Effective June 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," under which goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. The Company reviews its goodwill and non-amortizable intangibles on an annual basis for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company amortized goodwill and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ---------------------  During fiscal 2003, the Company's operations improved dramatically, resulting in a record year for revenue and net income. Both the Company's Metals Recycling Business and Steel Manufacturing Business recognized marked improvements over last year. As well, the Company's Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business benefited from rising selling prices to improve their profitability by nearly 80%. Also, as explained further below, the Company acquired a new business segment, the Auto Parts Business, in fiscal 2003. This segment significantly contributed to earnings during the year.  The results of operations of the Company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the Western United States. For example, increasing steel demand and prices led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal 1995 through fiscal 1997. However, during fiscal 1998 and 1999, the Asian financial crisis severely curtailed demand and decreased prices, causing a negative impact on the results of the Metal Recycling Business. During fiscal 2000, the Company saw demand for recycled metal rise, but unusually large supplies of recycled ferrous metal became available from certain countries that were part of the former Soviet Union, thereby holding prices down. In addition, domestic demand for finished steel products was strong, but lower cost imports, primarily from Asia, caused average prices to generally decline. In fiscal 2001, the demand for recycled metals declined in the United States as domestic steel production declined; however, demand in Asia, particularly in China, remained firm. Selling prices also continued to be adversely affected by supplies coming out of the former Soviet Union                                         28   and during the first six months of fiscal 2002, recycled metals prices approached record lows due primarily to this surplus coupled with weak domestic demand. Domestic demand for finished steel products declined due to the slowing United States economy and competition from lower cost imports. The result was a record low average net selling price for the Steel Manufacturing Business during fiscal 2002.  During the second half of fiscal 2002, certain countries of the former Soviet Union started imposing export tariffs and bans on recycled ferrous metal. As a result, recycled ferrous metal supplies to global markets declined causing prices to increase. Many of the Company's customers postponed purchases during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 believing that these delays would cause prices to decline. However, demand, which is being fueled primarily by China and Korea, continued to remain strong and the Company continues to experience improved market conditions. Throughout much of the remainder of fiscal 2003, selling prices continued to rise primarily due to the tight supply of ferrous metal available in the export market and the weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies.  The Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business were affected by the same supply and demand factors as the Company's wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business.  The Steel Manufacturing Business saw higher average selling prices and higher sales volumes during fiscal 2003 due primarily to a higher valued product sales mix and lower volumes of competing imported steel, which is partially attributed to the weakness of the U.S. dollar. Additionally, during the spring of 2002, the U.S. Government imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on certain wire rod imports from eight foreign countries, which combined with higher worldwide ferrous recycled metals prices (the primary raw material used to produce much of the world's wire rod), improved the competitive position of domestic wire rod producers. The Steel Manufacturing Business turned this price parity with imported wire products into increased sales and market share. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Steel Manufacturing Business completed two capital projects to one of the rolling mills, which now allow it to produce higher margin specialty wire products, to improve the packaging of coiled products and increase the productivity on all wire production.  The Auto Parts Business segment was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of the acquisition referred to in the "Overview" section. It purchases salvaged vehicles, sells parts from those vehicles through its retail facilities and wholesale operations and sells the remaining portion of the vehicles to metal recyclers. The retail operations are somewhat seasonal and principally affected by weather conditions and promotional events. Since the stores are open to the natural elements, during periods of prolonged wet, cold or extreme heat, the retail business tends to slow down due to the difficult customer working conditions. Further, the Company generally runs promotional events during seasonably moderate times of the year when it is most likely to affect the buying patterns of its retail customers. As a result, the Company's first and third fiscal quarters tend to generate the most retail sales and the second and fourth fiscal quarters are the slowest in terms of retail sales. The Auto Parts Business' other primary source of revenue is the sale of scrap metal and other parts wholesale. Revenues for the wholesale product lines are principally affected by commodity prices and shipping schedules. As mentioned earlier in the discussions regarding the Metal Recycling Business, recycled metal prices have increased dramatically since the second quarter of fiscal 2002, which has positively affected the revenues and profits of the Auto Parts Business.  The following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the Company's Metals Recycling Business, Steel Manufacturing Business and Auto Parts Business, and the breakdown of income from operations between the Metals Recycling Business, the Steel Manufacturing Business, the Auto Parts Business, Joint Ventures, Corporate and eliminations. Additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                         29                                                              Revenues                                                     Year Ended August 31,                                                     ---------------------                                                         (In millions)                                               2003           2002         2001                                               ----           ----         ---- Metals Recycling Business:      Ferrous                                $ 255.3       $ 173.5       $ 155.6      Nonferrous                                47.8          41.7          43.0      Other                                      5.5           6.6           6.5                                             -------       -------       -------      Recycled metals total                    308.6         221.8         205.1  Auto Parts Business                            65.2          --            -- Steel Manufacturing Business                  191.9         166.6         167.6 Intercompany sales eliminations(1)            (68.8)        (37.8)        (49.9)                                             -------       -------       -------      Total                                  $ 496.9       $ 350.6       $ 322.8                                             =======       =======       =======                                                  Income (Loss) from Operations                                                     Year Ended August 31,                                                     ---------------------                                                         (In millions)                                               2003          2002          2001                                               ----          ----          ----  Metals Recycling Business                   $  35.8       $  11.5(4)    $   8.4 Auto Parts Business                            22.0          --            -- Steel Manufacturing Business                   (2.5)         (5.7)          4.9 JVs in the Metals Recycling Business(2)        24.8          13.8           6.5 JV Suppliers of Metals                         (0.4)          5.6           3.3 Corporate expense (3)                         (10.0)         (8.1)         (7.9) Intercompany eliminations(1)                    1.2          (0.2)         (0.1) Impairment and other nonrecurring charges      (2.1)(4)      (7.1)(4)      --                                             -------       -------       -------      Income  from operations                $  68.8       $   9.8       $  15.1                                             =======       =======       =======  (1)  Ferrous recycled metal sales from the Metals Recycling Business to the      Steel Manufacturing Business, and auto body sales from the Auto Parts      Business to the Metals Recycling Business, are made at negotiated rates per      ton that are intended to approximate market. Consequently, these      intercompany sales tend to produce intercompany profits, which are      eliminated until the finished products are ultimately sold to third      parties.

(3)  Corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expense for      services that benefit all three business segments. Because of this      unallocated expense, the income from operations of each segment does not      reflect the income from operations the segment would have as a stand-alone      business.  (4)  Impairment and other nonrecurring charges related to the Metals Recycling      Business in fiscal 2002 and to the Auto Parts Business in fiscal 2003. The      amounts are shown separately to assist in understanding the business'      financial results.  FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002 - -----------------------------------  REVENUES. Consolidated revenues increased $146.2 million (42%) to $496.9 million for fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. Revenues for the Metals Recycling Business increased due to higher selling prices and volumes as worldwide demand for ferrous metals strengthened through the year. Revenues for the Steel Manufacturing Business                                         30   also increased due to higher average net selling prices and increased sales volumes. Consolidated revenues also increased by $65.2 million due to the addition of the Auto Parts Business as a consolidated business.  The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $308.6 million, before intercompany eliminations, which is an increase of $86.7 million (39%). Ferrous revenues increased $81.8 million (47%) to $255.3 million as a result of an increase in tons sold and higher average selling prices net of shipping cost (average net selling prices). Ferrous sales volumes increased 255,000 tons (16%) and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased $28 (30%) to $122 per ton. Curtailed supplies of ferrous recycled metals from the countries of the former Soviet Union, growing worldwide demand and the weakness of the U.S. dollar drove the volume and price increases. Asia, especially China and Korea, continues to be the primary destination of export sales. In fiscal 2003, the Metals Recycling Business made export shipments aggregating 1.2 million tons, an increase of 89,000 tons (8%) compared with fiscal 2002. Domestic third-party ferrous tonnage also increased by 38,000 tons (46%) to 120,000 tons. Sales to the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business increased 31% to 535,000 tons due to increased demand in this business. Nonferrous revenues increased $6.1 million (15%) to $47.8 million due primarily to higher average prices. The average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal 2003 was $0.42 per pound, an increase of $0.06 per pound from fiscal 2002.  The Steel Manufacturing Business' revenues increased $25.3 (15%) from revenues recognized in the prior year to $191.9 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher average net selling prices and higher volumes for all major product lines. The volume of finished steel products sold increased, along with the average net selling price per ton, compared with fiscal 2002. Sales of finished steel products were up 9% to 622,000 tons while the average net selling price per ton increased $15 per ton (5%) to $291 per ton. The increase in the average sales price per ton was primarily due to a higher valued product sales mix and lower supplies of competing importing steel, which was partially attributed to the weakness of the U.S. dollar. Also, towards the end of the fiscal 2003 second quarter, the Company and other steel producers increased their selling prices for rebar. Additionally, merchant bar selling prices have increased modestly to adjust to the costs of production. The increase in sales volume was due to a 30% increase in the volume of wire rod and a 6% increase in sales volume of rebar. The higher wire rod volume was due to import duties imposed by the U.S. Government in the spring of 2002 on certain wire rod products. The increase in rebar volumes is primarily due to increased demand as wholesale customers bought inventory ahead of the effective date of announced price increases.  As previously mentioned, the Auto Parts Business was acquired on February 14, 2003 and was considered a "step" acquisition allowing the consolidation of its financial results as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. As such, revenues for fiscal 2003 included $65.2 million related to the Auto Parts Business with no comparable revenues being recognized for financial statement purposes in fiscal 2002. In order to aid the reader's understanding of the financial performance of this segment, the pro forma fiscal 2002 revenues for the Auto Parts Business were $58.3 million. The $6.9 million (12%) increase was primarily caused by an increase in wholesale revenues driven by higher average sales prices for scrapped auto bodies due to rising ferrous recycled metal prices. Wholesale prices also benefited from the implementation of a new "core" distribution center that aggregated production volumes and provided an improved venue to sell these products to competing customers. Retail revenues were also up due to growth in part sales and admissions pricing.  COST OF GOODS SOLD. Consolidated cost of goods sold increased $88.6 million (27%) to $413.0 million and was 83% percent of revenues compared with 93% in fiscal 2002. The decrease to 83% was primarily due to improved margins, coming principally from higher selling prices, for all of the Company's business segments.  Cost of goods sold for the Metals Recycling Business increased $56.0 million (28%) to $255.9 million before intercompany eliminations. The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from 90% for fiscal 2002 to 83% during fiscal 2003, contributing to a $30.7 million increase in gross profit. This increase in gross margin in fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to higher selling prices and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher prices paid to suppliers of ferrous recycled metals and higher export freight rates, resulting in an $18 per ton (18%) increase in the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton. Cost of sales per ferrous ton increased as higher selling prices and higher demand for processed metal pushed up the purchase price the Company paid for unprocessed metal. Competition from other recyclers for the purchase of unprocessed metal was also a factor in the cost increases. The average export freight rate climbed $4 per ton in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002.  Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business increased $21.8 million (13%) to $191.0 million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 102% in fiscal 2002 to 100% in fiscal 2003. The decrease was due to a higher average sales price per ton and lowered fixed cost per ton, due to larger production volumes spreading the fixed costs over more tons produced, partially offset by higher prices paid for scrap metal. Melt shop production increased 32% and rolling mill production increased 16% compared with fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 production volumes were temporarily curtailed in order to reduce inventory to better match it with customer demand. Average cost of sales per ton increased $10 per ton (3%) compared with the prior fiscal year. As this increase in cost of sales per ton was more than offset by the $15 per ton increase in average net selling price, gross profit improved by $3.5 million (135%) in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002.                                         31   The Auto Parts Business' cost of sales was $0.5 million (1%) lower during fiscal 2003 as compared to the pro forma cost of sales for fiscal 2002. As a percentage of revenues, cost of sales decreased from 63% to 55%. This improvement was due to higher margins realized on wholesale sales partially offset by higher labor costs.  IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER NONRECURRING CHARGES. In connection with the acquisition of the Auto Parts Business, the Company conducted an environmental due diligence investigation. Based upon new information obtained in this investigation, the Joint Venture accrued $2.1 million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 for remediation costs at the Auto Parts Business's store locations. No environmental proceedings are pending at any of these sites.  The Company recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges of $7.1 million in fiscal 2002. The Company recorded nonrecurring charges of $1.9 million for the early termination of a fixed-price Alaska barge contract of affreightment that management determined was not cost effective. The Alaska barge contract charge included a $0.9 million write-off of a note receivable and a $1.0 million payment to terminate the contract. Also, an impairment charge of $1.8 million was recorded for the elimination of an unprofitable car-crushing business and an impairment charge of $1.1 million was recorded for the closure of an under-performing yard in Reno, Nevada. Nonrecurring charges of $1.5 million were recorded for the loss on the early termination of two vessel charter contracts with a related company. The Company terminated the leases in order to take advantage of market rates which were $7 to $8 per ton lower than the all-in contracted rates. Shipping cost savings as a result of the contract termination totaled approximately $2.0 million. Additionally, a loss of $0.8 million was recorded for the sale of a non-strategic steel forging business.  INCOME FROM JOINT VENTURES. The Company's joint ventures' revenues and results of operations were as follows (in thousands):                                                            Year Ended August 31,                                                           ---------------------                                                             2003         2002                                                             ----         ---- Total revenues from external customers recognized by: Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business:          Processing                                      $ 616,958    $ 480,157          Brokering                                         251,431      144,962 Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                            8,877       61,762                                                          ---------    ---------                                                          $ 877,266    $ 686,881                                                          =========    =========  Income from joint ventures recognized by the Company: Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business          $  24,827    $  13,766 Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                             (406)       5,624                                                          ---------    ---------                                                          $  24,421    $  19,390                                                          =========    =========  The Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals. The increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices. Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures were 3.3 million tons for the year ended August                                         32   31, 2003 compared with 3.5 million tons in the prior year. The volume of ferrous metal brokered by the joint ventures increased to 1.8 million tons in fiscal 2003 compared to 1.2 million tons in the prior year. The average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to $118 per ton from $90 per ton, predominantly due to strong demand from Asia, especially China and Korea. These joint ventures also increased their sales margins by improving operational efficiencies.  In fiscal 2003, the Company's share of income from Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business increased to $24.8 million due to higher average net selling prices, increased margins and more efficient operations. The Company's joint ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation, which earned the majority of the income, instituted EVA concurrently with the Company in fiscal 2001. The use of EVA coupled with management changes has continued to result in improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability. Operating income in fiscal 2003 was reduced by $2.2 million representing the Company's share of the JV LIFO inventory adjustment compared with a reduction of $1.2 million in fiscal 2002.  Revenues of the Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals decreased by $52.9 million from fiscal 2002 as compared to the fiscal 2003. Most of this decrease was caused by the reclassification in fiscal 2003 of the Pick-N-Pull Joint Venture, which is now consolidated and included as a new business segment, the Auto Parts Business. Excluding the change caused by this reclassification, revenues decreased $7.0 million during fiscal 2003 compared to last year due to lower selling prices and lower demolition revenue. The Company's equity in income from these Joint Ventures, excluding the impact of Pick-N-Pull, decreased $1.1 million primarily due to the slowdown in the U.S. economy.  SELLING AND COMMISSION EXPENSES. These expenses increased $2.4 million compared with fiscal 2002 primarily due to an increase in export commission expense caused from higher ferrous recycled metals export sales.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Compared with fiscal 2002, general and administrative expenses increased $6.2 million. The consolidation of the Auto Parts Business represents $5.0 million of this increase. The remainder of this increase is primarily due to increased bonus accruals directly related to the improvement in the Company's EVA performance.  INTEREST EXPENSE. In fiscal 2003, interest expense decreased $0.5 million compared with fiscal 2002 due to lower average interest rates and borrowings. The Company's borrowings averaged $70.5 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $75.9 million in fiscal 2002. The average interest rate for fiscal 2003 was 2.1% compared with 2.7% for fiscal 2002.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES. Other income and expenses decreased $0.7 million in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. The difference is principally due to the addition of the Auto Parts Business and a harbor maintenance tax refund received in fiscal 2002. In addition, this line item includes market value adjustments for changes in investment performance for securities held in a trust for the purpose of funding future non-qualified pension payments. The Company recognized gains from the trust fund assets in the amount of $0.4 million in fiscal 2003 and losses of $0.4 million in fiscal 2002.  INCOME TAX PROVISION. The Company's effective rate of 27% was lower than the 35% federal statutory tax rate for three primary reasons: (1) the implementation of SFAS 142 has eliminated the amortization of goodwill, some of which had been nondeductible; (2) export sales, which under Federal law are taxed at a lower rate than domestic sales, have increased; and (3) net operating loss carryforwards that accompanied an earlier acquisition continue to provide benefit. The prior year's tax rate of 20% benefited from the two latter items, as well as from the one-time recognition of California tax credits that had been generated over the previous ten years.  As part of the 1996 acquisition of Proler International Corp. (Proler), the Company acquired $31.4 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). The Company recognized no immediate tax benefit for the NOLs. Instead, the Company set up an offsetting $31.4 million valuation allowance because the ultimate use of the NOLs were uncertain given the then-current federal tax law proscription against applying the NOLs to any taxable income other than the post-acquisition income generated by Proler. A change to federal tax law in 1999, however, has                                         33   allowed an annual $2.4 million of NOL to be applied to taxable income from all sources, not just from Proler. Due to this change in tax law, the Company released an annual $2.4 million from the valuation allowance, and recognized the corresponding $0.8 million in tax benefit, in fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. This is a major reason why the Company's effective tax rates have been lower than the statutory rates for those years. The remaining balance of unused NOLs, which stands at $15.3 million as of August 31, 2003, will expire in fiscal years 2007 through 2012 if not used by then.  The Company also acquired $0.7 million of credits as part of the Proler acquisition. As with the NOLs, a valuation allowance was set up to offset the credits, the ultimate use of which has been made more likely by the subsequent liberalization of federal tax law. No part of the valuation allowance has yet to be released. The credits are not likely to be used until after the NOLs have been used or expire. The credits can be carried forward indefinitely.  In fiscal 2002, the Company qualified for $2.1 million of Enterprise Zone tax credits in the state of California. These credits can be used to offset California state income taxes to the extent that each corporation in the consolidated group has a California franchise (income) tax liability. Any credits in excess of the tax liability can be carried forward indefinitely. These credits, combined with the release of $2.4 million of valuation allowance pertaining to the NOLs, were major reasons the Company's effective tax rate of 14% for fiscal 2002 was well below the statutory rate of 34%.   FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001 - -----------------------------------  REVENUES. Consolidated revenues increased $27.8 million (9%) to $350.6 million for fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001. Revenues for the Metals Recycling Business increased due to higher selling prices and volumes as worldwide demand for ferrous metals strengthened through the year. Revenues for the Steel Manufacturing Business were slightly lower primarily due to lower average net selling prices partially offset by increased sales volumes.  The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $221.8 million, before intercompany eliminations, an increase of $16.6 million (8%). Ferrous revenues increased $17.9 million (12%) to $173.5 million as a result of an increase in tons sold and higher average selling prices net of shipping cost (average net selling prices). Ferrous volumes increased 75,000 tons (5%) and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased $3 to $94 per ton (3%). Diminished supplies of ferrous recycled metals from the countries of the former Soviet Union and growing worldwide demand drove the volume and price increases. Asia, especially China and Korea, continued to be the primary destination of export sales. In fiscal 2002, the Metals Recycling Business made export shipments aggregating 1,068,000 tons, an increase of 291,000 tons (37%) compared with fiscal 2001. Because of the continued soft United States economy, domestic third-party ferrous tonnage decreased 57,000 ton (41%) to 82,000 tons. Sales to the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business decreased 28% to 407,000 tons due to production curtailments in this business. Nonferrous revenues decreased $1.3 million (3%) to $41.7 million due to a corresponding reduction in sales volume. The average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal 2002 was $0.36 per pound, a decline of $0.01 per pound from fiscal 2001.  The Steel Manufacturing Business recognized revenues of $166.6 million in fiscal 2002, a decrease of 1% from revenues recognized in the prior year. The volume of finished steel products sold increased, but the average net selling price per ton decreased compared with fiscal 2001. Sales of finished steel products were up 4% to 569,000 tons while the average net selling price per ton decreased $16 per ton (5%) to $276 per ton, a record low. The decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to lower average net selling prices for all major product lines which were partially offset by the increase in sales volumes. The decrease in the average sales price per ton was primarily due to the sluggish United States economy and weak end user demand, continuing competition from lower cost steel imports and a shift in product mix from merchant bar to wire rod. The increase in sales volume was due to a 31% greater sales volume of wire rod, which was partially offset by a decline in the sales volume of merchant bar. The higher wire rod volume was due to additional demand by a major customer. Tariffs on selected imported steel products enacted in March and April 2002 by the International Trade Commission (ITC) under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act did not produce any significant price benefits.                                         34   COST OF GOODS SOLD. Consolidated cost of goods increased $33.5 million (11%) to $324.4 million and was 93% percent of revenues compared with 90% in fiscal 2001. The increase to 93% was primarily due to eroded margins for the Steel Manufacturing Business. Gross profit decreased $5.6 million (18%) to $26.2 million.  Cost of goods sold for the Metals Recycling Business increased $18.4 million (10%) to $199.9 million before intercompany eliminations. The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues increased from 88% for fiscal 2001 to 90% during fiscal 2002. Gross profit increased $1.8 million compared with fiscal 2001. This increase in gross margin in fiscal 2002 was primarily attributable to higher selling prices and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher prices paid to suppliers for ferrous recycled metals, resulting in a $5 per ton (5%) increase in the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton. Cost of sales per ferrous ton increased as higher selling prices and higher demand for processed metal pushed up the purchase price the Company paid for unprocessed metal. Lower shipping costs per ton partially offset the purchase price increases. Competition from other recyclers for the purchase of unprocessed metal was also a factor in the cost increases.  Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business increased $9.8 million (6%) to $169.2 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 95% in fiscal 2001 to over 100% in fiscal 2002. The increase was due to higher fixed costs being spread over fewer production tons as mill curtailments that began in August 2001 continued throughout fiscal 2002. Melt shop production fell 29% and rolling mill production fell 11% compared with fiscal 2001. Also, contributing to the increase was a 15% rise in energy costs. Energy cost increased due to the 2001 Western energy shortage which increased contracted power rates. Average cost of sales per ton increased $4 per ton (2%) compared with the prior fiscal year. This increased cost of sales per ton, combined with the $16 per ton reduction in average net selling price, resulted in a decrease in gross profit of $10.8 million (131%) in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001.  IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER NONRECURRING CHARGES. The Company recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges of $7.1 million in fiscal 2002. The Company recorded nonrecurring charges of $1.9 million for the early termination of a fixed-price Alaska barge contract of affreightment that management determined was not cost effective. The Alaska barge contract charge included a $0.9 million write-off of a note receivable and a $1.0 million payment to terminate the contract. Also, an impairment charge of $1.8 million was recorded for the elimination of an unprofitable car-crushing business and an impairment charge of $1.1 million was recorded for the closure of an under-performing yard in Reno, Nevada. The Company now sublets the Reno facility and leases the equipment to a third party that sells its recycled metal output to the Company. Nonrecurring charges of $1.5 million were recorded for the loss on the early termination of two vessel charter contracts with a related company. The Company terminated the leases in order to take advantage of market rates which were $7 to $8 per ton lower than the all-in contracted rates. Shipping cost savings as a result of the contract termination totaled approximately $2.0 million. Additionally, a loss of $0.8 million was recorded for the sale of a non-strategic steel forging business.  A number of the charges were a direct result of the Company's 2001 implementation of Economic Value Added (EVA) which is a tool used to measure financial performance and acceptable returns on investment as well as compensate management on the change in EVA performance. Since implementing EVA, the Company has re-analyzed the business performance and related outlook for many of its assets. The result of these reviews, using the EVA tool, led to many operational and management changes in the Company's business.                                         35   INCOME FROM JOINT VENTURES. The Company's joint ventures' revenues and results of operations were as follows (in thousands):                                                             Year Ended August 31,                                                            ---------------------                                                               2002        2001                                                            ---------   --------- Total revenues from external customers recognized by: Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business:          Processing                                        $ 480,157   $ 447,689          Brokering                                           144,962     108,274 Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                             61,762      53,381                                                            ---------   ---------                                                            $ 686,881   $ 609,344                                                            =========   ========= Income from joint ventures recognized by the Company: Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business            $  13,766   $   6,549 Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                              5,624       3,288                                                            ---------   ---------                                                            $  19,390   $   9,837                                                            =========   =========  The Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals. The increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures was attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices and an increase in tonnage shipped. Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to 3.5 million tons for the year ended August 31, 2002 from 3.1 million tons in the prior year. The average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to $90 per ton from $86 per ton, predominantly due to strong demand from Asia, especially China and Korea. These joint ventures also increased their sales margins by improving operational efficiencies.  In fiscal 2002, the Company's share of income from Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business increased to $13.8 million due to increased sales volume, higher average net selling prices, increased margins and more efficient operations. The Company's joint ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation, which earned the majority of the income, instituted EVA concurrently with the Company in fiscal 2001. The use of EVA has continued to result in improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability. Operating income in fiscal 2002 was reduced by $1.2 million representing the Company's share of the JV LIFO inventory adjustment compared with a benefit of $0.9 million in fiscal 2001. Operating income in fiscal 2002 also benefited by $0.9 million representing the Company's share of a nonrecurring gain on sale of JV property.  Both revenues and income from the Joint Venture Suppliers of Metal increased from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 primarily due to increased sales by the Company's self-service auto dismantling joint venture. Increased sales prices, more efficient operations, and lower interest costs drove the revenue growth and income improvements.   SELLING AND COMMISSION EXPENSES. These expenses increased $0.7 million compared with fiscal 2001 primarily due to an increase in export commission expense caused from higher ferrous recycled metals export sales.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Compared with fiscal 2001, general and administrative expenses increased $1.4 million primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in wages as a result of annual merit increases and bonus accruals related to the Company's EVA performance and a $0.4 million in increased insurance expense due to adverse insurance market conditions since September 11, 2001.  INTEREST EXPENSE. In fiscal 2002, interest expense decreased $2.8 million compared with fiscal 2001 due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates. The Company's borrowings averaged $75.9 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $81.5 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in average borrowings reflected improved cash flow as a result of substantial decreases in inventory during fiscal 2002. The average interest rate for fiscal 2002 was 2.7% compared with 5.8% for fiscal 2001.                                         36   OTHER INCOME. Other income decreased $1.2 million in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001 primarily due to a $1.6 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates charged on variable interest rate advances and notes to joint venture businesses. In addition, this line item includes market value adjustments for changes in investment performance for securities held in a trust for the purpose of funding future non-qualified pension payments. During fiscal 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized losses from the trust fund assets in the amount of $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively.  INCOME TAX PROVISION. As part of the 1996 acquisition of Proler International Corp. (Proler), the Company acquired $31.4 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). Prior to fiscal 2000, federal tax law placed limitations on the source of the income that could be offset by the NOLs. Accordingly, the Company was not able to record the potential tax benefits from the NOLs because of the lack of certainty in being able to realize these benefits. In fiscal 2000, a change in federal tax law allowed the Company to use the NOLs to offset taxable income from all sources, subject to a limit of $2.4 million per year. During fiscal 2001, the Company continued to benefit from the use of $2.4 million of NOLs, which was one of the primary reasons the effective rate was 30% as compared to the statutory rate of 34%.  In fiscal 2002, it was determined that the Company qualified for $2.1 million of Enterprise Zone tax credits in the state of California. These credits can be used to offset California state income taxes to the extent that each corporation in the consolidated group has a California franchise (income) tax liability. Any credits in excess of the tax liability can be carried forward indefinitely. The combination of NOLs and Enterprise Zone tax credits made the Company's effective tax rate 14% for fiscal 2002 as compared with a statutory rate of 34%.  As noted above, Federal income tax law limits the Company's use of NOLs to $2.4 million per year. Unused NOLs may be carried forward and used in subsequent fiscal years, though they will ultimately expire in fiscal years 2007 through 2012, if not used by then. Subject to the annual limit, there remains at August 31, 2002 $17.7 million of Proler NOLs that may be used in future years before they expire.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  For fiscal 2003, cash generated by operations was $40.9 million, compared to $36.4 million last year. The increase in cash flow provided by operations was primarily the result of improved operating profits. In fiscal 2002, inventories declined $31.2 million, generating cash flow of this amount.  Capital expenditures totaled $21.8 million, $9.6 million, and $9.3 million for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase was due primarily to costs associated with dock renovation and improvement projects at the Company's Portland, Oregon and Oakland, California recycling facilities.  As a result of acquisitions completed in both the current and prior years, the Company had environmental liabilities that aggregated $21.8 million as of August 31, 2003. The Company expects significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of such environmental liabilities.  On May 30, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to refinance its revolving bank credit facility. The new facility is unsecured, matures in May 2006, and provides for up to $150 million of credit availability. The facility's interest rates vary. The Company also has an additional unsecured line of credit of $20 million, which is uncommitted. The Company's debt agreements have certain restrictive covenants. As of August 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with such covenants and had aggregate bank borrowings outstanding of $79 million.  In July 2002, the Company's metals recycling joint ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation entered into a $70 million revolving credit facility ("JV Credit Facility") with a group of banks for working capital and general credit purposes. Prior to that time, the joint ventures' working capital and other cash needs had been met by advances provided equally by the Company and Hugo Neu Corporation. The JV Credit Facility expires in July 2004 and is secured by                                         37   the inventory and receivables of the joint venture businesses. The Company is not a guarantor of the JV Credit Facility. The JV Credit Facility has a number of covenants and restrictions, including restrictions on the level of distributions to the joint venture partners. As of August 31, 2003, the joint ventures were in compliance with such covenants. Borrowings under the JV Credit Facility totaled $30 million at August 31, 2003.  Because the interest rates under the JV Credit Facility are higher than those obtained by the Company, management generally considers it prudent for the joint ventures to reduce the facility balance before remitting cash to the joint venture partners. The joint venture agreements allow for distributions to the joint venture partners. No such distributions were declared for fiscal 2003. Instead, cash flow from operations was primarily used to fund working capital and capital expenditures. As such, cash received from joint ventures in fiscal 2003 was lower than in fiscal 2002.  The Company has certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments to make future payments. The following table summarizes these future obligations and commitments as of August 31, 2003 (in thousands):                                         Less than      1-3       4-5      After 5                                Total     1 Year      Years     Years      Years                              --------   --------   --------   -------   -------- Long-term debt(1)            $ 87,265   $    220   $ 79,315   $    30   $  7,700 Operating leases(2)           130,018      7,021     11,555     7,520    103,922 Letters of Credit               1,993      1,993 JV Credit Facility (50%)(3)    15,000     15,000                              --------   --------   --------   -------   -------- Total                        $234,276   $ 24,234   $ 90,870   $ 7,550   $111,622                              ========   ========   ========   =======   ========  (1)  The Company has a $150 million credit facility with a group of banks for      working capital and other general purposes. The facility expires in May      2006.  (2)  The Company's operating leases increased by $14.7 million as a result of      the acquisition of the Auto Parts Business.  (3)  This disclosure assumes that if the JV Credit Facility is not renewed or      refinanced upon expiration, the Company and Hugo Neu Corporation would      restore their previous arrangement under which each funded one-half of the      joint ventures' cash needs.  Pursuant to a stock repurchase program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 3 million shares of its stock when the market price of the Company's stock is not reflective of management's opinion of an appropriate valuation of the stock. Management believes that repurchasing shares under these conditions enhances shareholder value and helps the Company manage its targeted capital structure. During fiscal 2003, the Company made no share repurchases. As of August 31, 2003, a total of 1.3 million shares had been purchased under this program.  The Company believes that the current cash balance, internally generated funds and existing credit facilities will provide adequate financing for capital expenditures, working capital, joint ventures, stock repurchases, debt service requirements and future environmental obligations for the next year. In the longer term, the Company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing.  FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. This Form 10-K, including Item 1 of Part 1and Items 7 and 7(a) of Part II, contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934, that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. One can generally identify these forward-looking statements because they contain "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "plans," and other words which convey a similar meaning. One can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Examples of factors affecting Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.'s wholly-owned operations and its joint ventures (the Company) that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following:                                         38   Cyclicality and General Market Considerations: Selling prices for recycled metals are highly cyclical in nature and subject to worldwide economic conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of recycled metals are subject to volatile supply and demand conditions beyond the Company's control, resulting in periodic fluctuations in recycled metals prices. While the Company attempts to maintain margins by responding to changing recycled metals selling prices through adjustments to its metals purchase prices, the Company's ability to do so is limited by competitive factors as well as the impact of lower prices on the volume of recycled metal available to the Company. Moreover, increases in recycled metals prices can adversely affect the operating results of the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business because increases in steel prices generally lag increases in ferrous recycled metals prices.  The steel industry is also highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. Future economic downturns or a stagnant economy may adversely affect the performance of the Company.  The Company expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and net income. Revenues can fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter due to factors such as the seasonal slowdown in the construction industry, which is an important buyer of the Company's finished steel products. The timing and extent of the slowdown is also dependent on the weather.  Another factor which may affect revenues relates to the seasonal reduction in demand from foreign customers who tend to reduce their finished steel production during the summer months to offset higher energy costs. Also, severe weather conditions may affect the Company's global market conditions.  The Company makes a number of large ferrous recycled metals shipments to foreign steel producers each year. Customer requirements, shipping schedules and other factors limit the Company's control over the timing of these shipments. Variations in the number of foreign shipments from quarter to quarter will result in fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings. The Company's expectations regarding ferrous metal sales prices and volumes, as well as earnings, are based in part on a number of assumptions (for example, uncertainties relating to customer orders, metal availability, estimated freight rates, cost and volume of inventory yet to be processed, and production output, etc.).  The Auto Parts Business experiences modest seasonal fluctuations in demand. The retail stores are open to the elements. During periods of extreme temperatures and precipitation, customers tend to delay their purchases and wait for milder conditions. As a result, retail sales are generally higher during the spring and fall of each fiscal year and lower in the winter and summer months.  Competition: The recycled metals industry is highly competitive, with the volume of purchases and sales subject to a number of competitive factors, principally price. The Company has competition from both large and numerous smaller companies in its markets for the purchase of recyclable metals. The Company competes with a number of domestic and foreign recycled metals processors for sales to foreign customers. In the recent past, lower cost ferrous recycled metals supplies from the countries of the former Soviet Union have adversely affected the Company's ferrous recycled metals selling prices and volumes. Currently, those countries have export tariffs and some outright export bans which have significantly reduced their export volumes and lowered the worldwide supply of ferrous recycled metals These tariffs and bans have had a positive effect on the Company's selling prices and volumes. However, the Company cannot predict when or if the countries of the former Soviet Union will change their export policies and what effect, if any, such changes might have on the Company's operating results.  The domestic steel industry also is highly competitive. Steel prices can be highly volatile and price is a significant competitive factor. The Company competes with several steel producers in the Western United States for sales of its products. In recent years, the Company has experienced significant foreign competition, which is sometimes subsidized by large government agencies. There can be no assurance that such competition will not increase in the future. In March and April 2002, the ITC imposed tariffs on imported steel, under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act, to temporarily aid the domestic steel industry. In 2003, these tariffs were found to be in violation of global trade rules by a World Trade Organization ("WTO") dispute panel. The WTO has not issued a final report and it is expected that the U.S. Government would appeal the decision. To date, however, those tariffs have not significantly benefited selling prices for finished steel products on the West Coast of the United States. In the spring of 2002, the                                         39   U.S. Government imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties against wire rod products from eight foreign countries. These duties have assisted the Company in increasing sales of wire rod products; any expiration or termination of the duties could have a corresponding adverse effect. In December 2002, Nucor Corporation assumed ownership of the assets of Birmingham Steel Corp., a steel manufacturing business in Seattle, Washington. Nucor Corporation, the leader in setting prices in the Company's markets, has a significant share of the West Coast finished steel market and is considered an aggressive competitor. The long term impact, if any, that Nucor's ownership and operation of Birmingham Steel's Seattle facility will have on the Steel Manufacturing Business' and the Metals Recycling Business' operating results cannot be determined at this time. Additionally, until recently the Steel Manufacturing Business also competed with the North Star mill in Kingman, Arizona, which was sold to Nucor. That facility is currently idle, but any future start-up of its operations could impact the Company's market.  Joint Ventures: The Company has significant investments in joint venture companies. The Company does not manage the day-to-day activities of these businesses. As a result, it does not have the same ability to control the operations and related financial results as it does with its consolidated businesses. These businesses are, however, affected by many of the same risk factors mentioned above. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the financial results of these businesses. Additionally, two of these joint ventures continue to use LIFO inventory accounting, which tends to defer income taxes. Historically, the effects of LIFO adjustments are difficult to predict.  Energy Supply: The Company and its joint ventures utilize various energy sources to operate their facilities. In particular, electricity and natural gas currently represent approximately 10% of the cost of steel manufactured for the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business. The Steel Manufacturing Business purchases electric power under a long-term contract from McMinnville Water & Light (McMinnville) which in turn relies on the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). Historically, these contracts have had favorable prices and are long-term in nature. The Company has a five-year contract that expires in September 2006. On October 1, 2001, the BPA increased its electricity rates due to increased demand on the West Coast and lower supplies. This increase was in the form of a Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause (CRAC) added to BPA's contract with McMinnville. The CRAC is an additional monthly surcharge on selected power charges to recover costs associated with buying higher priced power during the West Coast power shortage. Because the BPA can adjust the CRAC every six months, it is not possible to predict future rate changes.  The Steel Manufacturing Business also has a contract for natural gas. The current contract expires on October 31, 2003 and a new contract has been signed which expires October 31, 2004. The new contract price has increased by 15%.  If the Company is unable to negotiate favorable terms of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources, this could adversely affect the performance of the Company.  Tax Laws: The Company has been able to reduce its effective tax rate below the federal statutory tax rate for each of the last three years by using a combination of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (NOLs), State of California Enterprise Zone tax credits and Foreign Sales Corporations or Extraterritorial Income Exclusions. The Company cannot predict how future tax law changes might affect the Company's effective tax rate.  Currency Fluctuations: Demand from the Company's foreign customers is partially driven by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Recent weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies has been a significant factor in the increases in recycled metals prices over the last year, as well as resulted in increasing the cost of certain finished steel imports. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the competitiveness of the Company's products in the markets in which the Company competes. The Company has no control over such fluctuations and, as such, these dynamics could affect the Company's revenues and earnings.  Shipping and Handling: Both the Metals Recycling Business and the Steel Manufacturing Business often rely on third parties to handle and transport their products to end users in a timely manner. The cost to transport the products, in particular by ocean freight, can be affected by circumstances over which the Company has no control such as fuel prices, political events, governmental regulations on transportation and changes in market rates due to carrier availability.                                         40   Insurance: The cost of the Company's insurance is affected not only by its own loss experience but also by cycles in the insurance market. The Company cannot predict future events and circumstances which could cause rates to materially change such as war, terrorist activities or natural disasters.  Auto Parts Business: The Auto Parts Business competes with both full-service and self-service auto dismantlers as well as larger well financed retail auto parts businesses for retail customers. Periodically, the Auto Parts Business increases prices, which may affect customer flow and buying patterns. The ultimate impact of these changes cannot be predicted. Also, the business competes for its automobile inventory with other dismantlers, used car dealers, auto auctions and metal recyclers. Inventory costs can fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions and prices for recycled metal.  The Auto Parts Business is subject to a number of other risks that could prevent it from maintaining or exceeding its current levels of profitability, such as volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for its products, services and raw materials; environmental issues; local and worldwide economic conditions; increased competition; and business integration and management transition issues.  One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the Company's forward-looking statements. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. Further, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates. Because such derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent incremental risk to the Company. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Note 1 of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements".                                                       41   ITEM 8.
