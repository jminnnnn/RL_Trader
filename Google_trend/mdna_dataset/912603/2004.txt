ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW - --------  The Company operates in three industry segments. The Company's Metals Recycling Business collects, processes and recycles steel and other metals through its facilities. The Company's Steel Manufacturing Business operates a mini-mill near Portland, Oregon, which melts recycled metal, produces finished steel products and maintains one mill depot in Southern California and one in Central California. The Company's Auto Parts Business purchases used and wrecked automobiles and allows retail customers the opportunity of extracting parts for purchase in its self-service auto parts stores, with 17 located in California, three in Canada, two in Nevada and one store in each of Texas, Utah, Illinois and Indiana. Additionally, the Company is a non-controlling partner in joint ventures that are either in the metals recycling business or are suppliers of unprocessed metals. These joint ventures in the metals recycling business sell recycled metals that have been processed at their facilities (Processing) and also buy and sell third parties' processed metals (Brokering).                                         23                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES - ------------------------------------------  The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and these differences may be material.  The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:  INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost method. The production and accounting process utilized by the Company to record recycled metals inventory quantities relies on significant estimates. The Company relies upon perpetual inventory records that utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based upon historical trends and periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities. Over time, these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced; however, actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of the estimates, the Company not only runs periodic tests, but also performs monthly physical inventories. Physical inventories may detect significant variations in volume, but because of variations in product density, holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product, physical inventories will not generally detect smaller variations. To mitigate this risk, the Company adjusts it physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory can more accurately predict the remaining volume. In addition, the Company establishes inventory reserves to further mitigate the risk of significant adjustments when determined reasonable.  REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company recognizes revenue when it has a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price, the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer and collectibility is reasonably assured. Title for both metals and finished steel products transfers upon shipment based on either C.I.F. or F.O.B. terms. For retail sales by the Company's Auto Parts Business, revenues are recognized when customers pay for salvaged vehicle parts or when wholesale products are shipped to the customer location.  ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS The Company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks. To manage these risks, the Company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants. These consultants and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks. The Company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. The regulatory and government management of these projects is extremely complex, which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation of potential sites. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established, and no other amount within the range is better than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded in the financial statements. Adjustments to the liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to remediate. In a number of cases, it is possible the Company may receive reimbursement through prior insurance or from other potentially responsible parties identified in a claim. In these situations, recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as an asset when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable and reasonably estimable.                                         24                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  GOODWILL In assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded. We have adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and are required to assess goodwill for impairment at a minimum annually, using a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit. The first step is a screen for impairment and the second step measures the amount of any impairment. These tests utilize fair value amounts that are determined by estimated future cash flows developed by management.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS We are required to assess potential impairments of long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for Impairment of Long-lived Assets, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based upon the most recent information available. Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management. The Company's long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment used in operations.  TAXES Deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Periodically, the Company reviews the deferred tax assets to assess whether the valuation allowances are necessary.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ---------------------  During fiscal 2004, the Company's operations improved dramatically, resulting in a record year for revenue and net income. Both the Company's Metals Recycling Business and Steel Manufacturing Business recognized marked improvements over last year. As well, the Company's Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business benefited from rising selling prices to improve their profitability by 148%. In addition, the Auto Parts Business contributed to earnings growth during the year.  The results of operations of the Company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the Western United States. In fiscal 2004, strong worldwide demand and a limited supply of recycled metals drove the Metals Recycling Business' average selling prices to all time highs. Market prices for recycled ferrous metals fluctuate periodically and have a significant impact on the results of operations for the wholly-owned and Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business.  The Steel Manufacturing Business saw significantly higher average selling prices and slightly higher sales volumes during fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. Sales prices and volumes benefited from strong demand for steel products on the west coast of the United States, improvements in the U.S. economy, and lower steel imports, which is partially attributed to the weakness of the U.S. dollar and higher ocean freight rates.  The Auto Parts Business segment was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 as the result of an acquisition. It purchases salvaged vehicles, sells parts from those vehicles through its retail facilities and wholesale operations and sells the remaining portion of the vehicles to metal recyclers. The retail operations are somewhat seasonal and principally affected by weather conditions and promotional events. Since the stores are open to the natural elements, during periods of prolonged wet, cold or extreme heat, the retail business tends to slow down due to the difficult customer working conditions. As a result, the Company's first and third fiscal quarters tend to generate the most retail sales and the second and fourth fiscal quarters are the slowest in terms of retail sales. The Auto Parts Business' other primary source of revenue is the sale of scrap metal and other parts wholesale. Revenues for the wholesale product lines are principally affected by commodity prices and shipping schedules. As mentioned earlier in the discussions regarding the Metal                                         25                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  Recycling Business, recycled metal prices have increased dramatically over fiscal 2003 which positively affected the revenues and profits of the Auto Parts Business. In addition, the Auto Parts Business completed an acquisition during fiscal 2004 which added three stores in Canada to the original 23 stores acquired in fiscal 2003.  The following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the Company's Metals Recycling Business, Steel Manufacturing Business and Auto Parts Business, and the breakdown of operating income from the Metals Recycling Business, the Steel Manufacturing Business, the Auto Parts Business, Joint Ventures, Corporate and eliminations.

FORM 10-K  FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 - -----------------------------------  REVENUES. Consolidated revenues increased $191.4 million (39%) to $688.2 million for fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. Revenues in fiscal 2004 increased for all Company businesses primarily as a result of increased prices and demand in the worldwide ferrous metals market, including the addition of new export customers located outside of China. Significant improvements in demand coupled with lower steel imports led to increases in selling prices for finished steel products sold by the Steel Manufacturing Business. The Auto Parts Business benefited from the increased ferrous metals prices in its sales of autobodies. In addition, the Auto Parts Business acquired three retail locations in Canada that added revenue and operating income to the segment.               METALS RECYCLING BUSINESS The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $456.3 million, before intercompany eliminations, which is an increase of $147.7 million (48%). Ferrous revenues increased $137.8 million (54%) to $393.0 million as a result of higher average selling prices net of shipping cost (average net selling prices), higher shipping costs billed to customers and a slight increase in the volume sold. The average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased $62 per ton, or 51%, to $184 per ton which represents $111.8 million of the revenue increase. Average export shipping costs increased 57% over the prior year and represent $19.9 million of the revenue increase. In addition, ferrous sales volumes increased 1.8% or 33,000 tons which represents $4.1 million of the increase in ferrous revenue. Export volume is up 1.1% over prior year. Moreover, over 60% of our total ferrous sales were export shipments to Asia in the last two fiscal years. In fiscal 2004, ferrous export sales to China decreased to 34% of the total ferrous exports compared to more than 60% in fiscal 2003. In addition, ferrous export sales to South Korea increased to approximately 53% of our total ferrous export sales in fiscal 2004 compared to 28% of ferrous export sales in fiscal 2003. New customers in Thailand and India purchased 10% of our export sales volume in fiscal 2004.  Sales volume to the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business increased 15% to 618,000 tons due to increased demand in this finished steel business. Nonferrous revenues increased $9.2 million (19%) to $57.0 million due primarily to higher average prices. The average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal 2004 was $0.48 per pound, an increase of $0.06 per pound from fiscal 2003.              AUTO PARTS BUSINESS The Auto Parts Business generated revenue of $81.5 million, before intercompany eliminations, which is an increase of $16.3 million or 25% from prior year. This increase is a result of higher wholesale revenues driven by higher average sales prices for scrapped autobodies due to rising ferrous recycled metal prices and the March 2004 acquisition of three retail store locations in Canada.              STEEL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS The Steel Manufacturing Business' generated revenues of $271.3 million, which is an increase of $79.4 million or 41% from prior year. Sales prices increased $113 per ton or 39% which represents $70.7 million of the increase and sales volumes increased 3% which represents $5.9 million of the revenue increase. The increase in selling prices are a combination of increased demand and passing along rapidly rising raw materials and energy costs required in the production process.  COST OF GOODS SOLD. Consolidated cost of goods sold increased $117.2 million or 28% over the prior year. Cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of revenue from 83% in fiscal 2003 to 77% in fiscal 2004. The reduction in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is due to profit margin improvements at all of the Company's business segments, led by the Steel Manufacturing Business.              METALS RECYCLING BUSINESS Cost of goods sold for the Metal Recycling Business increased $102.0 million or 40% to $357.9 million. The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from 83% in fiscal 2003 to 78% in fiscal 2004. Gross profit increased by $45.7 million to $98.4 million for the year. The increase in gross profit was attributable to higher average net selling prices per ton. Compared with fiscal 2003, the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton                                         27                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  increased 37% due primarily to higher purchase costs for unprocessed ferrous metals and higher export sales shipping costs. Generally, the change in the cost of unprocessed metal has a strong correlation to changes in the average selling price; however there is generally a delay in the timing between changes in net selling prices and the change in the cost of unprocessed metal. Thus, as selling prices rose compared with last year, so did the cost of unprocessed metal. Since purchase costs did not increase at the same rate as selling prices, we experienced significant increases in margins.               AUTO PARTS BUSINESS The Auto Parts Business' cost of goods sold increased $10.2 million or 28% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 55% to 57%. This increase was due to higher car purchase costs and increases in labor costs. Gross profit increased $6.1 million or 21% over the prior year due to increased revenue.              STEEL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS  Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business increased $51.5 million or 27% to $242.5 million. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2004 decreased to 89% from 100% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is attributable to higher average selling prices, higher sales volumes and the receipt of the final $1.8 million electrode price fixing settlement, offset by a $1.1 million pension charge. Average cost of goods sold per ton increased $69 per ton or 24% compared to the prior fiscal year. As this increase in cost of sales per ton was more than offset by the $114 per ton increase in average net selling price, gross profit improved by $27.9 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003.  IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER NONRECURRING CHARGES. During fiscal 2002, the Company's Portland, Oregon metals recycling facility embarked on a dock and loading facility renovation. The renovation was suspended in fiscal 2003 when issues with the dock's substructure were detected. Upon review of new engineering designs focused on operational efficiency and safety specifications, an impairment charge of $3.5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to write-off renovation costs incurred prior to the suspension.  In connection with the acquisition of the Auto Parts Business, the Company conducted an environmental due diligence investigation. Based upon new information obtained in this investigation, the Joint Venture accrued $2.1 million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 for remediation costs at the Auto Parts Business's store locations. No environmental proceedings are pending at any of these sites.  OPERATING INCOME FROM JOINT VENTURES. The Company's joint ventures' revenues and results of operations were as follows (in thousands):                                                                            Year Ended August 31,                                                                     ------------------------------                                                                         2004              2003                                                                     ------------      ------------      Total revenues from external customers recognized by: Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business:          Processing                                                 $  1,038,373      $    616,958          Brokering                                                       489,030           251,431 Joint Venture suppliers of metals                                         12,644             8,877                                                                     ------------      ------------                                                                     $  1,540,047      $    877,266                                                                     ============      ============  Operating income from joint ventures recognized by the Company: Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business                     $     61,672      $     24,827 Joint Venture suppliers of metals                                           (101)             (406)                                                                     ------------      ------------                                                                     $     61,571      $     24,421                                                                     ============      ============   The Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals. The increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices and higher volumes. Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures were 3.6 million tons for the year ended                                         28                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  August 31, 2004 compared with 3.3 million tons in the prior year. The volume of ferrous metal brokered by the joint ventures increased to 2.7 million tons in fiscal 2004 compared to 1.7 million tons in the prior year, which came primarily from increased market share in Mexico and Latin America coupled with product line expansion into other scrap metal related commodities. The average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to $187 per ton from $118 per ton, due to the same worldwide supply and demand factors affecting the wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business.  In fiscal 2004, the Company's share of income from Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business increased to $61.7 million due to higher average net selling prices, increased margins and more efficient operations, benefiting from similar market factors and pricing as described in the discussion above relating to the Company's wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business. The Company's joint ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation earned nearly all of this operating income. The Company's share of operating income from the global brokering joint venture increased from $2.3 million in fiscal 2003 to $11.3 million in fiscal 2004. The Company's share of joint venture operating income in fiscal 2004 also included an estimated $3.4 million from a joint venture contract with New York City for the processing and disposal of curbside recycling materials that commenced in April 2004. The contract with New York City is an interim contract, and the Company's present intention is not to participate in the anticipated long-tem contract, so the income stream from this contract could end at any time. Operating income in fiscal 2004 was reduced by $6.1 million representing the Company's share of the joint venture LIFO inventory adjustment compared with a reduction of $2.2 million in fiscal 2003.  SELLING EXPENSES. Selling expenses increased $0.8 million over fiscal 2003 primarily due to increased advertising expenses in the Auto Parts Business.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and Administrative expenses increased $11.0 million over fiscal 2003. The higher general and administrative expenses were due to higher bonus expense as well as increased spending on Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and professional fees. The Company's bonus plan is based upon the principles of Economic Value Added (EVA) and is directly tied to the financial performance of the Company. Given the Company's recent record financial performance, bonus expense is significantly higher in fiscal 2004.  INTEREST EXPENSE. In fiscal 2004, interest expense increased $0.3 million compared to fiscal 2003 due to higher average debt balances during fiscal 2004.  INCOME TAX PROVISION. The 31% tax rate for fiscal 2004 compares with a tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2003. The increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to a reduction in estimated Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI) tax benefits on export sales, an increase partially offset by the reversal of the $6.1 million deferred tax valuation allowance associated with Net Operating Loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards. The Company's tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal 2005 due to a change in the tax law phasing out ETI tax benefits over the next two years and the deferred tax valuation allowance being fully reversed.  FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002 - -----------------------------------  REVENUES. Consolidated revenues increased $146.2 million (42%) to $496.9 million for fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. Revenues for the Metals Recycling Business increased due to higher selling prices and volumes as worldwide demand for ferrous metals strengthened through the year. Revenues for the Steel Manufacturing Business also increased due to higher average net selling prices and increased sales volumes. Consolidated revenues also increased by $65.2 million due to the addition of the Auto Parts Business as a consolidated business.  The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $308.6 million, before intercompany eliminations, which is an increase of $86.7 million (39%). Ferrous revenues increased $81.8 million (47%) to $255.3 million as a result of an increase in tons sold and higher average selling prices net of shipping cost (average net selling prices). Ferrous sales volumes increased 255,000 tons (16%) and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased $28 (30%) to $122 per ton. Curtailed supplies of ferrous recycled metals from the countries of the former Soviet Union, growing worldwide demand and the weakness of the U.S. dollar drove the volume and price increases. In fiscal 2003, the Metals Recycling Business made export shipments aggregating 1.2 million tons, an increase of 89,000 tons (8%) compared with fiscal 2002. Domestic third-party ferrous tonnage also increased by 38,000 tons (46%) to 120,000 tons. Sales to the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business increased 31% to 535,000 tons due to increased demand in this business. Nonferrous revenues increased $6.1 million (15%) to $47.8 million due primarily to higher average prices. The average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal 2003 was $0.42 per pound, an increase of $0.06 per pound from fiscal 2002.                                         29                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  The Steel Manufacturing Business' revenues increased $25.3 million (15%) from revenues recognized in the prior year to $191.9 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher average net selling prices and higher volumes for all major product lines. The volume of finished steel products sold increased, along with the average net selling price per ton, compared with fiscal 2002. Sales of finished steel products were up 9% to 622,000 tons while the average net selling price per ton increased $15 per ton (5%) to $291 per ton. The increase in the average sales price per ton was primarily due to a higher valued product sales mix and lower supplies of competing importing steel, which was partially attributed to the weakness of the U.S. dollar. Also, towards the end of the fiscal 2003 second quarter, the Company and other steel producers increased their selling prices for rebar and coiled rebar. Additionally, merchant bar selling prices have increased modestly to adjust to the costs of production. The increase in sales volume was due to a 30% increase in the volume of wire rod and a 6% increase in sales volume of rebar. The higher wire rod volume was due to import duties imposed by the U.S. Government in the spring of 2002 on certain wire rod products. The increase in rebar volumes is primarily due to increased demand as wholesale customers bought inventory ahead of the effective date of announced price increases.  As previously mentioned, the Auto Parts Business was acquired on February 14, 2003 and was considered a "step" acquisition allowing the consolidation of its financial results as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. As such, revenues for fiscal 2003 included $65.2 million related to the Auto Parts Business with no comparable revenues being recognized for financial statement purposes in fiscal 2002. In order to aid the reader's understanding of the financial performance of this segment, the pro forma fiscal 2002 revenues for the Auto Parts Business were $58.3 million. The $6.9 million (12%) increase was primarily caused by an increase in wholesale revenues driven by higher average sales prices for scrapped autobodies due to rising ferrous recycled metal prices. Wholesale prices also benefited from the implementation of a new "core" distribution center that aggregated production volumes and provided an improved venue to sell these products to competing customers. Retail revenues were also up due to growth in part sales and admissions pricing.  COST OF GOODS SOLD. Consolidated cost of goods sold increased $88.6 million (27%) to $413.0 million and was 83% percent of revenues compared with 93% in fiscal 2002. The decrease to 83% was primarily due to improved margins, coming principally from higher selling prices, for all of the Company's business segments.  Cost of goods sold for the Metals Recycling Business increased $56.0 million (28%) to $255.9 million before intercompany eliminations. The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from 90% for fiscal 2002 to 83% during fiscal 2003, contributing to a $30.7 million increase in gross profit. This increase in gross margin in fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to higher selling prices and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher prices paid to suppliers of ferrous recycled metals and higher export freight rates, resulting in an $18 per ton (18%) increase in the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton. Cost of sales per ferrous ton increased as higher selling prices and higher demand for processed metal pushed up the purchase price the Company paid for unprocessed metal. Competition from other recyclers for the purchase of unprocessed metal was also a factor in the cost increases. The average export freight rate climbed $4 per ton in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002.  Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business increased $21.8 million (13%) to $191.0 million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 102% in fiscal 2002 to 100% in fiscal 2003. The decrease was due to a higher average sales price per ton and lowered fixed cost per ton, due to larger production volumes spreading the fixed costs over more tons produced, partially offset by higher prices paid for scrap metal. Melt shop production increased 32% and rolling mill production increased 16% compared with fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 production volumes were temporarily curtailed in order to reduce inventory to better match it with customer demand. Average cost of sales per ton increased $10 per ton (3%) compared with the prior fiscal year. As this increase in cost of sales per ton was more than offset by the $15 per ton increase in average net selling price, gross profit improved by $3.5 million (135%) in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002.  The Auto Parts Business' cost of sales was $0.5 million (1%) lower during fiscal 2003 as compared to the pro forma cost of sales for fiscal 2002. As a percentage of revenues, cost of sales decreased from 63% to 55%. This improvement was due to higher margins realized on wholesale sales partially offset by higher labor costs.                                         30                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER NONRECURRING CHARGES. In connection with the acquisition of the Auto Parts Business, the Company conducted an environmental due diligence investigation. Based upon new information obtained in this investigation, the Joint Venture accrued $2.1 million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 for remediation costs at the Auto Parts Business's store locations. No environmental proceedings are pending at any of these sites.  The Company recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges of $7.1 million in fiscal 2002. The Company recorded nonrecurring charges of $1.9 million for the early termination of a fixed-price Alaska barge contract of affreightment that management determined was not cost effective. The Alaska barge contract charge included a $0.9 million write-off of a note receivable and a $1.0 million payment to terminate the contract. Also, an impairment charge of $1.8 million was recorded for the elimination of an unprofitable car-crushing business and an impairment charge of $1.1 million was recorded for the closure of an under-performing yard in Reno, Nevada. Nonrecurring charges of $1.5 million were recorded for the loss on the early termination of two vessel charter contracts with a related company. The Company terminated the leases in order to take advantage of market rates which were $7 to $8 per ton lower than the all-in contracted rates. Shipping cost savings as a result of the contract termination totaled approximately $2.0 million. Additionally, a loss of $0.8 million was recorded for the sale of a non-strategic steel forging business.  OPERATING INCOME FROM JOINT VENTURES. The Company's joint ventures' revenues and results of operations were as follows (in thousands):                                                                            Year Ended August 31,                                                                     ------------------------------                                                                         2003              2002                                                                     ------------      ------------      Total revenues from external customers recognized by: Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business:          Processing                                                 $    616,958      $    480,157          Brokering                                                       251,431           144,962 Joint Venture suppliers of metals                                          8,877            61,762                                                                     ------------      ------------                                                                     $    877,266      $    686,881                                                                     ============      ============  Operating income from joint ventures recognized by the Company: Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business                     $     24,827      $     13,766 Joint Venture suppliers of metals                                           (406)            5,624                                                                     ------------      ------------                                                                     $     24,421      $     19,390                                                                     ============      ============   The Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals. The increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices. Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures were 3.3 million tons for the year ended August 31, 2003 compared with 3.5 million tons in the prior year. The volume of ferrous metal brokered by the joint ventures increased to 1.7 million tons in fiscal 2003 compared to 1.2 million tons in the prior year. The average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to $118 per ton from $90 per ton, predominantly due to strong demand from Asia, especially China and Korea. These joint ventures also increased their sales margins by improving operational efficiencies.  In fiscal 2003, the Company's share of income from Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business increased to $24.8 million due to higher average net selling prices, increased margins and more efficient operations. The Company's joint ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation, which earned the majority of the income, instituted EVA concurrently with the Company in fiscal 2001. The use of EVA coupled with management changes has continued to result in improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability. Operating income in fiscal 2003 was reduced by $2.2 million representing the Company's share of the JV LIFO inventory adjustment compared with a reduction of $1.2 million in fiscal 2002.                                         31                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  Revenues of the Joint Venture suppliers of metals decreased by $52.9 million from fiscal 2002 as compared to the fiscal 2003. Most of this decrease was caused by the reclassification in fiscal 2003 of the Pick-N-Pull Joint Venture, which is now consolidated and included as a new business segment, the Auto Parts Business. Excluding the change caused by this reclassification, revenues decreased $7.0 million during fiscal 2003 compared to last year due to lower selling prices and lower demolition revenue. The Company's equity in income from these Joint Ventures, excluding the impact of Pick-N-Pull, decreased $1.1 million primarily due to the slowdown in the U.S. economy.  SELLING EXPENSES. These expenses increased $2.4 million compared with fiscal 2002 primarily due to an increase in export commission expense caused from higher ferrous recycled metals export sales.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Compared with fiscal 2002, general and administrative expenses increased $6.2 million. The consolidation of the Auto Parts Business represents $5.0 million of this increase. The remainder of this increase is primarily due to increased bonus accruals directly related to the improvement in the Company's EVA performance.  INTEREST EXPENSE. In fiscal 2003, interest expense decreased $0.5 million compared with fiscal 2002 due to lower average interest rates and borrowings. The Company's borrowings averaged $70.5 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $75.9 million in fiscal 2002. The average interest rate for fiscal 2003 was 2.1% compared with 2.7% for fiscal 2002.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES. Other income and expenses decreased $0.7 million in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. The difference is principally due to the addition of the Auto Parts Business and a harbor maintenance tax refund received in fiscal 2002. In addition, this line item includes market value adjustments for changes in investment performance for securities held in a trust for the purpose of funding future non-qualified pension payments. The Company recognized gains from the trust fund assets in the amount of $0.4 million in fiscal 2003 and losses of $0.4 million in fiscal 2002.  INCOME TAX PROVISION. The Company's effective rate of 27% for fiscal 2003 was lower than the 35% federal statutory tax rate for three primary reasons: (1) the implementation of SFAS 142 eliminated the amortization of goodwill, some of which had been nondeductible; (2) export sales, which under Federal law are taxed at a lower rate than domestic sales increased; and (3) net operating loss carryforwards that accompanied an earlier acquisition continued to provide benefit. The fiscal 2002 tax rate of 14% benefited from the two latter items, as well as from the one-time recognition of California tax credits that had been generated over the previous ten years.  As part of the 1996 acquisition of Proler International Corp. (Proler), the Company acquired $31.4 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). The Company recognized no immediate tax benefit for the NOLs. Instead, the Company set up an offsetting $31.4 million valuation allowance because the ultimate use of the NOLs was uncertain given the then-current federal tax law proscription against applying the NOLs to any taxable income other than the post-acquisition income generated by Proler. A change to federal tax law in 1999, however, allowed an annual $2.4 million of NOL to be applied to taxable income from all sources, not just from Proler. Due to this change in tax law, the Company released an annual $2.4 million from the valuation allowance, and recognized the corresponding $0.8 million in tax benefit, in fiscal years 2003 and 2002. This is a major reason why the Company's effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rates for those years.  The Company also acquired $0.7 million of credits as part of the Proler acquisition. As with the NOLs, a valuation allowance was set up to offset the credits. No part of the valuation allowance had been released as of August 31, 2003. The credits are not likely to be used until after the NOLs have been used or expire. The credits can be carried forward indefinitely.  In fiscal 2002, the Company qualified for $2.1 million of Enterprise Zone tax credits in the state of California. These credits can be used to offset California state income taxes to the extent that the Company has a California franchise (income) tax liability on taxable income apportionable to each zone. Any credits in excess of the tax liability can be carried forward indefinitely. These credits, combined with the release of $2.4 million of valuation allowance pertaining                                         32                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  to the NOLs, were major reasons why the Company's effective tax rate of 14% for fiscal 2002 was well below the statutory rate of 35%.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. - -------------------------------- For fiscal 2004, cash generated from operations was $73.2 million, compared to $40.9 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in cash flow from operations was primary related to an improvement in net income, offset by the reinvestment of cash flow by the Hugo Neu joint ventures and an increase in inventories, which is a result of higher inventory quantities on hand at August 31, 2004 and increased inventory costs for raw materials at all divisions.  Capital expenditures totaled $22.2 million, $21.8 million, and $9.6 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 included production improvement projects, including partial payments on the new state-of-the-art mega shredder at the Company's Oakland, California recycling facility and the major furnace replacement at our Steel Manufacturing Business.  In March 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of three self-service used auto parts stores in Canada for a purchase price of $13.7 million. During fiscal 2004, the Company also made additional post-closing payments of $11.8 million related to the acquisition of Pick and Pull Auto Dismantling, Inc., which closed in February 2003.  As a result of acquisitions completed in prior years, the Company had $21.5 million of environment liabilities as of August 31, 2004. Over the next 12 months, the Company expects to pay approximately $9.3 million relating to a previously accrued remediation projects in connection with one of its metals recycling facilities located in the State of Washington on the Hylebos Waterway. Additionally, the Company expects to require significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of other such environmental liabilities.  As of August 31, 2004, the Company had a committed unsecured bank credit facility totaling $150 million that matures in May 2006. The credit facility contains a provision whereby the Company may, upon obtaining consent of the bank group, extend the term of the agreement by one year to May 2007. The Company has provided notice of its intention to request such an extension and the bank group has agreed to the request. The extension is subject to the Company providing standard representations and warranties as of the May 2006 original maturity date. The Company currently anticipates it will be able to provide the required representations and warranties and the agreement will be extended. The Company also has additional unsecured credit lines totaling $20 million, which are uncommitted. The Company's debt agreements have certain restrictive covenants. As of August 31, 2004, the Company had aggregate bank borrowings outstanding under these facilities of $60.0 million and was in compliance with such covenants.  In July 2002, the Company's metals recycling joint ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation entered into a revolving credit facility (JV Credit Facility) with a group of banks for working capital and general corporate purposes. Prior to that time, the joint ventures' working capital and other cash needs had been met by advances provided equally by the Company and its partner, Hugo Neu Corporation. During February 2004, the facility was increased to $110 million. The JV Credit Facility expires on January 26, 2005 and is secured by the inventory and receivables of the joint venture businesses. The Company is not a guarantor of the JV Credit Facility. The JV Credit Facility has a number of covenants and restrictions, including restrictions on the level of distributions to the joint venture partners. As of August 31, 2004, there was no debt outstanding under the credit facility and the joint ventures were in compliance with these covenants. It is the Company's present intention to not renew the facility upon its expiration, in which case the Company and its partner will need to revert to funding the cash needs of the joint ventures on an equal basis.  The joint venture agreements allow for distributions to the joint venture partners. During the two year period ended August 31, 2004, the Company recorded $86.0 million in operating income representing its share in the earnings of the joint ventures. However, during this time the Company received no cash distributions. Instead, the Hugo-Neu joint ventures have been utilizing all of their available cash flow to fund expansion of working capital, business growth, and investment in state-of-the-art equipment to improve the efficiencies and capabilities of their business and to pay down borrowings from the JV Credit Facility.                                         33                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  The joint ventures in the metals recycling business are purchasing and installing three new mega-shredders in fiscal 2005 for an estimated cost of $36 million. The joint venture partners anticipate using a long-term equipment financing facility to support the purchase. The joint ventures would make principal and interest payments on the financing facility from operating income.  The Company has certain contractual obligations to make future payments. The following table summarizes these future obligations as of August 31, 2004 (in thousands):           CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS                              Payments Due By Period         -----------------------           ------------------------------------------------------------                                                        Less than      1-3          4-5         After 5                                             Total       1 Year       Years        Years         Years                                           --------     --------     --------     --------     --------                     Long-term debt(1)                $ 68,026     $    225     $ 60,101     $     --     $  7,700          Interest payments on long-             term debt                        1,488           97          194          194        1,003          Operating leases                  127,675        7,067       10,375        7,193      103,040           PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS:              Gas contract(2)                27,767        5,749       17,246        4,772           --              Electric contract(3)            2,184        2,016          168           --           --           OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES              ON BALANCE SHEET:          Environmental liabilities          21,499        9,373          450          400       11,276          Long-term supplemental             retirement plan liability        2,172           --          127          329        1,716                                           --------     --------     --------     --------     --------          Total                            $250,811     $ 24,527     $ 88,661     $ 12,888     $124,735                                           ========     ========     ========     ========     ========  (1)   The Company has a $150 million credit facility with a group of banks for working capital and       other general purposes. The facility expires in May 2006, but may be extended one year after the       Company meets certain administrative requirements. (2)   The Steel Manufacturing Business has a take-or-pay natural gas contract with IGI Resources that       requires a minimum purchase of 3,500 MMBTU per day at tiered pricing, whether or not the amount       is utilized. The natural gas price as of August 31, 2004 was $4.50 MMBTU. Any amount that is not       utilized may be resold to IGI Resources. The contract expires on May 31, 2009. (3)   The Steel Manufacturing Business has an electricity contract with McMinnville Power and Light       that requires a minimum purchase of electricity at a rate subject to variable pricing, whether       or not the amount is utilized. Any amount that is not utilized may be resold to the Bonneville       Power Administration. The contract expires in September 2005.   Pursuant to a stock repurchase program which began in 1997, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 3.0 million shares of its stock when management believes such repurchases would enhance shareholder value. During fiscal year 2004, the Company made no share repurchases. As of August 31, 2004, the Company had repurchased a total of 1.3 million shares under this program.  The Company makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan, several defined contribution plans and several multiemployer pension plans. Contributions vary depending on the plan and are based upon plan provisions, actuarial valuations and negotiated labor agreements. We anticipate making contributions of approximately $6.0 million to the various pension plans in fiscal 2005.  The Company believes its current cash resources, internally generated funds, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide adequate financing for capital expenditures, working capital, joint ventures, stock repurchases, debt service requirements, post retirement obligations and future environmental obligations for the next                                         34                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.

FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. This Form 10-K, including Item 1 of Part l and Item 7 of Part II, contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934, that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. One can generally identify these forward-looking statements because they contain "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "plans" and other words which convey a similar meaning. One can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Examples of factors affecting Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.'s wholly-owned operations and its joint ventures (the Company) that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following:  CYCLICALITY AND GENERAL MARKET CONSIDERATIONS: Purchase and selling prices for recycled metals are highly cyclical in nature and subject to worldwide economic conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of recycled metals are subject to global supply and demand conditions which are volatile and beyond the Company's control, resulting in periodic fluctuations in recycled metals prices and working capital requirements. While the Company attempts to maintain and grow margins by responding to changing recycled metals selling prices through adjustments to its metals purchase prices, the Company's ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. Additionally, changing prices could potentially impact the volume of recycled metal available to the Company, the subsequent volume of processed metal sold by the Company, inventory levels and the timing of collections and levels relating to the Company's accounts receivable balances. Moreover, increases in recycled metals selling prices can adversely affect the operating results of the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business because increases in steel prices generally lag increases in ferrous recycled metals prices.  The steel industry is also highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. Future economic downturns or a stagnant economy may adversely affect the performance of the Company.  The Company expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and net income. Revenues can fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter due to factors such as the seasonal slowdown in the construction industry, which is an important buyer of the Company's finished steel products. The timing and extent of the slowdown is also dependent on the weather.  Another factor which may affect revenues relates to the seasonal reduction in demand from foreign customers who tend to reduce their finished steel production and corresponding scrap metal requirements, during the summer months to offset higher energy costs. Also, severe weather conditions may affect the Company's global market conditions.  The Company makes a number of large ferrous recycled metals shipments to foreign steel producers each year. Customer requirements, shipping schedules and other factors limit the Company's control over the timing of these shipments. Variations in the number of foreign shipments from quarter to quarter will result in fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings. The Company's expectations regarding ferrous metal sales prices and volumes, as well as earnings, are based in part on a number of assumptions which are difficult to predict (for example, uncertainties relating to customer orders, metal availability, estimated freight rates, ship availability, cost and volume of unprocessed inventory and production output, etc.).  The Auto Parts Business experiences modest seasonal fluctuations in demand. The retail stores are open to the elements. During periods of extreme temperatures and precipitation, customers tend to delay their purchases and wait for milder conditions. As a result, retail sales are generally higher during the spring and fall of each calendar year and lower in the winter and summer months.  Additionally, the Auto Parts Business is subject to a number of other risks that could prevent it from maintaining or exceeding its current levels of profitability, such as volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for its products, services and raw materials; environmental issues; local and worldwide                                         35                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  economic conditions; increased competition; the ultimate success of the Company's growth and acquisition plans; and business integration and management transition issues.  COMPETITION: The recycled metals industry is highly competitive, with the volume of purchases and sales subject to a number of competitive factors, principally price. The Company competes with both large and numerous smaller companies in its markets for the purchase of recyclable metals. The Company also competes with a number of domestic and foreign recycled metals processors and brokers for processed and unprocessed metal as well as for sales to domestic and foreign customers. For example, in 2001 and 2002, lower cost ferrous recycled metals supplies from certain foreign countries adversely affected market selling prices for ferrous recycled metals. Since then, many of these countries have imposed export restrictions which have significantly reduced their export volumes and lowered the worldwide supply of ferrous recycled metals. These restrictions are believed to have had a positive effect on the Company's selling prices. Given the intricacies in which the global markets operate, the Company cannot predict when or if foreign countries will change their trading policies and what effect, if any, such changes might have on the Company's operating results.  From time to time, both the United States and foreign governments impose regulations and restrictions on trade in the markets in which the Company operates. In fiscal 2004, the Company completed filing requirements with China to continue to allow the shipment of recycled metals into China. The documents are part of a certification process to ensure safe industrial and agricultural production in China. Also, it is not unusual for various constituencies to petition government entities to impose new restrictions or change current laws. If imposed, these restrictions could affect the Company's margins as well as its ability to ship goods to foreign customers. Alternatively, restrictions could also affect the global availability of ferrous recycled metals, thereby affecting the Company's volumes and margins. As a result, it is difficult to predict what, if any, impact pending or future trade restrictions will have on the operations of the Company.  For the Metals Recycling Business, some of the more significant domestic competitors include regional steel mills and their brokers who compete for recycled metal for the purpose of providing the mill with feedstock to produce finished steel. During periods when market supplies of metal are in short supply, these buyers may, at times, react by raising buying prices to levels that are not reasonable in relation to more normal market conditions. As a result, the Company may have to raise its buying prices to maintain its production levels which may result in compressed margins.  The Auto Parts Business competes with both full-service and self-service auto dismantlers as well as larger well financed retail auto parts chains for retail customers. Periodically, the Auto Parts Business increases prices, which may affect customer flow and buying patterns. Additionally, in markets where the Company has only a few stores, it does not have the same pricing power it experiences in markets where it has more than one store in which it operates. As this segment expands, the Company may experience new competition from others attempting to replicate the Company's business model. The ultimate impact of these dynamics cannot be predicted. Also, the business competes for its automobile inventory with other dismantlers, used car dealers, auto auctions and metal recyclers. Inventory costs can fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions and prices for recycled metal.  The domestic steel industry also is highly competitive. Steel prices can be highly volatile and price is a significant competitive factor. The Company competes domestically with several steel producers in the Western United States for sales of its products. In recent years, the Company has experienced significant foreign competition, which is sometimes subsidized by large government agencies. There can be no assurance that such competition will not increase in the future. In the spring of 2002, the U.S. Government imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties against wire rod products from eight foreign countries. These duties have assisted the Company in increasing sales of wire rod products; any expiration or termination of the duties could have a corresponding adverse effect.  In December 2002, Nucor Corporation ("Nucor") assumed ownership of the assets of Birmingham Steel Corp., and acquired a steel manufacturing business in Seattle, Washington. Nucor Corporation, the leader in setting finished steel prices in the Company's finished steel markets, has a significant share of the West Coast steel market and is considered an aggressive competitor. Nucor has consolidated much of the West Coast domestic steel production with the 2002 purchase of the former Birmingham Steel Mill in Seattle, Washington and the former North Star mill in Kingman,                                         36                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  Arizona. The Kingman mill has been idle since 2003, any future start-up of its operations could negatively impact the Company's recycled metal and finished steel markets, prices, margins and, potentially, cash flow.  GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION: The Company competes in the scrap metal business through its wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business as well as through its joint venture businesses. Over the last few years, a significant portion of the revenues and operating profits earned in these segments have been generated from sales to Asian countries, principally China and South Korea. In addition, the Company's sales in these countries are also concentrated with relatively few customers that vary depending on buying cycles and general market conditions. Due to the concentration of sales in these countries and to a relatively small customer base, a significant change in buying patterns, change in political events, change in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other export restrictions within the United States or these foreign countries, severe weather conditions or general changes in economic conditions could adversely affect the financial results of the Company.  UNION CONTRACTS: The Company has a number of union contracts that expire in fiscal year 2005. Labor contract negotiations have not commenced with any of these unions. If the Company is unable to reach agreement on the terms of a new contract with any of these unions, the Company could be subject to work slowdowns or work stoppages.  POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS: The Company has a number of post retirement benefit plans that include defined benefit and multiemployer plans. The Company's contributions to the defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial calculations which are based on a number of estimates including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, allocation of plan assets between equity or fixed income investments, expected rate of compensation increases as well as other factors. Changes in these actual rates from year to year cause increases or decreases in the Company's annual contributions into the defined benefit plans and changes to the expenses recognized in a current fiscal year. Management and the actuary evaluate these rates annually and adjust if necessary.  The Company's union employees participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans. The Company is not the sponsor or administrator of these multiemployer plans. Contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of the negotiated labor contracts. The Company is unable to determine its relative portion or estimate its future liability under the multiemployer pension plans.  The Company learned during the fourth quarter of 2004 that one of the multiemployer plans would not meet ERISA minimum funding standards for the plan year ending September 30, 2004. The trustees of that plan have applied to the Internal Revenue Service for certain relief from this minimum funding standard, but cannot determine whether this relief will be granted. Absent relief, the plan's contributing employers will be required to make additional contributions or pay excise tax that may equal or exceed the full amount of that deficiency. The Company estimates its share of the required additional contribution for the 2004 plan year is approximately $1.1 million and has accrued for such amount in fiscal 2004.  JOINT VENTURES: The Company has significant investments in joint venture companies, the most substantial of which are its five metals recycling joint ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation (HNC). In each case, the day-to-day activities of the joint venture business are managed by the Company's joint venture partner, not the Company. As a result, the Company does not have the same ability to control or predict the operations, cash flow, expenditures, debt, and related financial results as it does with its consolidated businesses. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the financial results of the joint ventures.  In recent years, the Company's relationship with the chief executive officer of HNC, its most significant joint venture partner, has deteriorated. There have been disagreements regarding business decisions as well as personality clashes, but the Company does not believe that these issues have materially affected the operations or operating results of the joint ventures, which have shown dramatic financial improvement since fiscal 2000. The Company is currently disputing HNC's recent unilateral assertion of a right to be paid certain commissions on sales by the joint venture engaged in global brokering of recycled metals, as described in more detail in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. As described in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, the Company's present intention is to not renew the $110 million JV Credit Facility when it matures in January 2005, and for the Company and HNC to revert to funding the cash needs of the joint ventures on an equal basis. If HNC does not fund its share of joint venture cash needs, the operations of the global brokering joint venture, which has relied extensively on the JV Credit Facility for working capital support, could be adversely affected.  The Company believes it desirable for the Company and HNC to end the current joint venture relationships; however, the joint venture agreements do not provide for a mechanism to break up the ventures. Preliminary discussions regarding possible transactions to terminate the relationship occur from time to time, but these discussions have not resulted in any agreement regarding the structure, valuation or terms of such a transaction. As such discussions periodically continue, the Company will evaluate its disclosure obligations, but does not presently intend to make any further disclosure regarding the existence or status of such discussions unless and until an agreement is reached, if ever.                                         37                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  The Company believes it desirable for the Company and HNC to end the current joint venture relationships; however, the joint venture agreements do not provide for a mechanism to break up the ventures.

As such discussions periodically continue, the Company will evaluate its disclosure obligations, but does not presently intend to make any further disclosure regarding the existence or status of such discussions unless and until an agreement is reached, if ever.  The joint venture businesses are affected by many of the same risk factors mentioned in this document. Additionally, two of these joint ventures continue to use LIFO inventory accounting, which tends to defer income taxes. Historically, the effects of LIFO adjustments, which are recorded during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, have been difficult to predict.  ENERGY SUPPLY: The Company and its joint ventures utilize various energy sources to operate their facilities. In particular, electricity and natural gas currently represent approximately 9% of the cost of steel manufactured for the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business. The Steel Manufacturing Business purchases electric power under a long-term contract from McMinnville Water & Light (McMinnville) which in turn relies on the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). Historically, these contracts have had favorable prices and are long-term in nature. The Company has a five-year contract that expires in September 2006. On October 1, 2001, the BPA increased its electricity rates due to increased demand on the West Coast and lower supplies. This increase was in the form of a Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause (CRAC) added to BPA's contract with McMinnville. The CRAC is an additional monthly surcharge on selected power charges to recover costs associated with buying higher priced power during the West Coast power shortage. Because BPA can adjust the CRAC every six months, it is not possible to predict future rate changes.  The Steel Manufacturing Business also has a contract for natural gas at $4.50 MMBTU. The current contract expires on May 31, 2009 and obligates the business to purchase minimum amounts of gas at a fixed rate. Effective November 1, 2004, the natural gas rate will be reduced to $4.39 per MMBTU. This is a take or pay contract with a minimum average usage of 3,575 MMBTU per day. Gas not used is sold on the open market and gains or losses are recorded in cost of sales.  If the Company is unable to negotiate favorable terms of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources, this could adversely affect the performance of the Company.  TAX LAWS: The Company has been able to reduce its effective tax rate below the federal statutory tax rate for each of the last three years by using a combination of Net Operating Loss carryforwards (NOLs), tax credits in State of California Enterprise Zones, and federal Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI) tax benefits associated with making foreign sales. In response to recent determinations by the World Trade Organization that the ETI tax benefit constituted an illegal export subsidy, Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act), which became law on October 22, 2004. A key provision of the Act eliminates the ETI deduction over the next two years, offsetting it in part with a deduction for "qualified production activities income." Until regulations are issued explaining the new deduction, any projection of its effect on the Company's worldwide tax rate would necessarily be imprecise, but the current projection is that the tax rate would approximate 36% in fiscal 2005.  The Company's worldwide tax rate is also apt to be higher in fiscal 2005 for two reasons unrelated to the Act: All net operation losses (NOLs) have been used for GAAP purposes, and further discovery of significant state tax credits is unlikely. As noted above, both items have served to reduce the effective tax rate in recent years.  CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS: Demand from the Company's foreign customers is partially driven by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Recent weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies has been a significant factor in the increases in recycled metals prices over the last year, as well as resulted in increasing the cost of certain finished steel imports. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the competitiveness of the Company's products in the markets in which the Company competes. The Company has no control over such fluctuations and, as such, these dynamics could affect the Company's revenues and earnings.                                         38                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K  SHIPPING AND HANDLING: Both the Metals Recycling Business and the Steel Manufacturing Business often rely on third parties to handle and transport their products to end users in a timely manner. The cost to transport the products, in particular by ocean freight, can be affected by circumstances over which the Company has no control such as fuel prices, political events, governmental regulations on transportation and changes in market rates due to carrier availability. In estimating future operating results, the Company makes certain assumptions regarding shipping costs. Given the recent tightness in the ocean freight market, the Company has experienced significant increases in its shipping costs which have adversely affected operating income. Since it is difficult to predict the future costs for shipping the Company's products, actual results could differ materially from forecasts.  INSURANCE: The cost of the Company's insurance is affected not only by its own loss experience but also by cycles in the insurance market. The Company cannot predict future events and circumstances which could cause rates to materially change such as war, terrorist activities or natural disasters.  ASSET ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION: Throughout the Company's history, it has made a number of acquisitions and divestures as management attempts to improve the value of the Company for its shareholders. Over the last few years this activity has principally been limited to acquisitions related to the Auto Parts Business. It is anticipated that the Company will continue to pursue additional expansion of the Auto Parts Business as well as other business segments. Each acquisition or disposition comes with its own inherent risks that make it difficult to predict the ultimate success of the transaction. An acquisition or disposition may have a negative and/or unexpected impact on the Company's cash flow, operating income, net income, earnings per share and financial position.  INTERCOMPANY SALES: The Auto Parts Business sells autobodies to the Metals Recycling Business, and the Metals Recycling Business sells ferrous recycled metal to the Steel Manufacturing Business, at prices that are intended to approximate market. When the Company consolidates its results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company eliminates the intercompany sales and purchases and also eliminates the estimated profit remaining in inventory ("Profit Elimination") at the end of each reporting period. In estimating future operating and financial performance, the Company makes assumptions regarding the forecasted Profit Elimination computation and its impact on the quarterly financial results of the Company. Small variations in price, sales volume, production volume, and purchase prices and volumes from both within the Company and from third parties can result in significant differences between forecasted Profit Elimination and actual results.  It is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the Company's forward-looking statements. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. Further, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.    ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates. Because such derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent incremental risk to the Company.
