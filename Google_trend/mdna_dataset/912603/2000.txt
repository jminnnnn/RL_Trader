ITEM 7.      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The results of operations of the Company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products on the U.S. West Coast. For example, increasing steel demand and prices led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal 1995 through fiscal 1997. However, primarily due to the Asian financial crisis, which severely curtailed demand and decreased prices, fiscal 1998 and 1999 results for the Metals Recycling Business were negatively impacted. During fiscal 2000, the Company saw demand for recycled metal rise, but unusually large supply became available in certain of the countries that were part of the former Soviet Union, which held prices down. In addition domestic demand for finished steel products was strong, but lower cost imports, primarily from Asia, caused average prices to generally decline.  The following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the Company's Metals Recycling Business and Steel Manufacturing Business, and the breakdown of income from operations between the Metals Recycling Business, the Steel Manufacturing Business and Joint Ventures. Additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)  Corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expense for      services that benefit both the Metals Recycling Business and the Steel      Manufacturing Business. Because of this unallocated expense, the income      from operations of each segment does not reflect the income from operations      the segment would have as a stand-alone business.   FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999  REVENUES. Revenues for both the Metals Recycling Business and the Steel Manufacturing Business increased resulting in an overall improvement in consolidated revenues of $68.8 million to $333.8 million for fiscal 2000 compared with fiscal 1999. The strengthening Asian economies had a particularly positive impact on volume and prices for the Metals Recycling Business in fiscal 2000.  The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $188.4 million, before intercompany eliminations, an increase of $51.3 million (37%). Ferrous revenues increased $40.1 million (39%) to $141.8 million as a result of both higher volumes and higher average selling prices, both of which were primarily caused by the rebounding Asian economies. Ferrous volumes increased 282,000 tons (23%) while the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased $12 per ton (14%) to $95 per ton. The Metals Recycling Business made export shipments aggregating 761,000 tons during fiscal 2000 compared with export shipments totaling 491,000 tons during the prior year. Domestic third-party tonnage increased by 27% to 247,000 tons. Sales to the Company's Steel Business decreased by 8% to 498,000 tons. Nonferrous revenues increased $12.8 million (49%) to $38.8 million due to higher volumes and higher average selling prices. Increased exports and a strong domestic market were primarily responsible for the nonferrous improvements, as well as the Metals Recycling Business' ability to produce more nonferrous products. Nonferrous volumes increased 21.7 million pounds (29%) and the average selling price increased $0.05 per pound (14%).  The Steel Manufacturing Business recognized revenues for fiscal 2000 of $192.4 million, an increase of 11% from revenues recognized in the prior year. Although the volume of finished steel products sold increased, the average selling price per ton declined. Sales of finished steel products increased 17% to 666,000 tons as strong demand enabled the Company to substantially increase production and sales of wire rod products. However, the average selling price declined $14 per ton (5%) to $289 per ton. The decline in average selling prices is primarily attributable to the dumping of lower priced steel products by Asian companies on the West Coast. The decline in the average selling price is also partially due to a change in product mix. During fiscal 2000, the Steel Manufacturing Business shipped proportionately more lower-priced products (principally wire rod) than in the prior year.                                      24                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)  COST OF GOODS SOLD. Consolidated cost of goods sold increased $55.7 million (23%) to $296.6 million and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 89%, compared with 91% in fiscal 1999. Gross profit increased by $13.1 million (54%) to $37.2 million.  The Metals Recycling Business' cost of goods sold increased $37.1 million to $161.0 million before intercompany eliminations. Cost of sales per ferrous ton increased due to increased foreign demand for processed metal that directly impacted the demand for and cost of unprocessed metals. The increase in the cost of unprocessed metal was more than offset by the increase in the average selling price increasing gross profit $5.0 million compared with the previous fiscal year. Income from operations for fiscal 2000 increased $13.0 million compared with fiscal 1999, primarily due to the stronger Asian economies.  Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business increased $19.0 million (12%). Cost of sales per ton, excluding billets, declined by $13 per ton primarily due to increased production that spread the allocation of fixed costs over more tons. Lower average selling prices more than offset this decline in operating costs per ton, but increased sales volume resulted in a gross profit of $10.7 million which was $0.7 million higher than in fiscal 1999.  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million to $26.5 million. Of this increase, $1.6 million was due to annual salary merit increases and additional bonus accruals based on significant improvement in results during fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2000 expenses also included $0.4 million in write-offs of uncollectible debts.  INCOME FROM JOINT VENTURES. The Company's joint ventures' revenues and results of operations were as follows (in thousands):                                                                          Year Ended August 31,                                                                      ---------------------                                                                      2000             1999                                                                      ----             ----      Total revenues from external customers recognized by:        Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business             $449,783         $303,014        Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                             52,444           46,575                                                                    --------         --------                                                                    $502,227         $349,589                                                                    ========         ========  Income from joint ventures recognized by the Company:        Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business             $  2,219         $  1,380        Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                              2,288            2,070                                                                    --------         --------                                                                    $  4,507         $  3,450                                                                    ========         ========    The Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business predominantly sell recycled ferrous metal. The increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher ferrous selling prices and an increase in tonnage shipped. Also, fiscal 2000 revenues include a full year's results of a joint venture organized in the third quarter of fiscal 1999. Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to 2.8 million tons for the year ended August 31, 2000 from 2.5 million tons in the prior year. The average selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to $108 per ton from $87 per ton, predominantly due to strengthening Asian and other foreign economies.  In fiscal 2000, the Company's equity in income from Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business was adversely affected by $1.1 million to reflect the Company's share of LIFO inventory adjustments. In comparison, the results for fiscal 1999 benefited from $3.3 million of LIFO and other inventory adjustments. The Company's equity in income from the Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business for fiscal 1999 included the Company's $1.4 million share of a gain recognized by one of the joint ventures from the sale of property.                                      25                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)  Both revenues and income from the Joint Venture Suppliers of Metal increased from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000 primarily due to higher ferrous selling prices.  INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense increased $0.4 million due to increased average borrowings and higher average interest rates. Average borrowings of $107.4 million in fiscal 2000 exceeded average borrowings in fiscal 1999 of $104.3 million. The average interest rate for fiscal 2000 was 6.3% compared with 5.4% for fiscal 1999.  GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS. In fiscal 2000, the Company and its outside board members approved the sale of a ship leased by the Company from a related party to export recycled metal. The sale resulted in a $1.0 million loss. Fiscal 1999 results included the Steel Manufacturing Business' sale of its Union City, California mill depot, resulting in a gain of $1.2 million.  OTHER INCOME. Other income increased $1.3 million. During fiscal 2000, the Company received a $0.7 million settlement as a result of antitrust litigation related to graphite electrodes pricing. In fiscal 1999, the Company received $1.0 million related to the same antitrust settlement. Also, the Company recognized additional interest income during fiscal 2000 of $1.9 million, related to advances to joint ventures, and $0.9 million of investment income on assets related to the supplemental executive retirement plan due to strong domestic financial markets. See Note 8.  INCOME TAX PROVISION. The Company's effective income tax rate decreased to 6% in fiscal 2000 from 55% in fiscal 1999. The decrease was primarily due to lower taxable income caused by utilization of $8.6 million of net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) that were acquired as part of the 1996 acquisition of Proler.  By acquiring Proler in 1996, the Company succeeded to $31.0 million of NOLs incurred in Proler's pre- acquisition years. Federal income tax law limits the amount of Proler pre-acquisition NOLs that can be used by the Company to $2.4 million per year. However, to the extent the respective annual limit exceeds taxable income for a taxable year, the unused excess may be carried over and used in subsequent taxable years. Previous federal tax rules limited the use of the Proler NOLs to offset taxable income only from the acquired Proler entities. The new rules now allow the Company to use the Proler NOLs to offset taxable income from all sources.  During fiscal 2000, federal income tax law changes were enacted that allow the Company somewhat greater flexibility in utilizing the Proler NOLs. These changes allowed the Company to utilize the annual limit of $2.4 million for fiscal 2000 as well as an additional $6.2 million of excess limit amounts from prior years. Subject to these annual utilization limits, the remaining $22.4 million of Proler NOLs may be used in future years until they expire at various amounts in fiscal 2007 through 2012.   FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1998  REVENUES. Revenues for both the Metals Recycling Business and the Steel Manufacturing Business decreased resulting in an overall decline in consolidated revenues of $88.1 to $265.0 million for fiscal 1999 compared with $353.1 million for fiscal 1998. The Asian financial crisis which began during fiscal 1998 continued to impact the results of both operations in fiscal 1999.  The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $137.1 million, before intercompany eliminations, a decrease of $80.8 million (37%). Ferrous revenues declined $73.6 million (42%) to $101.7 million as a result of both lower volumes and lower average selling prices, both of which were primarily caused by the financial crisis in Asia. Ferrous volumes declined 211,000 tons (15%) while the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal declined $39 per ton (32%) to $83 per ton. The Metals Recycling Business made export shipments, aggregating 491,000 tons, during fiscal 1999 compared with export shipments totaling 720,000 tons during the prior year. Domestic third-party tonnage declined by 17% to 194,000 tons. Sales to the Company's Steel Business increased by 12% to 539,000 tons.                                       26                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)  The Steel Manufacturing Business recognized revenues for fiscal 1999 of $172.7 million, a decrease of 10% from revenues recognized in the prior year. Although the volume of finished steel products sold increased, the average selling price per ton declined. Sales of finished steel products increased 3% to 571,000 tons. However, the average selling price declined $36 per ton (11%) to $303 per ton. The Company feels that the decline in average selling prices was attributable to the dumping of lower priced steel products by Asian companies on the West Coast. The decline in the average selling price was also partially due to a change in product mix. During fiscal 1999, the Steel Manufacturing Business shipped proportionately more lower-priced products than in the prior year.  COST OF GOODS SOLD. Consolidated cost of goods sold declined $71.0 million (23%) to $240.9 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 88% in fiscal 1998 to 91% in fiscal 1999. Gross profit declined by $17.0 million (41%) to $24.2 million.  The Metals Recycling Business' cost of goods sold decreased $66.0 million to $123.8 million before intercompany eliminations. Cost of sales per ferrous ton declined, as the Company lowered the purchase price of recycled metals at the scale in response to declining selling prices. However, because the average selling prices declined at a higher rate than the price of unprepared metal, gross profit for the Metals Recycling Business declined $14.8 million.  The Metals Recycling Business' cost of goods sold for the year ended August 31, 1999 was lowered by a $1.9 million reversal of environmental reserves. An independent consultant was engaged to review the Company's environmental issues and to determine its potential liabilities. Based upon the completion of certain projects at less than anticipated costs, certain previously established reserves were eliminated.  Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business declined $15.3 million (9%) despite higher volumes sold during fiscal 1999. Cost of sales per ton, excluding billets, declined by $30 per ton primarily due to lower recycled metals prices. The impact of lower average selling prices more than offset this decline in operating costs per ton, however, resulting in a gross profit of $10.0 million which was $3.3 million lower than in fiscal 1998.  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling and administrative expenses declined $0.4 million to $23.7 million as the Company endeavored to contain overhead costs.  INCOME FROM JOINT VENTURES. The Company's joint ventures' revenues and results of operations were as follows (in thousands):                                                                          Year Ended August 31,                                                                      ---------------------                                                                      1999             1998                                                                      ----             ----      Total revenues from external customers recognized by:        Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business          $   303,014       $  332,580        Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                             46,575           51,391                                                                 -----------       ----------                                                                 $   349,589       $  383,971                                                                 ===========       ========== Income from joint ventures recognized by the Company:        Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business          $     1,380       $      823        Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                              2,070            3,292                                                                 -----------       ----------                                                                 $     3,450       $    4,115                                                                 ===========       ==========                                          27                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)  The Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business predominantly sell recycled ferrous metal. The decrease in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to lower ferrous selling prices, the impact of which was partially offset by an increase in tonnage shipped. Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to 2.5 million tons for the year ended August 31, 1999 from 2.3 million tons in the prior year. The increase in ferrous recycled metal was partially due to the fact that one of the joint ventures was organized during fiscal 1998 and, thus, fiscal 1998's results only reflect a portion of a year's sales. The average selling price of ferrous recycled metal declined during that period to $87 per ton from $117 per ton, predominantly due to the Asian financial crisis and a weaker domestic market which reduced demand in those countries that traditionally purchase a large share of the worldwide supply.  The Company's equity in income from the Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business for fiscal 1999 included the Company's $1.4 million share of a gain recognized by one of the joint ventures from the sale of property. Additionally, the results for fiscal 1999 also benefited from $3.3 million of LIFO and other inventory adjustments, compared with $2.2 million for the prior year.  Both revenues and income from the Joint Venture Suppliers of Metal declined from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999 primarily due to severe weather conditions in California during the first part of fiscal 1999 which impacted demand and, thus, results of the Company's Pick-N-Pull joint venture. Additionally, prices received for the auto bodies by this joint venture were lower than in the prior year due to weakness in the recycled metals markets.  INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense increased $0.2 million due to increased average borrowings, the effect of which was partially offset by lower average interest rates. Average borrowings of $104.3 million in fiscal 1999 exceeded average borrowings in fiscal 1998 of $97.6 million. The average interest rate for fiscal 1999 was 5.4% compared with 5.8% for fiscal 1998.  GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS. During fiscal 1999, the Steel Manufacturing Business sold its Union City, California mill depot, resulting in a gain of $1.2 million. Fiscal 1998 results included a $2.2 million charge which reflected the estimated loss the Company expected to realize upon the sale of its older Tacoma shredders.  OTHER INCOME. Other income increased $2.3 million. During fiscal 1999, the Company received a $1 million settlement as a result of antitrust litigation related to graphite electrodes pricing. Also, the Company recognized additional interest income during fiscal 1999 of $.6 million.  INCOME TAX PROVISION. The Company's effective tax rate increased to 55% in fiscal 1999 from 38% in fiscal 1998. The increase was predominantly due to the lower taxable income relative to the amount of non-deductible goodwill amortization.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  For fiscal 2000, cash generated by operations was $35.4 million, which was comparable to $36.8 million for the same period last year. The increase in cash provided by growth in net income was largely offset by the impact of higher accounts receivable resulting from greater export demand as well as from the timing of larger export shipments and the related collection of the receivable.  Capital expenditures totaled $10.7 million, $12.0 million, and $14.2 million for fiscal years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.  As part of its acquisitions of Proler and MMI, the Company assumed environmental liabilities aggregating $23.4 million as of August 31, 2000. The Company expects significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of such environmental liabilities.                                   28                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)  The Company has an unsecured revolving credit agreement of $200 million. During fiscal 1998, the maturity of the facility was extended to June 2003. As of August 31, 2000, the Company also had additional lines of credit available of $50 million, which were uncommitted. In the aggregate, the Company had borrowings outstanding under these lines of $83.3 million as of August 31, 2000. The Company's debt agreements have certain restrictive covenants. As of August 31, 2000, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.  Pursuant to a stock repurchase program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 1.75 million shares of its stock when the market price of the Company's stock is not reflective of management's opinion of an appropriate valuation of the stock. Management believes that repurchasing shares under these conditions enhances shareholder value and helps the Company manage its targeted capital structure. As of August 31, 2000, a total of 735,800 shares had been purchased under this program. During fiscal 2000, the Company repurchased 27,200 shares of its stock for a total of $0.4 million.  The Company believes that the current cash balance, internally generated funds and existing credit facilities will provide adequate financing for capital expenditures, working capital, joint ventures, stock repurchases and debt service requirements for the next year. In the longer term, the Company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing.   FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Moreover, the Company may from time to time issue other forward looking statements. One can generally identify these forward-looking statements through the use of words such as "expect," "believe," and other words which convey a similar meaning. One can also identify these statements, as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They are likely to address the Company's business strategy, financial projections and results and global factors affecting the Company's financial prospects. Examples of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: supply and demand conditions; the Company's ability to mitigate the effects of lower cost imports; fiscal policy in both the U.S. and abroad; competitive factors and pricing pressures from national steel companies; supply and availability of unprocessed metals; fluctuations in recycled metals prices; seasonality of results; and assumptions surrounding the tax provision such as the timing and use of tax credits, utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the general profitability of the Company's operations. One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the Company's forward looking statements. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. Further, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.   ITEM 7(a).        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates. Because such derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent incremental risk to the Company. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to "FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS" in Note 1 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.  As discussed in "Note 4 - Long-Term Debt" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the Company was committed to interest rate swaps on a revolving credit facility at August 31, 2000. If market rates would have averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal 2000 or fiscal 1999, the effect on the Company's interest expense and net income, after considering the effects of the interest rate swaps, would not have been material.                                      29                           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
