ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This section includes a discussion of our operations for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2020 and 2019. The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 of this report and the Selected Financial Data contained in Part II, Item 6 of this report.  For discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2018 including comparison to fiscal 2019 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 24, 2019.  Business  Founded in 1906, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (“SSI”), an Oregon corporation, is one of North America’s largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products.  Our internal organizational and reporting structure includes two operating and reportable segments: the Auto and Metals Recycling (“AMR”) business and the Cascade Steel and Scrap (“CSS”) business.  We use segment operating income to measure our segment performance. We do not allocate corporate interest income and expense, income taxes and other income and expense to our segments. Certain expenses related to shared services that support operational activities and transactions are allocated from Corporate to the segments. Unallocated Corporate expense consists primarily of expense for management and certain administrative services that benefit both segments. In addition, we do not allocate certain items to segment operating income because management does not include the information in its measurement of the performance of the segments. Such unallocated items include restructuring charges and other exit-related activities, charges (net of recoveries) related to legacy environmental matters and provisions for certain legal matters. Because of the unallocated income and expense, the operating income of each segment does not reflect the operating income the segment would report as a stand-alone business. The results of discontinued operations are excluded from segment operating income and are presented separately, net of tax, from the results of ongoing operations for all periods presented.  In April 2020, we announced our intention to modify our internal organizational and reporting structure to a functionally based, integrated model. We will consolidate our operations, sales, services and other functional capabilities at an enterprise level. This change in structure is intended to result in a more agile organization and solidify recent productivity improvement and cost reduction initiatives. We expect to complete this transition in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 resulting in a single operating and reportable segment.  See Note 18 - Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information regarding our current reportable segments, including a discussion of the primary activities of each reportable segment, total assets by reportable segment, operating results from continuing operations by reportable segment, revenues from external customers and concentration of sales to foreign countries.  Our results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and on the supply of raw materials, including end-of-life vehicles, available to be processed at our facilities. We respond to changes in selling prices for processed metal by seeking to adjust purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal in order to manage the impact on our operating income. We believe we generally benefit from sustained periods of stable or rising recycled scrap metal selling prices, which allow us to better maintain or increase both operating income and unprocessed scrap metal flow into our facilities. When recycled scrap metal selling prices decline, either sharply or for a sustained period, our operating margins typically compress.  Our deep water port facilities on both the East and West Coasts of the U.S. (in Everett, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Portland, Oregon) and access to public deep water port facilities (in Kapolei, Hawaii and Salinas, Puerto Rico) allow us to efficiently meet the global demand for recycled ferrous metal by enabling us to ship bulk cargoes to steel manufacturers located in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, North America, Central America and South America. Our exports of nonferrous recycled metal are shipped in containers through various public docks to specialty steelmakers, foundries, aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and smelters, brass and bronze ingot manufacturers, wire and cable producers, wholesalers, and other recycled metal processors globally. We also transport both ferrous and nonferrous metals by truck, rail and barge in order to transfer scrap metal between our facilities for further processing, to load shipments at our export facilities, and to meet regional domestic demand.  34  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           Our results of operations also depend on the demand and prices for our finished steel products, the manufacture of which uses internally sourced ferrous recycled scrap metal as the primary feedstock, as well as other raw materials. Our steel mill in Oregon sells to industrial customers primarily in North America.  Our quarterly operating results fluctuate based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, changes in market conditions for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal and finished steel products, the supply of scrap metal in our domestic markets, and varying demand for used auto parts from our self-service retail stores. Certain of these factors are influenced, to a degree, by the impact of seasonal changes including severe weather conditions, which can impact the timing of shipments and inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal collection at our facilities and production levels in our yards, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Further, trade actions, including tariffs and any retaliation by affected countries, and licensing and inspection requirements can impact the level of profitability on sales of our products and, in certain cases, impede or restrict our ability to sell to certain export markets or require us to direct our sales to alternative market destinations, which can cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. For further information regarding the potential impact of changing conditions in global markets including the impact of sanctions and tariffs, quotas and other trade actions and import restrictions on our business and results of operations, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.  Strategic Priorities  As we continue to closely monitor economic conditions, we remain focused on the following core strategies and plans to meet our business goals and objectives:          •   Long-term expansion of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal supply and processing, sales volumes and operating margins;          •   Technology investments and process improvements to increase the separation and recovery of recycled materials from our shredding process and to expand product optionality;          •   Development of new products and expansion of recycling services and capabilities to reach a broader market, enhance customer value and increase operating margins;          •   Productivity and continuous improvement initiatives to ensure the safety of our employees, increase operating efficiency and effectiveness, advance sustainable business practices, improve natural resource stewardship, and reduce operating expense;          •   Use of our seven deep water ports and ground-based logistics network to directly access customers domestically and internationally to meet demand for our products wherever it is greatest;          •   Further optimization of our integrated recycling and steel manufacturing operating platforms to maximize opportunities for synergies, cost efficiencies and volumes; and          •   Increase market share through initiatives to maximize volumes and through selective partnerships, alliances and acquisitions.  Key economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate  We sell recycled metals to the global steel industry for the production of finished steel. Our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the U.S. and Western Canada and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for finished steel products in the Western U.S. Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the economic cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and nonresidential and infrastructure construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. Global economic conditions, including impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic discussed below in this section, changes in supply and demand conditions, the strength of the U.S. dollar, the availability and price of raw material alternatives, and trade actions such as tariffs affect market prices for and sales volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and steel products in the Western U.S. and can have a significant impact on the results of operations for our reportable segments.  In fiscal 2020, operating results at AMR decreased significantly compared to fiscal 2019 as weaker market conditions resulted in declining commodity prices and lower sales prices and volumes for our recycled metal products compared to the prior year. AMR experienced operating margin compression in fiscal 2020 as declining average net selling prices for our recycled metal products outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials. Market conditions for recycled metals weakened entering fiscal 2020 due to softer demand for finished steel globally at the time and structural changes to the market for certain recycled nonferrous products resulting primarily from Chinese import restrictions and tariffs. Market selling prices for ferrous recycled metal declined by approximately $60 per ton, or approximately 20%, between the beginning of August 2019 and October 2019, before recovering moderately during the remainder of the first half of fiscal 2020. Global economic conditions deteriorated significantly beginning in March 2020 in large part due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in weaker market conditions for recycled metals and steel products. Market selling prices for ferrous recycled metal declined by approximately $70 per ton, or approximately 25%, in March   35  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           2020 . The sharply declining price environment in combination with economic and other restrictions on suppliers relating to COVID-19 severely constricted the supply of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, which resulted in significantly lower processed volumes and a substantial adverse impact on operating margins and overall operating results at AMR. Market selling prices for ferrous recycled metal began to recover in May 2020 and continued to improve through the end of fiscal 2020 , resulting in stronger demand for our products  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020  compared  to the prior quarter .  In fiscal 2019, market conditions for recycled metals weakened primarily due to slower global economic growth and the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures, resulting in lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal products and lower ferrous export sales volumes compared to fiscal 2018. Operating results at AMR in fiscal 2019 decreased significantly compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our recycled metal products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials. Domestic ferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2019 increased compared to the prior year, reflecting strong demand in the U.S. market particularly during the first half of fiscal 2019, partially offsetting the adverse impact of the weaker ferrous export market conditions and lower average net selling prices. Nonferrous average net selling prices in fiscal 2019 decreased significantly compared to fiscal 2018 primarily reflecting reduced demand for nonferrous products globally, as well as the continued impact of Chinese import restrictions and tariffs on certain nonferrous products put into place starting in the second half of fiscal 2018.  In fiscal 2020, CSS was impacted by an overall lower price environment for finished steel products compared to the prior year and, partially due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced sales of ferrous recycled scrap metal . The  effects of COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on sales volumes for our finished steel products as demand in West Coast construction markets remained steady.  In fiscal 2019, CSS benefited from reduced pressure from steel imports and higher net selling prices for finished steel products particularly during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, resulting in higher finished steel margins in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. However, these benefits were more than offset by lower finished steel and recycled metal sales volumes and increased steel-making consumables costs compared to fiscal 2018, resulting in lower operating results at CSS year-over-year.  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”)  In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The outbreak resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, followed by phased regulations and guidelines for reopening communities and economies. In addition, governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of COVID-19. For example, on March 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed and enacted into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, a $2 trillion economic relief bill aimed at supporting individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic and economic downturn. See “Income Taxes” within Results of Operations below in this Item 7 for discussion of the impact of the CARES Act on our accounting for income taxes.  We are a company operating in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Consistent with federal guidelines and with state and local orders to date, we have continued to operate across our footprint throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the health and welfare of our employees, and all who visit our sites, is our top priority and we are following all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health department guidelines. Further, we implemented infection control measures at all our sites and put in place restrictions on travel and in-person meetings and other physical distancing measures. Notwithstanding our continued operations, COVID-19 has negatively impacted and may have further unfavorable impacts on our financial performance, operations, supply chain and flows of raw materials, transportation and logistics networks and customers. Due in large part to the impacts of and response to the spread of COVID-19, global economic conditions declined sharply during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, resulting in historic unemployment levels, rapid changes in supply and demand in certain industry sectors, businesses switching to remote work or ceasing operations, and consumers eliminating, restricting or redirecting spending. The economic downturn adversely affected demand for our products and contributed to weaker supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products, services and raw  materials. Global economic conditions partially recovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, resulting in improved demand for our products compared to the third quarter.  During fiscal 2020, in particular the third quarter, our operations, margins and results were adversely impacted by lower sales volumes of recycled metals driven by severely constrained supplies of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, leading to lower processed volumes at our recycling facilities. We also experienced significant decreases in selling prices for our recycled metal products, softer demand, supply chain disruptions, reduced availability of shipping containers, and other logistics constraints.   36  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           While we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. For further discussion of  the risks related to  this matter, refer to Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A   of  this report.  Executive Overview of Financial Results  We generated  consolidated revenues of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020, a decrease of 20% from the $2.1 billion of consolidated revenues generated in fiscal 2019, primarily due to significantly lower average net selling prices for our ferrous, nonferrous and finished steel products, and reduced ferrous and nonferrous sales volumes compared to the prior year. These decreases were driven by weaker market conditions for recycled metals and steel products compared to the prior year including as a result of the sharp decline in global economic conditions during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Market selling prices for ferrous recycled metal declined sharply by approximately $70 per ton, or approximately 25%, in March 2020, before gradually recovering through the end of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2020, the average net selling prices for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal at AMR were 18% and 7% lower, respectively, compared to the prior year. Steel revenues in fiscal 2020 decreased by 8% compared to the prior year reflecting the impact of lower average net selling prices for our finished steel products partially offset by higher finished steel sales volumes compared to the prior year.  Consolidated operating  income  was  $7 million   in fiscal 2020, compared to $84 million in fiscal 2019. Adjusted consolidated operating income was $27 million in fiscal 2020, compared to  $89 million  in fiscal 2019. See the reconciliation of adjusted consolidated operating income in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7.  AMR reported operating income in fiscal 2020 of  $34 million ,  compared to  $96 million  in the prior year period . The decrease in AMR operating results in fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of  operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials . AMR’s fiscal 2020 operating margins and overall operating results were adversely impacted by periods of sharply declining commodity prices and reduced scrap metal supply flows due to weaker market conditions for recycled metals, including during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 in large part due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Market selling prices for ferrous recycled metal began to recover in May 2020 and continued to improve through the end of fiscal 2020 , resulting in stronger demand for our products and improved scrap metal supply flows in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the prior quarter. The adverse effects of the market conditions on AMR’s operating results in fiscal 2020 were partially offset by benefits from productivity and restructuring initiatives implemented during the year.  CSS reported operating income of  $23 million  in fiscal 2020, compared to $32 million in the prior year, with the decrease primarily reflecting the impact of the lower price environment compared to the prior year. Finished steel average net selling prices in fiscal  2020  declined  $83  per ton, or 12%, compared to the prior year, the adverse effects of which were partially offset by higher finished steel sales volumes and benefits from productivity initiatives compared to the prior year.  Consolidated selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)  expense in fiscal 2020 decreased by $4 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year primarily driven by lower employee-related expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives and reduced travel resulting from restrictions due to COVID-19, partially offset by higher legacy and other environmental-related expenses.  Net loss from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders in fiscal 2020 was $(4) million, or  $(0.15)  per diluted share, compared to income of $57 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders in fiscal 2020 was  $12 million , or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to  $61 million , or $2.16   per diluted share, in the prior year. See the reconciliation of adjusted net (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders and adjusted diluted (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7.  The following items further highlight selected liquidity and capital structure metrics:          •   Net cash provided by operating activities  of $125 million  in fiscal 2020, compared to $145 million in the prior year;          •   Debt of $104 million as of August 31, 2020, compared to $105 million as of the prior year-end;          •   Debt, net of cash, of  $87 million  as of August 31, 2020, compared to $93 million as of the prior year-end (see the reconciliation of debt, net of cash, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7).     37  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.

AMR Segment Revenues  Revenues in fiscal 2020 decreased by 22% compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to significantly lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products, and reduced sales volumes when compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease was driven by weaker market conditions for recycled metals when compared to the prior year, including as a result of the sharp decline in global economic conditions during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 due in large part to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonferrous revenues in fiscal 2020 decreased by 16% compared to the prior year, as average net selling prices decreased by 7% compared to fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting structural changes to the market for certain recycled nonferrous products resulting primarily from Chinese import restrictions and tariffs.  39  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           AMR Segment Operating Income  Operating income for fiscal 2020 was $34 million, compared to $96 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease in AMR operating results in fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of operating margin compression from the decline in average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products which outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials. AMR’s fiscal 2020 operating margins and overall operating results were adversely impacted by periods of sharply declining commodity prices experienced during the first and third quarters of fiscal 2020, due to weaker market conditions for recycled metals. Market conditions partially recovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, resulting in a moderate improvement in sales volumes and net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products compared to the third quarter and an increase in scrap metal supply flows.  Ferrous metal spreads at AMR in fiscal 2020 and average net selling prices for its nonferrous joint products that are recovered from the shredding process, comprising primarily zorba, declined by approximately 16% and 11%, respectively, compared to the prior year. The lower price environment in combination with the impact of economic slowdowns and other restrictions on suppliers relating to COVID-19 also severely constricted the supply of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, primarily in the third quarter, which resulted in lower processed volumes compared to the prior year. The lower average ferrous and nonferrous selling prices in fiscal 2020 also reflected the effects of tariffs and other regulatory measures on demand for recycled metals in our export markets, the weaker price environment for recycled metals in our domestic markets, and reduced demand for nonferrous products globally. The adverse effects of the market conditions on AMR’s operating results in fiscal 2020 were partially offset by positive contributions from increased sales revenues from higher priced PGM products compared to the prior year and benefits from productivity and restructuring initiatives implemented subsequent to the prior year. AMR SG&A expense in fiscal 2020 decreased by $1 million, or 1%, compared to the end of the prior year primarily due to lower employee-related and advertising expenses, partially offset by higher charges related to environmental matters. Operating results at AMR in fiscal 2019 included $20 million in positive contributions from a limited-duration contract, which was substantially complete at the end of fiscal 2019, and which had provided a high margin source of supply.

CSS Segment Revenues  Revenues in fiscal 2020 decreased by $46 million, or 10%, compared to fiscal 2019 primarily reflecting lower average net selling prices for our finished steel products and,  partially due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,  decreased sales of ferrous recycled scrap metal, partially offset by increased finished steel sales volumes. Sales volumes for our finished steel products in fiscal 2020 were not significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 primarily due to steady demand in West Coast construction markets. The higher average net selling prices for our finished steel products in the prior year reflected the impacts of reduced pressure from steel imports and higher steel-making raw material costs at the time.  40  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           CSS Segment Operating Income  Operating income for fiscal 2020 was $23 million, compared to operating income of $32 million in the prior year. Decreased operating results in fiscal 2020 primarily reflected the impact of the lower price environment for finished steel compared to the prior year and decreased sales of ferrous recycled scrap metal compared to fiscal 2019, partially due to the weaker market conditions for recycled metals as a result of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finished steel average net selling prices in fiscal 2020 declined 12% compared to the prior year, the adverse effects of which were partially offset by reduced raw material purchase prices and other input costs and the benefits from productivity initiatives compared to the prior year.  Corporate  Corporate SG&A expense decreased by $2 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year primarily due to lower employee-related expenses as a result of reduced incentive compensation accruals and cost savings initiatives, and reduced travel resulting from restrictions due to COVID-19, partially offset by increased charges related to legacy environmental matters.  Productivity Initiatives and Restructuring Charges  In fiscal 2020, we implemented productivity initiatives aimed at further reducing our annual operating expenses at Corporate, AMR and CSS, mainly through reductions in non-trade procurement spend, including outside and professional services, lower employee-related expenses and other non-headcount measures. We targeted $15 million in realized benefits in fiscal 2020 from these additional initiatives, and we exceeded this target with achievement of approximately $18 million of benefits in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2019, we also implemented productivity initiatives aimed at delivering $35 million in annual benefits primarily through a combination of production cost efficiencies and reductions in SG&A expense. We achieved approximately $30 million in benefits as a result of these initiatives in fiscal 2019 and achieved the full run rate of benefits in fiscal 2020.  In April 2020, we announced our intention to modify our  internal organizational and reporting structure to a functionally based, integrated model. This change in structure is intended to result in a more agile organization and solidify recent productivity improvement and cost reduction initiatives. We expect to complete this transition in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.  During fiscal 2020, we incurred aggregate restructuring charges and other exit-related costs of approximately $9 million in connection with these initiatives, comprising severance costs of $2 million, costs associated with a lease contract termination of $1 million and professional services costs of $6 million. The substantial majority of the restructuring charges and other exit-related costs related to these initiatives were recognized in fiscal 2020 and required us to make cash payments.  Income Taxes                 Year Ended August 31,                 2020           2019           2018         (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes       $   (1,939   )       $   76,240           $   141,853         Income tax (expense) benefit       $   (166   )       $   (17,670   )       $   17,590         Effective tax rate           (8.6   )%           23.2   %           (12.4   )%    Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was an expense of 8.6%, compared to 23.2% for fiscal 2019.   Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, and reflective of income tax expense on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations, primarily due to the partially offsetting impacts of individually immaterial permanent differences from non-deductible expenses and research and development credits, the effects of unrecognized tax benefits and the aggregate impact of state taxes.  We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. We continue to maintain valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets related to certain jurisdictions as a result of negative objective evidence, including the effects of historical losses in these tax jurisdictions, outweighing positive objective and subjective evidence, indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that the associated tax benefit will not be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the associated tax jurisdictions in future years to benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from the utilization of net operating losses. We will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets. Changes in historical earnings performance and future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause us to adjust our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which would impact our results of operations in the period we determine that these factors have changed.  41  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           CARES  Act  On March 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed and enacted into law the CARES Act, which contains several income tax provisions, as well as other measures, aimed at assisting businesses impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other provisions, the CARES Act removes certain limitations on utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”) and allows for carrybacks of certain past and future NOLs. We applied the NOL carryback provisions of the CARES Act to our NOL for fiscal 2020, which resulted in the reclassification of a $11 million NOL deferred income tax asset to refundable income taxes and recognition of a $1 million income tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We do not anticipate the other income tax provisions of the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial statements.  See Note 14 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion.     Liquidity and Capital Resources  We rely on cash provided by operating activities as a primary source of liquidity, supplemented by current cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.  Sources and Uses of Cash  We had cash balances of $18 million and $12 million as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash balances are intended to be used primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions. We use excess cash on hand to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. As of August 31, 2020, debt  was $104 million, compared  to $105 million as of August 31, 2019, and debt, net of cash , was $87 million  as of August 31, 2020 compared to $93 million as of August 31, 2019 (see the reconciliation of debt, net of cash, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7).  Operating Activities  Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 was  $125 million , compared to $145 million in fiscal 2019.  Sources of cash in fiscal 2020 included a  $39 million  decrease in inventories due to lower raw material purchase prices and the timing of purchases and sales and a  $13 million  increase in accrued payroll and related liabilities due to increased incentive compensation  liabilities and deferred payroll taxes as permitted under the CARES Act. Uses  of cash in fiscal 2020 included an  $8 million  decrease in accounts payable primarily due to lower raw material purchase prices and the timing of payments.  Sources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2019 included a $33 million decrease in inventories due to lower raw material purchase prices and timing of payments and sales and a $9 million decrease in accounts receivable due to lower selling prices and the timing of sales and collections. Uses of cash in fiscal 2019 included a $19 million decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to incentive compensation payments made in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and a $17 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to lower raw material purchase prices and the timing of payments.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020  was $79 million, compared to $90 million in fiscal 2019.  Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 included capital expenditures of $82 million to  upgrade our equipment and infrastructure and for additional investments in nonferrous processing technologies and environmental and safety-related assets, compared to $95 million in the prior year. The significant majority of capital expenditures were associated with projects at AMR.  Financing Activities  Net cash used in financing activities for  fiscal 2020 was $41 million, compared with  $47 million in fiscal 2019.  Uses of cash in both fiscal 2020 and 2019  included $21 million for the payment of dividends and $1 million and $13 million , respectively, for share repurchases. Uses of cash in fiscal 2020 also included $8 million in net repayments of debt, compared  to $4 million in  the prior year (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7). Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we borrowed an incremental $250 million under our credit facilities in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. We repaid the $250 million of additional borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.  42  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           Debt  Following is a summary of our outstanding balances and availability on credit facilities and long-term debt, exclusive of finance lease obligations (in thousands):                 Outstanding as of  August 31, 2020           Remaining  Availability         Bank secured revolving credit facilities (1)       $   90,000           $   611,489         Other debt obligations       $   6,911           N/A               (1)   Remaining availability is net  of $10 million of outstanding  stand-by letters of credit as of August 31, 2020.  Our senior secured revolving credit facilities, which provide for revolving loans of $700 million and C$15 million, mature in August 2023 pursuant to a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. The $700 million credit facility includes a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit, a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $50 million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings. As of August 31, 2020, interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement were based, at our option, on either the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (or the Canadian equivalent for C$ loans), plus a spread of between 1.25% and 3.50%, with the amount of the spread based on a pricing grid tied to our ratio of consolidated funded debt to EBITDA (as defined by the credit agreement), or the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (c) the daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, in each case, plus a spread of between 0.00% and 2.50% based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the credit facilities at rates between 0.20% and 0.50% based on a pricing grid tied to our ratio of consolidated funded debt to EBITDA.  On June 30, 2020,  in large part due to the uncertainties resulting from the effects of COVID-19, we  entered into an amendment to our existing credit agreement   with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party  thereto.  The principal changes to the existing credit agreement effected by the amendment are (i) the reduction of the consolidated fixed charge coverage from a minimum ratio of 1.50 to 1.00 to a minimum ratio of 1.20 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending August 31, 2020, and to a minimum ratio of 1.10 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending November 30, 2020, February 28, 2021 and May 31, 2021, and (ii) the introduction of a minimum consolidated asset coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 for each of the fiscal quarters ending August 31, 2020 through May 31, 2021. The amendment further provides for revisions to the definition of LIBOR to include a 0.50% floor and mechanics by which the parties may replace the benchmark interest rate used in the agreement from LIBOR to one or more rates based on the secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  We had borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities of $90 million and $97 million as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facilities was  4.59%  and 3.78% as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  We use the credit facilities to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions. Our credit agreement contains various representations and warranties, events of default and financial and other customary covenants which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. The financial covenants under the credit agreement include (a) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the four-quarter rolling sum of consolidated EBITDA less defined maintenance capital expenditures and certain environmental expenditures divided by consolidated fixed charges, (b) a consolidated leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded indebtedness divided by the sum of consolidated net worth and consolidated funded indebtedness, and (c) a consolidated asset coverage ratio, defined as consolidated asset values divided by consolidated funded indebtedness.  As of August 31, 2020,  we were in compliance with  the financial covenants under our credit agreement. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was required to be no less than 1.20 to 1.00 and was  2.17  to 1.00 as of August 31, 2020. The consolidated leverage ratio was required to be no more than  0.55 to 1.00  and was  0.14  to  1.00  as of August 31, 2020. The consolidated asset coverage ratio was required to be no less than 1.00 to 1.00 and was 2.71 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2020.   43  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           Our obligations under our credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. The credit facilities and the related guarantees are secured by senior first priority liens on certain of our and our subsidiaries’ assets, including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable.  While we currently expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement, we may not be able to do so in the event market conditions,  COVID-19 or  other negative factors have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. If we do not maintain compliance with our financial covenants and are unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from our lenders, a breach of a financial covenant would constitute an event of default and allow the lenders to exercise remedies under the agreements, the most severe of which is the termination of the credit facility under our committed bank credit agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed under the agreement. In such case, we would be required to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain alternative funds. We cannot assure that any such alternative funds, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.  Other debt obligations primarily relate to an equipment purchase, the contract consideration for which includes an obligation to make future monthly payments to the vendor in the form of licensing fees. For accounting purposes, such obligation is treated as a partial financing of the purchase price by the equipment vendor. Monthly payments commence when the equipment is placed in service and continue for a period of four years thereafter. We impute interest on this obligation at a rate of 4.25% reflecting the estimated rate that would be recorded in a market transaction with similar terms.  Capital Expenditures  Capital expenditures totaled  $82 million  for fiscal 2020, compared to $95 million for fiscal 2019. Capital expenditures in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 were primarily to upgrade our equipment , facilities and infrastructure, and for additional investments in nonferrous processing technologies and environmental and safety-related assets. We currently plan to invest up to $125 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2021, including approximately $65 million for investments in growth, including new nonferrous processing technologies and to support volume initiatives and  other growth projects, using cash generated from operations and available credit facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused some delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects, including delays in obtaining permits from government agencies, resulting in the deferral of certain capital expenditures to fiscal 2021. Given the continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which forecasted capital expenditures could be further deferred is uncertain.  Environmental Compliance  Building on our commitment to recycling and operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner, we continue to invest in facilities that improve our environmental presence in the communities in which we operate. As part of our capital expenditures discussed in the prior paragraph, we  invested $10 million and $36 million for envi ronmental projects in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. We plan to invest in the range  of $24 million of our planned  capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal 2021. These projects include investments in storm water systems and equipment to ensure ongoing compliance with air quality and other environmental regulations.  We have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as one of the potentially responsible parties that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site (the “Site”). See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of this matter, as well as other legacy environmental loss contingencies. We believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with the Site, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We have insurance policies that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remediation and mitigation for natural resource damages claims in connection with the Site, although there are no assurances that those policies will cover all of the costs which we may incur. Significant cash outflows in the future related to the Site could reduce the amounts available for borrowing that could otherwise be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions and could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements, and could adversely impact our liquidity.  44  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           Dividends  On  July 31,  2020, our Board of Directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 of $0.1875 per common share, which equates to an annual cash dividend of $0.75 per common share . Dividends of $0.75 per common share, totaling $21 million, were declared and paid during fiscal  2020 .   On October 20, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 of $0.1875 per common share payable November 16, 2020 to shareholders of record on November 2, 2020.     Share Repurchase Program  Pursuant to our share repurchase program as amended in 2001, 2006 and 2008,   we were authorized to repurchase up to nine million shares of our Class A common stock. As of August 31, 2020, we have authorization to repurchase up to a remaining  706 thousand shares of our Class  A common stock when we deem such repurchases to be appropriate. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as to optimize our capital structure and to offset dilution related to share-based compensation arrangements. We consider several factors in determining whether to make share repurchases including, among other factors, our cash needs, the availability of funding, our future business plans and the market price of our stock. As of the beginning of fiscal 2019, we had repurchased approximately  7.7 million  shares of our Class A common stock under the program. We repurchased approximately 527  thousand shares for a total of $13 million in open-market transactions in fiscal 2019, and approximately 53 thousand shares for a total of $0.9 million in open-market transactions in fiscal 2020.  Assessment of Liquidity and Capital Resources  Historically, our available cash resources, internally generated funds, credit facilities and equity offerings have financed our acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other financing needs.  We generally believe our current cash resources, internally generated funds, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide adequate short-term and long-term liquidity needs for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions, joint ventures, debt service requirements, environmental obligations and other contingencies. However, in the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need to evaluate alternative sources of liquidity and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds. There can be no assurances that any such supplemental funding, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  None requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

For accounting purposes, such obligation is treated as a partial financing of the purchase price by the equipment vendor. Monthly p ayments commence when the equipment is placed in service and continue for a period of four years  thereafter .      (4)   Operating lease payments reflect those embedded in the measurement of our operating lease liabilities and, thus, include future lease payments for the remaining non-cancellable period of the lease together with periods covered by renewal (or termination) options which we are reasonably certain to exercise (or not to exercise).      ( 5 )   Purchase obligations include all enforceable, legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms, regardless of the duration of the agreement.      ( 6 )   Other contractual obligations consist of pension funding obligations and other accrued liabilities.  We maintain stand-by letters of credit to provide support for certain obligations, including workers’ compensation and performance bonds. At August 31, 2020, we had $10 million outstanding under these arrangements.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We deem critical accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.  Our critical accounting estimates include those related to inventories, long-lived assets, leases, goodwill, environmental costs, and income taxes.  Inventories  Our inventories consist of processed and unprocessed scrap metal (ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed nonferrous recovered joint products arising from the manufacturing process), semi-finished steel products (billets), finished steel products (primarily rebar, wire rod, and merchant bar), used and salvaged vehicles, and supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We consider estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value of our inventory. As we generally sell our recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, we utilize the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated net realizable value of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and sales orders.  The accounting process we use to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, we rely on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments by management. Actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal. The Company’s estimates are intended to reasonably reflect the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal that are used in the production of processed ferrous metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates, we periodically review shrink factors and perform monthly physical inventories. Due to the inherent nature of our scrap metal inventories, including variations in product density, holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the products, physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances for scrap metal inventory such that estimates of quantities are required. To mitigate this risk, we further adjust our ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count is deemed to more accurately estimate the remaining volume.  Long-Lived Assets  We test long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is determined based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Operating lease right-of-use assets are considered long-lived assets subject to this impairment testing. For our metals recycling operations reported within AMR, an asset group generally consists of the regional shredding and export operation along with surrounding feeder yards. For regions with no shredding and export operations, each metals recycling yard is an asset group. For our auto parts operations, generally each auto parts store is an asset group. The combined steel manufacturing and metals recycling operations within CSS are a single asset group. We test our asset groups for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. If the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable because it exceeds the estimate of   46  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized by the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value, if any. The impairment loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. Fair value is determined using  one or more of the income, market or  cost approaches , depending on the nature of the asset group .  Determination of fair value is considered a critical accounting estimate.  Leases  We determine whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception by assessing whether the Company receives the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from use of the underlying asset. Lease classification, measurement, and recognition are determined at lease commencement, which is the date the underlying asset is available for use by the Company. The accounting classification of a lease is based on whether the arrangement is effectively a financed purchase of the underlying asset (finance lease) or not (operating lease). Leases that, at lease commencement, have a non-cancellable lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to either purchase the underlying asset or renew the lease beyond 12 months that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise are classified as short-term leases and are not recognized on the balance sheet.  For leases other than short-term leases, we recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities based primarily on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset during the lease term, while lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make future lease payments. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with periods covered by renewal (or termination) options which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise (or not to exercise). Determination of the lease term is considered a critical accounting estimate. Lease payments are discounted to present value using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, unless the discount rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate for each lease is the estimated rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow the aggregate lease payments on a collateralized basis over the lease term. Estimation of the incremental borrowing rate is considered a critical accounting estimate as it requires judgment by management and reflects an assessment of the Company’s credit standing to derive an implied secured credit rating and corresponding yield curve. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate to recognize all operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities as of the new lease accounting standard application date. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are subject to remeasurement after lease commencement when certain events or changes in circumstances arise, such as a change in the lease term due to reassessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise a renewal or termination option.  For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the lease right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis and interest expense is recognized on the lease liability using the effective interest rate method. Many of the Company’s real property leases contain variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, which are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability using the index or rate at lease commencement, or with respect to the Company’s transition to the new lease accounting standard the index or rate at the application date. Subsequent changes in variable lease payments are recorded as variable lease expenses during the period in which they are incurred. The Company elected a practical expedient to not separate lease and related non-lease components for accounting purposes and, thus, costs related to such non-lease components are disclosed as lease expense. Payments for short-term leases are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Goodwill  We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a ‘component’).  When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more-likely-than-not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. When performing the quantitative impairment test, we apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  47  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           We estimate the fair value of  a  reporting unit using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) determined separately for  the  reporting unit. To estimate the present value of the cash flows that extend beyond the final year  in  the discounted cash flow  analysis , we employ a terminal value technique, whereby we use estimated operating cash flows minus capital expenditures, adjust for changes in working capital requirements in the final year of the  analysis , and then discount these estimated cash flows by the WACC to establish the terminal value.  The determination of fair value using the income approach requires judgment and involves the use of estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future ferrous and nonferrous commodity price and sales volume expectations, gross margins,  selling, general and administrative expense relative to total revenues,  capital expenditures, working capital requirements, discount rate (WACC), tax rate, terminal growth rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergistic benefits available to market participants.  We also use a market approach based on earnings multiple data and our Company’s market capitalization to corroborate our reporting units’ valuations. We reconcile the Company’s market capitalization to the aggregated estimated fair value of all reporting units, including consideration of a control premium representing the estimated amount a market participant would pay to obtain a controlling interest in the Company.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of  July 1, 2020 . As of the testing date, the balance of our goodwill  was $169 million, and all but $1 million of such balance was carried by a single reporting unit within AMR. We had last performed the quantitative impairment test of goodwill carried by this reporting unit in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 using a measurement date of February 1, 2016. Based on the changes in market conditions related to the general economy and the metals recycling industry and the increase in the carrying amount of the reporting unit since the last quantitative impairment test, we elected not to perform the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit and, instead, proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test. For the reporting unit within AMR subject to the quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 29% as of July 1, 2020. The projections used in the income approach for the reporting unit took into consideration the impact of current market conditions for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metals, the cost of obtaining adequate supply flows of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, and recent trends in retail auto parts sales. The projections assumed a limited recovery of operating margins from current levels over a multi-year period. The WACC used in the income approach valuation for the reporting unit was 11.1%, and the terminal growth rate used was 2.0%. Assuming all other components of the fair value estimate were held constant, an increase in the WACC of 228 basis points or more or weaker than anticipated improvements in operating margins could have resulted in a failure of the quantitative impairment test for the reporting unit. See Note 7 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail.  As a result of the inherent uncertainty associated with forming the estimates described above, actual results could differ from those estimates. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to future revenue and operating margin growth, WACC and other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of the reporting units’ fair value. Although we believe the assumptions used in testing our reporting units’ goodwill for impairment are reasonable, a lack of recovery or further deterioration in market conditions from current levels, a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for the reporting unit with allocated goodwill, a decline in our share price from current levels for a sustained period of time, or an increase in the WACC, among other factors, could significantly impact our impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  48  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           Environmental Costs  We operate in industries that inherently possess environmental risks. To manage these risks, we employ both our own environmental staff and outside consultants. Environmental management and finance personnel meet regularly to discuss environmental risks. We estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated but the timing of incurring the estimated costs is unknown. The regulatory and government management of these projects is complex, which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than any other, the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements. If further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these liabilities, the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated. Adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which accruals are established are made. The factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include:          •   Current regulations, both at the time the liability is established and during the course of the investigation or remediation process, which specify standards for acceptable remediation;          •   Information about the site which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated;          •   The professional judgment of senior level internal staff and outside consultants, who take into account similar, recent instances of environmental remediation issues, and studies of our sites, among other considerations;          •   Available technologies that can be used for remediation; and          •   The number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the costs of study and remediation.  Our accrued environmental liabilities as of August 31, 2020 included $4 million related to the Portland Harbor Superfund site. Because the final remedial actions have not yet been designed and  there has not been a determination of the amount of natural resource damages or of the allocation among the potentially responsible parties of costs of the investigations, remedial action costs or natural resource damages, we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely or which it is reasonably possible that we may incur in connection with the Site, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Therefore, no additional amounts have been accrued. Further, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party at sites other than Portland Harbor which are currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities. See “Contingencies – Environmental” in Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.  Income Taxes  Valuation Allowances  We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. Due to the significant judgment involved, realizability of our deferred tax assets is considered a critical accounting estimate. In fiscal 2018,  we released valuation allowances against certain U.S. federal and state and Canadian deferred tax assets resulting in discrete tax benefits totaling $37 million. The  release of these valuation allowances was the result of sufficient positive evidence at the time, including cumulative income in recent years and projections of future taxable income based primarily on our improved financial performance, that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. We continue to maintain valuation allowances against certain state, Canadian and all Puerto Rican deferred tax assets.  49  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2020           SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.           Recently Issued Accounting Standards  We have not identified any recent accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  Debt, net of cash  Debt, net of cash is the difference between (i) the sum of long-term debt and short-term borrowings (i.e., total debt) and (ii) cash and cash equivalents. We believe that debt, net of cash is a useful measure for investors because, as cash and cash equivalents can be used, among other things, to repay indebtedness, netting this against total debt is a useful measure of our leverage.  The following is a reconciliation of debt, net of cash (in thousands):                 August 31, 2020           August 31, 2019           August 31, 2018         Short-term borrowings       $   2,184           $   1,321           $   1,139         Long-term debt, net of current maturities           102,235               103,775               106,237         Total debt           104,419               105,096               107,376         Less cash and cash equivalents           17,887               12,377               4,723         Total debt, net of cash       $   86,532           $   92,719           $   102,653           Net borrowings (repayments) of debt  Net borrowings (repayments) of debt is the sum of borrowings from long-term debt and repayments of long-term debt. We present this amount as the net change in our borrowings (repayments) for the period because we believe it is useful for investors as a meaningful presentation of the change in debt.

(2)   The income tax allocated to the aggregate adjustments reconciling reported and adjusted net (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders and diluted (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to SSI shareholders is determined based on a tax provision calculated with and without the adjustments.     We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures allow for a better understanding of our operating and financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Although we find these non-GAAP financial measures useful in evaluating the performance of our business, our reliance on these measures is limited because the adjustments often have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, we typically use these adjusted amounts in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results to address these limitations.  52  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Commodity Price Risk  We are exposed to commodity price risk, mainly associated with variations in the market price for ferrous and nonferrous metals, including scrap metal, finished steel products, auto bodies and other commodities. The timing and magnitude of industry cycles are difficult to predict and are impacted by general economic conditions. We respond to increases and decreases in forward selling prices by adjusting purchase prices. We actively manage our exposure to commodity price risk and monitor the actual and expected spread between forward selling prices and purchase costs and processing and shipping expense. Sales contracts are based on prices negotiated with our customers, and generally orders are placed 30 to 60 days ahead of shipment date. However, financial results may be negatively impacted when forward selling prices fall more quickly than we can adjust purchase prices or when customers fail to meet their contractual obligations. We assess the net realizable value of inventory (“NRV”) each quarter based upon committed contracts and sales orders and estimated future selling prices. For our uncommitted inventories, a  10% decrease  in the selling price of  inventory would not have had a material NRV impact on any of our reportable segments as of August 31, 2020 and  2019.  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt obligations. Our revolving credit facility is subject to variable interest rates and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates. If market interest rates had  changed 10%  from actual interest rate levels in fiscal 2020 or 2019, the effect on our interest expense and net income  would not have been material.  Credit Risk  Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that might occur as a result of non-performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to take delivery of scrap metal and finished steel products and to make financial settlements of these obligations, or to provide sufficient quantities of scrap metal or payment to settle advances, loans and other contractual receivables in connection with demolition and scrap extraction projects. We manage our exposure to credit risk through a variety of methods, including shipping ferrous scrap metal exports under letters of credit, collection of deposits prior to shipment for certain nonferrous export customers, establishment of credit limits for certain sales on open terms, credit insurance and designation of collateral and financial guarantees securing advances, loans and other contractual receivables. As a result of COVID-19, we have experienced reductions in the availability of credit insurance that we have historically used to cover a portion of our recycled metal and finished steel sales to domestic customers, which reduced availability may increase our exposure to customer credit risk.  Historically, we have shipped almost all of our large shipments of ferrous scrap metal to foreign customers under contracts supported by letters of credit issued or confirmed by banks deemed creditworthy. The letters of credit ensure payment by the customer. As we generally sell export recycled ferrous metal under contracts or orders that generally provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, our customers typically do not have difficulty obtaining letters of credit from their banks in periods of rising ferrous prices, as the value of the letters of credit are collateralized by the value of the inventory on the ship. However, in periods of significantly declining prices, our customers may not be able to obtain letters of credit for the full sales value of the inventory to be shipped.  As of August 31, 2020 and 2019, 40% and 32%, respectively, of our accounts receivable balance were covered by letters of credit. Of the remaining balance, 98% and 96% was less than 60 days past due as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, mainly associated with sales transactions and related accounts receivable denominated in the U.S. Dollar by our Canadian subsidiary with a functional currency of the Canadian Dollar. In certain instances, we may use derivatives to manage some portion of this risk. As of August 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any derivative contracts.     53  /  Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.
