ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  Results of Operations  The results of operations of the Company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products on the U.S. West Coast. Increasing steel demand and prices led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal 1995 through fiscal 1997. Primarily due to the Asian financial crisis, which severly curtailed demand and decreased prices, fiscal 1998 and 1999 results for the Metals Recycling Business were negatively impacted.  The Company acquired Proler, effective November 29, 1996.  The following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the Company's Metals Recycling Business and Steel Manufacturing Business, and the breakdown of income from operations between the Metals Recycling Business, the Steel Manufacturing Business and Joint Ventures. Additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)  Ferrous recycled metal sales from the Metals Recycling Business to the      Steel Manufacturing Business are made at a negotiated market rate per ton.  (3)  Corporate expense and eliminations consist primarily of unallocated      corporate expense for services that benefit both the Metals Recycling      Business and the Steel Manufacturing Business. Because of this unallocated      expense, the income from operations of each segment does not reflect the      income from operations the segment would have as a stand-alone business.    Fiscal 1999 Compared to Fiscal 1998  Revenues. Revenues for both the Metals Recycling Business and the Steel Manufacturing Business decreased resulting in an overall decline in consolidated revenues of $88.1 to $265.0 million for fiscal 1999 compared with $353.1 million for fiscal 1998. The Asian financial crisis which began during fiscal 1998 continued to impact the results of both operations in fiscal 1999.  The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $137.1 million, before intercompany eliminations, a decrease of $80.8 million (37%). Ferrous revenues declined $73.6 million (42%) to $101.7 million as a result of both lower volumes and lower average selling prices, both of which were primarily caused by the financial crisis in Asia. Ferrous volumes declined 211,000 tons (15%) while the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal declined $39 per ton (32%) to $83 per ton. The Metals Recycling Business made export shipments, aggregating 491,000 tons, during fiscal 1999 compared with export shipments totaling 720,000 tons during the prior year. Domestic third-party tonnage declined by 17% to 194,000 tons. Sales to the Company's Steel Business increased by 12% to 539,000 tons.  The Steel Manufacturing Business recognized revenues for fiscal 1999 of $172.7 million, a decrease of 10% from revenues recognized in the prior year. Although the volume of finished steel products sold increased, the average selling price per ton declined. Sales of finished steel products increased 3% to 571,000 tons. However, the average selling price declined $36 per ton (11%) to $303 per ton. The Company feels that the decline in average selling prices is attributable to the dumping of lower priced steel products by Asian companies on the West Coast. The decline in the average selling price is also partially due to a change in product mix. During fiscal 1999, the Steel Manufacturing Business shipped proportionately more lower-priced products than in the prior year. During fiscal 1998, the Company also sold 16,900 tons of billets, whereas in fiscal 1999, sales of billets aggregated 500 tons.                                         22                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   Cost of Goods Sold. Consolidated cost of goods sold declined $73.4 million (24%) to $236.3 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 88% in fiscal 1998 to 89% in fiscal 1999. Gross profit declined by $14.7 million (34%) to $28.8 million.  The Metals Recycling Business' cost of goods sold decreased $68.4 million to $119.2 million before intercompany eliminations. Cost of sales per ferrous ton declined, as the Company lowered the purchase price of recycled metals metals at the scale in response to declining selling prices, and sales volumes declined. However, because the average selling prices declined at a higher rate than the price of unprepared metal, gross profit for the Metals Recycling Business declined $12.5 million. The Metals Recycling Business did generate income from operations for fiscal 1999 of $4.6 million, despite the adverse international financial climate in which it operated during the year.  The Metals Recycling Business' cost of goods sold for the year ended August 31, 1999 was lowered by a $1.9 million reversal of environmental reserves. An independent consultant was engaged to review the Company's environmental issues and to determine its potential liabilities. Based upon the completion of certain projects at less than anticipated costs, certain previously established reserves were eliminated.  Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business declined $15.3 million (9%) despite higher volumes sold during fiscal 1999. Cost of sales per ton, excluding billets, declined by $30 per ton primarily due to lower recycled metals prices. The impact of lower average selling prices more than offset this decline in operating costs per ton, however, resulting in a gross profit of $10.0 million which was $3.3 million lower than in fiscal 1998.  Selling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses declined $0.3 million to $23.7 as the Company endeavored to contain overhead costs.  Income from Joint Ventures. The Company's joint ventures' revenues and results of operations were as follows:                                                                           Year Ended August 31,                                                                    ---------------------------                                                                        1999               1998                                                                    --------           --------      Total revenues from external customers recognized by:        Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business             $303,014           $332,580        Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                             46,575             51,391                                                                    --------           --------                                                                    $349,589           $383,971                                                                    ========           ========  Income from joint ventures recognized by the Company:        Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business             $  1,380           $    823        Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                              2,070              3,292                                                                    --------           --------                                                                    $  3,450           $  4,115                                                                    ========           ========   The Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business predominantly sell recycled ferrous metal. The decrease in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to lower ferrous selling prices, the impact of which was partially offset by an increase in tonnage shipped. Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to 2.5 million tons for the year ended August 31, 1999 from 2.3 million tons in the prior year. The increase in ferrous recycled metal was partially due to the fact that one of the joint ventures was organized during fiscal 1998 and, thus, fiscal 1998's results only reflect a portion of a year's sales. The average selling price of ferrous recycled metal declined during that period to $87 per ton from $117 per ton, predominantly due to the Asian financial crisis and a weaker domestic market which reduced demand in those countries that traditionally purchase a large share of the worldwide supply.                                         23                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   The Company's equity in income from the Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business for fiscal 1999 included the Company's $1.4 million share of a gain recognized by one of the joint ventures from the sale of property. Additionally, the results for fiscal 1999 also benefited from $3.3 million of LIFO and other inventory adjustments, compared with $2.2 million for the prior year.  Both revenues and income from the Joint Venture Suppliers of Metal declined from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999 primarily due to severe weather conditions in California during the first part of fiscal 1999 which impacted demand and, thus, results of the Company's joint venture which operates self-service used auto parts yards. Additionally, prices received for the auto bodies by this joint venture were lower than in the prior year due to weakness in the recycled metals markets.  Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $0.2 million due to increased average borrowings, the effect of which was partially offset by lower average interest rates. Average borrowings of $104.3 million in fiscal 1999 exceeded average borrowings in fiscal 1998 of $97.6 million. The average interest rate for fiscal 1999 was 5.4% compared with $5.8% for fiscal 1998.  Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets. During fiscal 1999, the Steel Manufacturing Business sold its Union City, California mill depot, resulting in a gain of $1.2 million. Fiscal 1998 results included a $2.2 million charge which reflected the estimated loss the Company expected to realize upon the sale of its older Tacoma shredders.  Other Income. Other income increased $2.3 million. During fiscal 1999, the Company received a $1 million settlement as a result of antitrust litigation related to graphite electrodes pricing. Also, the Company recognized additional interest income during fiscal 1999 of $.6 million.  Income Tax Provision. The Company's effective tax rate increased to 43% in fiscal 1999 from 38% in fiscal 1998. The increase was predominantly due to the lower taxable income relative to the amount of non-deductible goodwill amortization.   Fiscal 1998 Compared to Fiscal 1997  Revenues. Revenues for the Metals Recycling Business decreased, while revenues for the Steel Manufacturing Business increased, resulting in a net decrease in the Company's revenues of $8.6 million to $353.1 million for fiscal 1998 compared to $361.7 million for fiscal 1997. The Steel Manufacturing Business achieved record shipments of finished steel products and produced record tons of billets in fiscal 1998.  The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $217.9 million, before intercompany eliminations, compared with $236.4 million in fiscal 1997, representing a decrease of $18.5 million (8%). Ferrous revenues decreased $17.0 million (9%) as the result of a 5% decrease in ferrous tons shipped at lower average selling prices. Sales to the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business were down slightly. The Metals Recycling Business made 25 ferrous recycled metals export shipments totaling 720,000 tons in fiscal 1998, compared with 30 shipments totaling 853,000 tons in fiscal 1997, while domestic third-party tonnage increased 37% to 235,000 tons. The average selling price for ferrous recycled metals declined $5 per ton to $122 with the largest decline occurring in export prices during the second half of 1998.  The Steel Manufacturing Business' revenues increased $7.7 million (4%) to $191.4 million. Higher volumes sold, coupled with an increase in selling prices, contributed to the increase. Average steel selling prices increased $5 per ton to $339, while finished steel tons shipped increased 6,600 tons to 553,000 tons. During fiscal 1998, the Steel Manufacturing Business also sold 16,900 tons of billets, compared with 5,600 tons during 1997.                                         24                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   Cost of Goods Sold. Overall, cost of goods sold decreased $3.6 million (1%) to $309.6 million and increased as a percentage of revenue from 87% in fiscal 1997 to 88% in fiscal 1998. Gross profit decreased $5.0 million (10%) to $43.5 million.  The Metals Recycling Business' cost of goods sold decreased $8.9 million (5%) to $187.6 million as the result of a 5% decrease in ferrous tonnage shipped. Cost of sales per ferrous ton shipped remained unchanged from 1997 to 1998. The average selling price of ferrous recycled metals also declined, resulting in a decrease in the Metals Recycling Business' gross profit of $9.5 million.  Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business increased $2.7 million (2%) to $178.0 million as the result of increased tonnage shipped. Cost of sales per ton decreased $4 as the result of lower recycled metals prices and increased plant efficiencies. This decrease, coupled with a $5 per ton increase in the average selling price for finished steel and a 1% increase in tonnage shipped, resulted in a $4.8 million (56%) increase in overall gross profit and a 53% increase in gross profit per ton for finished steel.  Selling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million (6%) in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997 primarily as the result of overhead added due to the Proler acquisition in November 1996.  Income from Joint Ventures. The Company's joint ventures' revenues and results of operations were as follows:                                                                          Year Ended August 31,                                                                    ---------------------------                                                                        1998               1997                                                                    --------           --------      Total revenues from external customers recognized by:        Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business             $332,580           $276,930        Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                             51,391             46,433                                                                    --------           --------                                                                    $383,971           $323,363                                                                    ========           ========  Income from joint ventures recognized by the Company:        Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business             $    823           $  3,785        Joint Venture Suppliers of Metals                              3,292              3,091                                                                    --------           --------                                                                    $  4,115           $  6,876                                                                    ========           ========    The increase in revenues generated by the Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business from fiscal 1997 to fiscal 1998 was due to the fact that the Company acquired an interest in the majority of these joint ventures through its acquisition of Proler effective November 29, 1996. Thus, the results for fiscal 1997 include the operations of these joint ventures since that date. During fiscal 1998, these joint ventures shipped 2.3 million tons of ferrous recycled metals from its facilities compared with 2.0 million tons from November 1996 through the end of fiscal 1997. On an annualized basis, tons declined year to year primarily as a result of the Asian financial crisis. The average selling price of ferrous recycled metals processed and sold from the joint ventures' facilities declined from $121 per ton to $117 per ton also due to the financial crisis in Asia.  The decrease in the Company's share of income from the Joint Ventures in the Metals Recycling Business from fiscal 1997 to fiscal 1998 resulted from operating losses due to the Asian financial crisis. Also, the Company's share of a $.4 million charge to income for the closure of redundant plant facilities and a $3.1 million charge to state inventory at the lower of cost or market were included in the results for fiscal 1998. These were partially offset by $2.2 million of other favorable inventory adjustments primarily related to LIFO.                                         25                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   Revenues from the Joint Venture Suppliers of Metal increased by 10%, contributing to an increase in the Company's equity in earnings from these joint ventures of $.2 million. For some of these joint ventures, revenues vary year to year depending upon the projects in which the joint ventures are engaged.  Interest Expense. Interest expense for fiscal 1998 increased by $1.8 million because of additional debt required to support joint venture operations and capital expenditures and lower cash flow from operations. Average borrowings for fiscal 1998 were $97.6 million compared with $96.1 million for 1997. The average interest rate for fiscal 1998 was 5.8% compared with 5.7% for fiscal 1997.  Gain (Loss) on Sale of Fixed Assets. Results for fiscal 1998 include a $2.2 million charge to reflect the estimated loss which the Company expected to realize upon the sale of its Tacoma shredders, which has since been replaced with a state-of-the-art automobile shredder.  Other Income. Other income decreased $3.6 million during the year ended August 31, 1998 compared with the prior year. Fiscal 1997 included a $3 million gain on settlement of an interest rate agreement which it had entered into for the sole purpose of locking in the interest rate on a planned private placement of debt, which the Company subsequently decided against pursuing.  Income Tax Provision. The effective tax rate for fiscal 1998 increased to 38% from 34% in fiscal 1997 as a result of lower benefits from the Company's foreign sales corporation and a reduced benefit from state tax credits.    Year 2000. The following discussion is provided in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Interpretation of Disclosure of Year 2000 Issues and Consequences by Public Companies, Investment Advisors, Investment Companies, and Municipal Securities Issuers.  In response to Year 2000 compliance issues, the Company has developed a systematic approach that consists of the following three phases: (1) identification and assessment of potential Year 2000 issues, (2) modification or replacement of equipment and software, (3) final testing to ensure that all systems are Year 2000 compliant after modifications are installed.  The Company has divided its Year 2000 issues into the following categories: (a) physical hardware and related operating systems at the Corporate Data Processing Facility, (b) business and financial reporting systems at all locations, (c) personal computers and peripheral equipment at all locations, (d) facility and support systems (including communication devices and safety systems) at all locations, (e) manufacturing systems at its Steel Manufacturing Business, (f) business systems for Pick-N-Pull, the Company's self-service auto dismantling joint venture.  The Company has completed the identification and assessment phase.  The Company has completed the modification of equipment at the Corporate Data Processing Facility, the business and financial reporting systems at all locations, personal computers at all locations, and the remainder of Phase 2 activities, except for Pick-N-Pull, which are expected to be complete by December 31, 1999.  The Company completed Phase 3 activities in October 1999, except for Pick-N-Pull, which are expected to be complete by December 31, 1999.  Management estimates that the costs for correction of the Year 2000 issues, including any software and hardware upgrades (but excluding replacements that would have occurred even without the Year 2000 issue), and the cost of personnel allocated to this project should not exceed $1,300,000, of which $1,000,000 is expected to be capital                                         26                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   expenditures. Approximately $879,500 has been spent to date. The Year 2000 upgrades are being funded through normal operating funds and are expected to account for less than 5% of the Company's Information Technology (IT), maintenance and manufacturing capital budgets. There can be no assurance that the costs and timeframes above will not change as the Company continues its assessments.  The Year 2000 project is a priority project for the Company's IT and Engineering departments. No significant IT or engineering projects are being deferred as a result of the Company's Year 2000 efforts.  The Company has also assessed the Year 2000 readiness of its "key" vendors using questionnaires and letters. No critical vendors have been found to be non-compliant.  As the Company is not dependent on any significant customer, and given the nature of the metals recycling business, no Year 2000 assessment of customers is anticipated.  At the present time, the Company has not expended the resources to develop a contingency plan with respect to year 2000 compliance as the Company believes it will be Year 2000 ready.   Liquidity and Capital Resources  For the year ended August 31, 1999, cash generated by operations was $36.8 million compared to $13.3 million for the same period last year. The increase in cash generated this year is predominantly due to decreases in inventories, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses.  Capital expenditures and payments for purchase of interest in joint ventures totaled $12.1 million, $31.3 million, and $58.5 million million for fiscal years 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. Expenditures for fiscal 1997 included the acquisition of Proler for $42.5 million and remaining payments for the new wire rod block for the steel mill that was completed in February 1997.  As part of its acquisitions of Proler and MMI, the Company assumed environmental liabilities aggregating $24.8 million as of August 31, 1999. The Company expects significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of such environmental liabilities.  In June 1997, the Company completed a renegotiation of its unsecured revolving credit agreement whereby it increased the facility to $200 million and extended the maturity of the facility to June 2002. During fiscal 1998, the maturity of the facility was extended to June 2003. As of August 31, 1999, the Company also had additional lines of credit available of $85 million, $65 million of which was uncommitted. In the aggregate, the Company had borrowings outstanding under these lines of $109.9 million. The Company's debt agreements have certain restrictive covenants. As of August 31, 1999, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.  Pursuant to a stock repurchase program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 1.6 million shares of its stock when the market price of the Company's stock is not reflective of management's opinion of an appropriate valuation of the stock. Management believes that repurchasing shares under these conditions enhances shareholder value. As of August 31, 1999, a total of 708,600 shares had been purchased under this program. During fiscal 1999, the Company repurchased 260,300 shares of its stock for a total of $3.2 million.  The Company believes that the current cash balance, internally generated funds and existing credit facilities will provide adequate financing for capital expenditures, working capital, joint ventures, stock repurchases and debt service requirements for the next year. In the longer term, the company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing.                                         27                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.                                     FORM 10-K                                PART II (CONTINUED)   Forward Looking Statements  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. One can identify these forward looking statements through the use of words such as "expect," "believe," and other words which convey a similar meaning. One can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They are likely to address the Company's business strategy, financial projections and results and other global factors affecting the Company's financial prospects. An example of this is the current financial crisis facing certain Asian countries and Year 2000 compliance matters. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: supply and demand conditions; the Company's ability to mitigate the effects of the Asian situation and foreign fiscal policies on its profitability; railroad service difficulties; competitive factors and pricing pressures from national steel companies; imports of foreign steel; availability of recycled metals supply; fluctuations in recycled metals prices and seasonality of results. One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the Company's forward looking statements. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. Further, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statement.   ITEM 7(a). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates. Because such derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent incremental risk to the Company. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" in Note 1 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.  As discussed in "Note 4 - Long-Term Debt" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the Company was committed to interest rate swaps on a revolving credit facility at August 31, 1999. If market rates would have averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal 1999 or fiscal 1998, the effect on the Company's interest expense and net income, after considering the effects of the interest rate swaps, would not have been material.                                         28                          SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
