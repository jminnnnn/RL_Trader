ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION  The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management's view, important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require management's judgment.  The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based on the audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").  The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.  Management bases its estimates on experience and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  A ctual results may differ from those estimates.  The Companys critical accounting policies include:   Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin 104, Revenue Recognition, which requires that: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii) the sales price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue when the building supplies have been shipped.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.  The estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about future operating performance, and may differ from actual cash flows.  Long-lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities.  If the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value of the assets, the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made.      16    Stock-based Compensation  The Company accounts for all stock-based payments and awards under the fair value based method.   Stock-based payments to non-employees are measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, or liabilities incurred, whichever is more reliably measurable.  The fair value of stock-based payments to non-employees is periodically re-measured until the counterparty performance is complete, and any change therein is recognized over the vesting period of the award and in the same manner as if the Company had paid cash instead of paying with or using equity based instruments.  The cost of the stock-based payments to non-employees that is fully vested and non-forfeitable as at the grant date is measured and recognized at that date.   The Company accounts for the granting of share purchase options to employees using the fair value method whereby all awards to employees will be recorded at fair value on the date of the grant.  The fair value of all share purchase options are expensed over their vesting period with a corresponding increase to additional capital surplus.  Upon exercise of share purchase options, the consideration paid by the option holder, together with the amount previously recognized in additional paid-in capital is recorded as an increase to share capital.   The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share purchase options.  Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility.  Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.   Derivative Liabilities  The Companys free standing warrants issued in a conjunction with a private placement and share purchase options granted during the year were classified as liabilities. These liabilities are required to be measured at fair value. These instruments are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end. Any increase or decrease in the fair value are recorded in results of operations as change in fair value of derivative liabilities except for changes in the fair value of employee stock options classified as liabilities being recorded in wages and management fees.  In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company used the Black Scholes pricing model.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   Recently adopted accounting pronouncements  In March 2008, the FASB issued guidance included in ASC 815-10  Derivatives and Hedging,  which seeks to enhance disclosure about how and why a company uses derivatives; how derivative instruments are accounted for and how derivatives affect a companys financial position, financial performance and cash flows.  This guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of ASC 815-10 on July 1, 2009 had no material impact on the Companys financial statements.   In June 2008, the FASB ratified guidance that is now part of ASC 815-40,  Contracts Indexed to the Entitys Own Equity . The objective of this issue is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an entitys own stock. This Issue applies to any freestanding financial instrument or embedded feature that has all the characteristics of a derivative instrument or an instrument which may be potentially settled in an entitys own stock regardless of whether the instrument possess derivative characteristics. This issue provides a two-step approach to assist in making these determinations and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of ASC 815-40 on July 1, 2009 had no material impact on the Companys financial statements.   In April 2009, the FASB issued additional disclosure requirements related to fair values, which are included in ASC 820,  Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.   The provisions require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim-reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements.  The required disclosures were effective for     17    interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009.  The adoption of the provisions did not have a material impact on the Companys statements of financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC No. 855,  Subsequent Events,  which established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. It sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date and up to the date the financial statements are issued.  ASC 855 was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 and did not have any impact on the Companys financ ial statements.   In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  All other accounting literature not included in the ASC is now non-authoritative.  The ASC was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009 and its adoption did not have any impact on the Companys financial statements.   In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-05,  Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value,  or ASU 2009-05, which amends ASC 820 to provide clarification of a circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available.  A reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following methods: 1) a valuation technique that uses a) the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or b) quoted prices for similar liabilities (or similar liabilities when traded as assets) and/or 2) a valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of ASC 820. ASU 2009-05 also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to adjust to include inputs relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability.  The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Companys financial statem ents.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which requires additional disclosures about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements.  This standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and non-recurring Level 2 and Level 3 measurements.  Since this new accounting standard only required additional disclosure, the adoption of the standard in the first quarter of 2010 did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.  Additionally, effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010, this standard will require additional disclosure and require an entity to p resent disaggregated information about activity in Level 3 fair value measurements on a gross basis, rather than one net amount.   In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-13, Compensation  Stock Compensation, or ASU 2010-13, which amends ASC Topic 718 to address the classification of an employee share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in a currency of a market in which the underlying security trades. Specifically, an employee share-based payment award denominated in a currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entitys equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance or service condition and therefore would not classify the award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity.  This update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The Company is     18    currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2010-13 will have on its financial statements.   MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   Equity Financing Timeline  Fiscal 2009:          None  Fiscal 2010-to-date:  15,000,000 units at $0.10 per unit = $1,482,974 ($1,500,000 CDN)  Fiscal 2011-to-date:  None   Fiscal 2010 Ended 6/30/2010  International Barrier Technology Inc. (Barrier) manufactures and sells fire-rated building materials. Barriers primary business is in the United States but through distribution partnerships is endeavoring to enter building products markets in Australia, Europe, and South America. Barrier has a patented fire resistive material (Pyrotite™) and manufacturing process that is applied to building materials to greatly improve their respective fire resistant properties.  Many of the top multifamily and wood frame commercial builders in the United States utilize Barriers fire-rated structural panels in areas where the building code requires the use of a fire-rated building panel.   Barrier manufactures a private label fire rated sheathing product under contract for both LP ®  Building Products, Inc. (LP) and MuleHide Products, Inc. (MuleHide).  LP has introduced a fire rated OSB trademarked LP ®  Flameblock ®  Fire-Rated OSB Sheathing (LP ®  FlameBlock ® ) and MuleHide has been selling MuleHide FR Deck Panel™ (FR Deck Panel) to commercial modular building manufacturers since 2004.   Discussion of Operations  Barrier’s financial statements are filed with both the SEC (USA) and SEDAR (Canada) and are disclosed in US dollars utilizing US generally accepted accounting principles.  Barriers filings with the SEC consist of quarterly reviewed financial statements on Form 10-Q and annual audited financial statements on Form 10-K.  Barrier continues to file the above financial statements with SEDAR in Canada.   Sales   revenue reported for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010 was $2,606,254.  Total sales volume, as measured by surface volume of product shipped, was 5,002,600 sq.ft.  During the same period in the previous year, Barrier shipped 5,780,032 sq.ft. with sales revenue of $4,091,647.   Shipments into the Commercial Modular Market during the fiscal year were 3,034,100 sq. ft.  (vs. 4,182,900 sq. ft. in 2009) Sales into the Residential Roof Deck Market Sector this year were 1,936,400 sq. ft. (a 25% increase over the 1,552,300 sq. ft. in previous year) which was split between the Mid-Atlantic region at 904,100 sq. ft., the South at 421,500 sq. ft., the West at 297,600 sq. ft., the Midwest at 166,000 sq. ft., and a special project in Alaska at 147,200 sq. ft.  There were 32,100 sq. ft. of shipments in the Structural Insulated Panel market during this period.   On January 19, 2010 Barrier entered into an exclusive Supply Agreement with LP, the largest producer of Oriented Strand Board (OSB) in the world.  The agreement gives LP the exclusive right to sell Pyrotite treated panel products in North America under their brand name LP ®  FlameBlock ®  Fire-Rated OSB Sheathing.  While this agreement is expected to dramatically improve sales volume and financial performance for Barrier, sales revenue reported will be influenced in a negative direction since LP will be providing their own OSB, with no pass through charges for Barrier on the substrate or inbound and outbound freight. Barriers margin will be on the treatment of the OSB only.   Gross profit  for Fiscal 2010 was $75,622 vs. $577,154 in the previous year.  The gross margin, as a percentage of sales revenue, was 3% in comparison to 14% in the prior year.  Gross margins are affected dramatically by sales volume because as the fixed cost portion of Barriers business is factored over a larger sales volume the cost per sq.ft. of sales goes down dramatically.  The larger the volume shipped, the smaller the cost per sq.ft. of fixed costs and the costs of sales and administrative services. We anticipate larger gross margins as sales volumes rise.    19    Cost of sales   decreased to $2,530,632 in fiscal 2010 from $3,514,493 in Fiscal 2009.  The decrease is attributable to the continuation of improvements in efficiency of operations and the fact that less volume is being produced. The gain in efficiency is reflected in the decreased year-to-date average cost per sq.ft. of production of $0.51 in comparison to $0.61 in the comparable period.   Substrate cost and materials/labor were the major expenses in this category.  Substrate accounted for $744,065 for the fiscal year versus $1,354,082 in the same period last year. Materials and labor accounted for an additional $953,068 in the twelve month period in 2010 versus $1,084,898 in 2009.   R&D expenses and activity has generally been limited to those areas allowing LP to introduce LP ®  FlameBlock ®  into targeted markets such as the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) zoned properties in California and for fire rated wall assemblies in wood framed commercial buildings. Barriers International Code Council Evaluations Services Report (ICC-ES 1365) has been updated and it now includes LP Building Products, Inc. as an additional listee. This allows LP to sell their LP ®  FlameBlock ®  product in any application originally certified for Blazeguard®, Barriers original fire rated sheathing product.   Depreciation on plant and equipment is included in cost of sales category. Depreciation, which has non-cash impact on Barriers actual cash flow, decreased slightly from $264,122 in 2009 to $264,101.  The expense reflects scheduled depreciation of the new manufacturing line equipment and building expansion.  Amortization, another non-cash category of reporting, of the worldwide Pyrotite technology (including patents, technical know-how, and trademarks) began when Barrier purchased it in 2004 and will continue at existing rates until it is fully depreciated (eight years).   Barrier and Pyrotite Corporation successfully negotiated the termination of an agreement that had assigned the technology rights of integrally treated (non-coated boards) OSB to Pyrotite Corporation Late in March 2010. To date, no additional amortization amounts or schedule has been added to Barriers financial statement in this reporting period, both because it happened so late in the quarter and the added value of the additional technology has not been fully assessed. Further discussion of this transaction will occur in subsequent financial reports from Barrier.   Administrative expenses  for the Fiscal 2010 increased to $1,393,570 from $1,159,294 in the prior year.  During this period, stock options were issued to key management employees as well as the Board of Directors as a part of Barriers shareholder approved stock-based incentive program. Most of the options issued prior to this period had expired and a major part of this issuance was to replace and provide this incentive where deemed appropriate.  During the twelve months ended June 30, 2010, a compensation charge included in administrative expenses was $500,900 versus $9,820 in the same period in 2009.   Administrative costs (including stock-based compensation of $500,900 (2009: $9,820)) per square foot, was $0.28 in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010. In the same period in the previous year administrative costs per square foot were $0.20. Over this time, volume dropped from 5,780,032 sq.ft. to 5,002,600 sq. ft.  Barrier continued to focus on holding expenses at a minimum during this transition period.  Increasing volumes will generally cause a reduction in the average cost of administrative expense per sq. ft. Barrier expects the future reduction in the average cost of administration to have a significant impact on bottom line performance in future reporting periods as sales volumes rise with an improving economy.   Accounting and Audit Fees  increased from $74,537 to $84,173.   This is attributed to complies accounting matters related to financial instruments issued by the Company during the year.   Insurance costs  have increased to $71,936 in comparison to $62,399 the previous year.  The difference is due to annually adjusted premiums.     20    Legal fees  increased to $80,422 for the annual period ending June 30, 2010.  For the same period in the prior year, legal fees were $73,631.  Legal fees were expended on a the development of a Supply Agreement with LP for Barrier to provide fire treatment services for LPs oriented strand board (OSB) panel products as well as for help in the drafting and review of certain business correspondence.  In March 2010, Barrier was awarded sole ownership to the worldwide rights from Pyrotite Corporation (holder of the integral treatment Pyrotite patent) through a mediation hearing.  The rights, in addition to a lump sum payment, were agreed upon to settle amounts due to Barrier per the royalty payments due for receipts Pyrotite Corporation received over the past few years related to integral Pyrotite technology.   Barrier believes protecting its technology and trademarks is an important step in positioning itself to develop strategic partners and potential technology licensees.  Barrier received the final patent approval on the manufacturing process in late October 2009.   Sales, marketing, and investor relations  increased for the twelve month period ($79,569 vs. $66,876). Barrier is intent upon developing markets where exterior wall designs are required to accommodate both strength and fire considerations; this is inherently the case in the wild-fire prone areas of the west coast where building for earthquake risks is code mandated.   Sales expenses, therefore, are expected to grow during Fiscal 2010 with the development of both the northern and southern California territories, Oregon, and Colorado  the Northern Pacific region.  While Barrier has always planned business travel to accommodate only necessary trips, all business travel is will continue to be pre-approved by a cash flow committee in addition to approval by Barriers CEO.    Loss before Other Items.    Loss before other items of ($1,317,948) is being reported for the fiscal period ending June 30, 2010, whereas in the same period in 2009, a net loss of ($582,140) was reported.     The net reported loss for Fiscal 2010 was heavily impacted by the non-cash charge for stock options.  The net loss, however, was also impacted by the lower volume of sales and shipments experienced in this twelve month period as compared both to 2009 and 2008.    Barrier needs to maintain a higher level of sales to support a viable business in the building products industry. Barrier believes that the new strategic partnerships with LP coupled with the MuleHide Agreement will support a much larger sales volume as the economy improves. As LP customers become more aware of LPs entry into the fire rated sheathing market, shifts will occur in product mix that will improve Barriers market share in targeted applications. The revenue generated by the private placement of shares, including the warrants which may be exercised at later dates, will serve to fund the business and cover operating losses that may ensue as the transition to higher volumes occurs over the next few months.   Other items   include income and costs not directly related to business operations.  Other income items reported during the period herein include $3,017 in interest income and ($30,615) in foreign exchange loss.  To compare, for the same reporting period last year, interest income was $7,521 and foreign exchange was a negative ($58,088) year-to-date.   Barrier and the Seattle based Pyrotite Corporation successfully negotiated the termination of a technology agreement that had assigned the rights to integrally treated (non-coated) OSB to Pyrotite Corporation. With the assignment of the integrally treated OSB (IPOSB) technology to Pyrotite Corporation an obligation to pay a royalty to Barrier ensued; Pyrotite has been providing quarterly statements for these royalty fees and paying them to Barrier on occasion. The termination of this agreement resulted in a final royalty payment to Barrier of $90,000 that was accounted for as other income during the period.   Interest on Long Term Debt has decreased from $85,838 to $79,921 for the year-to-date reporting period as overall long-term debt continues to decrease.     The regulatory agencies that oversee the reporting functions of publicly traded companies regulate how companies report the costs and revenue associated with the     21    sale of equity (stock) in the company. In March, 2010, Barrier issued, and sold in a private placement, 15 million shares of stock at the price of $0.10 CDN per share. In addition, the purchasers of the shares were awarded the right to buy an additional share (warrant) at $0.15 CDN. As a result of this transaction Barrier is required to report a cost of $935,700 representing a change in the fair value of derivative liabilities in this reporting period (See Note 5).   Summary of Quarterly Results.   The following is a summary of the Companys financial results for the nine most recently completed quarters:      June 30   2010  Mar 31   2010  Dec 31   2009  Sept 30   2009  Jun 30   2009  Mar 31   2009  Dec 31   2008  Sept 30   2008  June 30  2008   Volume shipped (MSF)  1,496  1,261  1,343  903  1,011  1,085  1,578  2,106  1,891   Total Revenues (000)  $574  $660  $791  $581  $618  $764  $1,123  $1,587  $1,349   Operating Income   (000)  ($370)  ($652)  ($101)  ($195)  ($277)  ($211)  ($94)  ($0)  ($143)   Net income (loss)   (000)  ($117)  ($1,883)  ($124)  ($206)  ($346)  ($215)  ($164)  $6  ($134)   EPS (Loss) Per Share  ($0.00)  ($0.06)  ($0.00)  ($0.01)  ($0.00)  ($0.01)  ($0.01)  $0.00  ($0.01)     Selected Annual Information   The following financial data is for the three most recent years ended June 30:      2010  2009  2008   Total Revenue  $2,606.3  $4,092.0  $4,878.0   Net income (loss)  (2,330.0)  (719.0)  (808.0)   Per share  (0.07)  (0.02)  (0.03)   Per share, fully diluted  (0.07)  (0.02)  (0.03)   Total assets  5,002.0  4,849.0  5,738.0   Total long-term financial liabilities  774.0  1,205.0  1,145.0   Cash dividends declared per share  Nil  Nil  Nil     New product and market development  New product and market development activities have been curtailed over the past year as a result of reduced sales volume. Barrier anticipates that as the economy improves and strategic partnerships develop, an increase in this activity will transpire.   New product and market development activity during this period has generally been limited to those areas which will allow LP to introduce LP ®  FlameBlock ®  into targeted markets such as the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) zoned properties in California and for fire rated wall assemblies in wood framed commercial buildings. Barriers International Code Council Evaluations Services Report (ICC-ES 1365) has been updated and it now includes LP Building Products, Inc. as an additional listee. This allows LP to sell their LP ®  FlameBlock ®  product in any application originally certified for Blazeguard ® , Barriers original fire rated sheathing product.   Global licensing opportunities  Barrier   has begun exploring opportunities for both Pyrotite technology licensing and distribution of US manufactured products as a part of the LP Building Products agreement. LP is active internationally and has offered to potentially extend their influence in Europe, Australia, and South America if the opportunity seems mutually beneficial. In addition, Barrier continues to explore the opportunity for developing fire resistive panels for the emerging Structural Insulated Panel (SIP) market in Australia with an American company currently doing SIP business there. More information will be presented on these opportunities in subsequent reports as it develops.   Financial position & financings  Barrier ended the period with a working capital deficiency of ($1,742,966), of which ($2,519,600) is a required non-cash fair market value derivative liability related to the outstanding warrants and options issued during the period.     22    The Company generated negative operating cash flow for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 of ($366,392) in comparison to ($318,979) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2009.  The net cash outflow from operating activities for the current fiscal period ended was primarily a result of a net loss of ($2,329,567), the non-cash items (stock-based compensation of $500,900 and amortization of $126,816), and an increase in inventory of $58,172.  The Company expects to fund short-term cash needs out of current operations and supplement other short-term needs with the funds raised in the recent private placement that was successfully completed to pay down debt and generate extra working capital.   Investing activities used $23,068 during the year compared with a use of $14,196 during the year ended June 30, 2009. The amount of capital expenditures incurred by the Company has decreased from past years. The Company does not expect any significant additional long-term capital investments in the near future as they recently expanded manufacturing operations with a more efficient automated process that is projected to fulfill mid-term growth needs.  Should a developing strategic alliance create the need for a quick ramp up of production and sales, however, some additional investments in working capital (e.g.; raw materials and finished goods inventory) will be required. In addition, the company has identified some relatively small capital improvement projects specifically targeted on material storage and moving larger amounts of items though the shop on a timely basis. These funds are available, generated by the private placement of stock id entified above.   Financing activities resulted in net cash inflow of $1,041,858 in the current period compared to a net cash inflow of $107,472 for the same period last year. Cash generated by financing activities is attributable to a private placement of 15,000,000 equity units undertaken during the year for which the Company raised $1,461,626 ($1,500,000 CDN)    There is no assurance that we will operate profitably or will generate positive cash flow in the future. In addition, our operating results in the future may be subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors not within our control, such as the unpredictability of when customers will order products, the size of customers' orders, the demand for our products, the level of competition or general economic conditions.   Although management believes that revenues will increase, management also expects an increase in operating costs. Consequently, the Company expects to incur operating losses and negative cash flow until our products gain market acceptance sufficient to generate a commercially viable and sustainable level of sales, and/or additional products are developed and commercially released and sales of such products made so that we are operating in a profitable manner.   Current and Future Financing Needs   Having undertaken an equity financing during the year ended June 30, 2010, management of the Company believes it has sufficient cash to operate its business for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.  At June 30, 2010, the current cash and cash equivalents total $863,121 and there is currently no available funds to draw on the revolving credit facility. Over the next 12 months, the Company anticipates that the operation of business will produce an average negative monthly operating cash flow of approximately $15,000 for a total of $180,000 for the 2010 fiscal year.  In addition, over the next 12 months, the Company is required to make payments totaling $144,800 in respect of its long-term debt and capital lease obligations and $370,000 in respect of accounts payable outstanding as at June 30, 2010 leaving a cash balance of $168,000 at the end of the fiscal year.     The Company bases its estimate of future cash requirements on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and the requirements for cash are subject to factors, some of which are not within the control of the Company, including:   ·  Increased costs of general and administrative expenses  ·  Increased costs of raw materials and freight  ·  Costs associated with the research and development activities  ·  Costs associated with maintaining property, plant and equipment and intellectual property    23     Related Party Transactions   During the fiscal period ended June 30, 2010 the Company incurred wages and management fees of $594,064 (of which $181,064 was wages and management fees and $413,000 was share-based compensation) with directors of the Company or private companies with common directors.  The Company paid $173,717 in wages and management fees for the same prior year-to-date.

Fair Value Measurements   The Company measures the fair value of its assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy under GAAP is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:     24    Level 1- quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;   Level 2 -  observable inputs other than Level I, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and    Level 3 - assets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   During the year ended June 30, 2010, the Company determined that the warrants included in its offering of equity units during the year required bifurcation as derivative liabilities.  The resulting derivative is required to be measured at its their fair value each reporting period.

During the reporting period, The Company paid $225,000 on the revolving bank loan facility.  In addition, a payment of $80,000 was made to reduce the term debt.   On January 19, 2010, Barrier and LP ®  Building Products (LP) executed a 1-year Supply Agreement where Barrier has agreed to provide exclusive fire treatment services for LP on their oriented strand board panel product (OSB). LP is the largest producer of OSB in the world. LP will market and sell the fire treated OSB in North America under their own trade name LP ®  FlameBlock ®  Fire-Rated OSB Sheathing. Barrier has agreed not to market or sell Pyrotite™ technology coated wood products under the registered trademark Blazeguard ®  for as long as the agreement is in place. Current Blazeguard customers, as of January 19, will be referred to LP customer service when they wish to place orders or arrange for shipping schedules. Barrier will provide technical support. Barrier will continue to supply MuleHide FR Deck Panel to MuleHide Products, Inc. under the existing Supply Agreement executed  between Barrier and MuleHide in 2004.   LP studied available fire retardant technology for OSB for some time and after an exhaustive review of available technologies, selected Pyrotite™, Barrier’s proprietary and patent protected technology. The Barrier/LP partnership is particularly powerful in that it links the raw manufacturing of the OSB substrate with the company that actually mixes and produces the fire retardant slurry. Barrier and LP believe that not only will LP ®  FlameBlock ®  be recognized as the premier fire rated sheathing in the marketplace; it will be priced competitively to alternative products. LP has a strong sales and distribution network all over North America and will be able to leverage this substantial support network in a way that Barrier was never able to do successfully with its relatively small size.   More descriptive details relating to the long-term relationship of LP and Barrier will be reported as they are developed. Presently, however, Barrier and LP agree that moving quickly to establish both a customer base of support and recognition of the product in the builder community is the number one priority. Establishing market share now, while the overall building market is slow, will enable LP ®  FlameBlock ®  sales to grow exponentially as the economy improves.    LPs number one market development priority will be roof and exterior wall applications in the wildfire prone areas of California. LP ®  FlameBlock ® s inherent attributes of strength enhancement coupled with superior fire protection will help position it as the premier choice for residential and commercial wood framed construction because along the west coast designing for both fire and earthquake protection is required.
