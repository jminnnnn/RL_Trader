ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                 The following should be read in connection with all consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this report.    General             Our business consists of a wide variety of health and beauty care products, convenience oriented food and general merchandise items and a pharmacy operation managed to supply customers with their prescription needs. We refer to the non-prescription portion of our business as front-end sales because most of these sales are processed through the front main check-out sections of our stores. This portion of our business consists of over-the-counter medications, health and beauty care items, food and beverages, tobacco products, cosmetics, housewares, greeting cards, photofinishing, photo supplies, seasonal and general merchandise. Health and beauty care products including over-the-counter items represent our highest volume categories within front-end sales. The front-end portion of our business represented 56.4% of our sales in the year ended December 27, 2003 and is characterized by generally higher gross margins that are approximately twice that of our pharmacy or back-end business. Our front-end business is generally a larger proportion of our total sales than other major drug store chains, which average 35% to 45%, but similar to most other drug store chains, represents a decreasing share of business year after year due to the faster rate of pharmacy sales growth. Our high percentage of front-end sales is driven by our convenient locations in high traffic residential and commercial areas. Our pharmacy sales include all items we sell by prescription filled within our retail locations or in our central fill facility and delivered to our stores or direct to customers. The pharmacy portion of our business is dominated by and dependent upon a number of third party private and government-sponsored plans that contract with us as an authorized provider of prescriptions.            Third party prescription plans represented 91.4% of our pharmacy sales in fiscal 2003. The pharmacy portion of our business is subject to a number of federal, state and local regulations that govern the conduct of this business. Pharmacy sales have been among the fastest growing retail categories over the last several years due to a number of favorable demographic and industry trends such as the aging of the population, expanding penetration of third party private and government-sponsored coverage and the increasing usage of prescription drugs to improve quality of life and in place of medical procedures. Along with the fast pace of growth in this area have come generally higher rates of product cost inflation, resulting in an increased focus on the part of both government and private plans to control their costs of providing these benefits. As a result, pharmacy gross margins have been under pressure.            While remaining one of the fastest growing retail categories in 2003, the industry as a whole experienced substantially reduced rates of pharmacy same-store sales growth resulting from a decline in the demand for hormonal replacement drugs, conversion of some high volume prescription drugs to over-the-counter status, increased levels of required co-payments by insurers, increased utilization of lower priced generic medications and reductions in coverage resulting from high unemployment rates.            We operate 85% of our 241 stores in New York City and therefore our financial performance is heavily influenced by the local economy. We analyze a number of economic indicators specific to New York City to gauge the health of this economy including unemployment rates, job creation, gross city product and bridge and tunnel commuter traffic patterns. We also analyze market share data, same-store sales trends, average store sales and sales per square foot data among other key performance indicators to monitor our overall performance.            The New York City economy experienced continued high unemployment rates and additional declines in employment during 2003, as businesses continued to downsize and the effects of higher personal, sales and real estate taxes impacted consumers and businesses alike. The New York City    24          unemployment rate was 7.2% during December 2003, as compared to a national unemployment rate of 5.7%, and New York City employment declined by 55,000 jobs based on a comparison of December 2003 to December 2002 employment data compiled by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, fiscal 2003 did see an improvement in the national economy and a recovery of the financial markets, and the New York City gross domestic product experienced positive growth in the third quarter of 2003 after 10 successive down quarters, which may potentially lead to improved economic conditions in New York City in the upcoming year.    Results of Operations             In fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, we experienced declining same-store sales growth and a reduction in our earnings due to the following:       Lost sales and profits resulting from the destruction of two stores in the World Trade Center attacks and the subsequent relocation of certain employers and customers from downtown Manhattan;  Declines in the financial markets and the general recessionary economy in the New York metropolitan area over the last two years; and  Various legislative changes that were adverse to our business (such as increased taxes and reduced Medicaid prescription reimbursement rates).             The September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center complex in downtown Manhattan resulted in the total destruction of that landmark and significant disruption of commerce throughout the entire city, within which most of our stores are located. The attack resulted in the complete loss of two stores, one of which was our top performing store based on sales volume and profit contribution. As a result, during fiscal 2002, we received insurance reimbursements for all of our remaining property losses associated with the September 11 disaster and approximately $9.4 million toward our business interruption claim that was recognized as a separate component of income in our attached consolidated financial statements. This business interruption recovery represented a partial payment of our losses, and we are currently in litigation with the insurance carrier to recover the balance of our business interruption claim.            In fiscal 2003, we achieved sales of $1.384 billion, an increase of 8.6% over fiscal 2002 sales of $1.274 billion. Same-store sales (defined as sales from stores that have been open at least 13 months) increased 2.7% resulting from a same-store sales increase of 7.5% in pharmacy partially offset by a decline of 0.8% in front-end same-store sales.            Net income for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2003 was $5.1 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $24.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 results include pre-tax charges of $0.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for debt extinguishment costs and $0.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for transaction costs associated with our anticipated acquisition by Duane Reade Acquisition. Fiscal 2003 results also include a pre-tax charge of $12.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, related to recognition of a National Labor Relations Board Administrative Law Judge recommendation in a litigation matter concerning our collective bargaining agreement with the Allied Trades Council, a union representing employees in 139 of our stores. Fiscal 2002 results included debt extinguishment costs of $11.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, partially offset by the receipt of an initial payment of our World Trade Center business interruption insurance claim of $9.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share. Net income for fiscal 2002, including the cumulative effect of the accounting change, was $15.6 million, or $0.63 per diluted share. The most significant factors contributing to the decline in profitability in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 were:       The pre-tax charge of $12.6 million discussed above;    25             Declines in pharmacy gross margins attributable to reductions in New York Medicaid reimbursement rates enacted during 2003 and continued pressure by other third party plans to reduce prescription costs;  A lower rate of pharmacy same-store sales growth generally experienced throughout the industry during 2003. Our pharmacy same-store sales growth declined from 12.1% in fiscal 2002 to 7.5% in fiscal 2003, resulting in part from higher unemployment rates that reduced the number of customers with prescription coverage insurance plans, increased third party plan co-payments, declines in demand for hormone replacement medications and conversion of certain high volume medications from pharmacy to over-the-counter status;  The relative immaturity of recently opened stores, which are generally not expected to be profitable until some time after opening;  Decreases in front-end same-store sales resulting from the depressed New York City economy as well as an August 2003 power blackout that disrupted business, resulting in a loss of approximately $1.3 million of pre-tax income. These sales declines reduced our gross margins because front-end products have gross margins that are generally double the margins of prescriptions;  Increases in store occupancy costs resulting from new stores, which generally pay higher rent than older stores, lower real estate-related income from lease terminations and store relocations and an 18% increase in New York City real estate taxes that became effective on January 1, 2003;  Increased professional and legal-related costs of approximately $3.4 million associated with various litigation, including our efforts to recover the full value of the World Trade Center business interruption insurance claim and various real estate and labor matters; and  Increased store-level expenses associated with the significant number of one-hour photo departments opened in 2002 and 2003 that were immature and not yet profitable as well as costs to expand the number of 24-hour stores and increased operating hours in other stores to improve convenience for our customers.             The factors detailed above reduced our ability to continue to absorb a high rate of new store growth while producing increased levels of profitability. New stores are generally not profitable for twelve to eighteen months and do not reach mature levels of sales and profitability until three to five years after opening. The large number of immature stores (approximately 43% of our chain was less than four years old at December 27, 2003) in a period of declining front-end same-store sales and reduced rates of pharmacy same-store sales growth combined to adversely impact our results more significantly than in past periods of more robust same-store sales growth. Our reduced levels of new store growth initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 are expected to result in a lower financial burden of immature stores in the future.    26                  The following sets forth the results of operations in dollars (in thousands) and as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated.             2003     2002     2001             Dollars     % of Sales     Dollars     % of Sales     Dollars     % of Sales       Net sales     $  1,383,828     100.0  %  $  1,274,451     100.0  %  $  1,143,564     100.0  %    Cost of sales        1,087,092     78.6        988,033     77.5        871,215     76.2                                       Gross profit        296,736     21.4        286,418     22.5        272,349     23.8       Selling, general and administrative expenses        227,910     16.5        198,513     15.6        172,972     15.1       Labor contingency expense        12,600     0.9                                 Transaction expenses        644                                      Insurance recovery                     (9,378  )  (0.7  )                 Depreciation and amortization        32,335     2.3        26,935     2.1        26,634     2.3       Store pre-opening expenses        1,063     0.1        2,086     0.2        1,667     0.1                                       Operating income        22,184     1.6        68,262     5.4        71,076     6.2       Net interest expense        14,117     1.0        17,925     1.4        27,623     2.4       Debt extinguishment        812     0.1        11,371     0.9        2,616     0.2                                       Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change        7,255     0.5        38,966     3.1        40,837     3.6       Income tax expense        (2,181  )  (0.2  )     (14,127  )  (1.1  )     (16,107  )  (1.4  )                                    Income before cumulative effect of accounting change        5,074     0.4        24,839     1.9        24,730     2.2       Cumulative effect of accounting change, net                     (9,262  )  (0.7  )                                                 Net income     $  5,074     0.4  %  $  15,577     1.2  %  $  24,730     2.2  %                                       Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002             Net sales in the year ended December 27, 2003 were $1.38 billion, an increase of 8.6% over the year ended December 28, 2002 sales of $1.27 billion. The increase was due to an increase in same-store sales of 2.7% and the inclusion of 28 net new stores opened in 2002 for the entire 2003 period and 13 net new stores opened in 2003. The increase in same-store sales was due to a pharmacy same-store sales increase of 7.5% partially offset by a front-end same-store sales decline of 0.8%. The most significant factors impacting our front-end sales performance during 2003 compared to 2002 were the continued depressed economic conditions and high unemployment that combined to restrain consumer demand. Front-end sales were also negatively affected by the August 2003 power blackout. Pharmacy same-store growth rates also decelerated from the 12.1% achieved in 2002 due to the factors discussed in the introduction above. We believe that despite these factors, long-term pharmacy same-store sales trends will continue to be favorable, driven in part by advantageous demographic trends associated with an aging population that we believe will rely more heavily on prescription medications.            Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 78.6% for 2003 from 77.5% in 2002, resulting in a decrease in gross margin to 21.4% for 2003 from 22.5% in 2002. The gross margin decline primarily resulted from the following factors:       Reduced pharmacy gross margins resulting from reductions in New York State Medicaid prescription reimbursement rates and increased use of generic reimbursement limitations by both private third party and government-sponsored plans;  An increased proportion of lower margin third party and general pharmacy prescription sales along with a decline in higher margin front-end same-store sales; and    27             Increased store occupancy costs attributable to immature stores opened over the last three years which have higher rent costs because rents are closer to current market rates than older, more mature stores), lower real estate-related income from lease terminations and store relocations and higher New York City real estate taxes that increased 18% effective January 1, 2003.             Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from 15.6% in 2002 to 16.5% in 2003. The increase was due to the following factors:       A lower rate of same-store sales growth in 2003 than in 2002, particularly in the pharmacy portion of our business which declined from a growth rate of 12.1% in 2002 to 7.5% in 2003;  Increased professional and legal expenses associated with various litigation matters, including our efforts to recover our business interruption insurance claim related to the September 11 disaster;  Increased labor costs to support greater numbers of 24-hour stores and expanded operating hours, increased pharmacy wages and costs to implement a new shelf labeling system;  Increased expenses to support immature one-hour photo departments opened in 2002 and 2003;  Increases in credit and debit card processing fees; and  Increased costs of insurance due to changes in the market.             Depreciation and amortization expense in 2003 and 2002 was $32.3 million and $26.9 million, respectively. The increase was attributable to capital spending for property and equipment additions during 2002 and 2003, primarily in support of new store growth as well as amortization expenses for pharmacy customer lists and lease acquisition costs for acquisitions completed during 2002 and 2003. In December 2002, we began to reduce our rate of new store growth from an average of 27 stores per year over the period from 1999 through 2002 to 17 stores opened in fiscal 2003. The reduction in new store growth recognizes our need to grow more slowly in the face of recent economic conditions and reduced profit margins.             Store pre-opening expenses of $1.1 million related to the opening of 17 stores in fiscal 2003, compared to pre-opening expenses of $2.1 million reflecting 32 store openings in 2002.            During 2003, we recorded total debt extinguishment charges of $0.8 million, as compared to $11.4 million in 2002. Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding these expenses.            Net interest expense decreased to $14.1 million in 2003 from $17.9 million in 2002. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the retirement of most of the 9.25% Senior Subordinated Notes in June 2002 with the proceeds from our convertible note offering as well as lower interest costs associated with the replacement of our previous Senior Credit Agreement with a new asset-based revolving credit agreement in July 2003.            Our effective tax rate in 2003 was 30.1% as compared to 36.3% in 2002. The lower effective tax rate is attributable to the impact of employment tax credits on significantly reduced pre-tax income, partially offset by incremental tax expense recorded in connection with New York State legislation enacted during the second quarter of 2003 with retroactive application to January 1, 2003, that eliminated deductions for royalty fee expenses paid to out of state affiliated companies.             During 2002, as a result of the change in accounting method for inventory valuation from the retail dollar-based FIFO method to a specific cost-based LIFO method, we recorded a one-time, non-cash after-tax charge of $9.3 million. There were no cumulative effects of accounting changes recorded in 2003.    28          Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001             Net sales in the year ended December 28, 2002 were $1.27 billion, an increase of 11.4% over the year ended December 29, 2001 sales of $1.14 billion. The increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of 4.8% and the inclusion of 31 stores opened during 2001 for the entire 2002 period and 28 net new stores opened in 2002. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to improved pharmacy sales, which increased to 41.8% of total sales in 2002 compared to 39.2% of total sales in 2001. Pharmacy sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth rates versus front-end sales. Pharmacy comparable store sales increased by 12.1%, while front-end comparable store sales were unchanged.            Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 77.5% for 2002 from 76.2% for 2001, resulting in a decrease in gross margin to 22.5% for 2002 from 23.8% for 2001. The gross margin decline primarily resulted from the following factors:       The absence of comparable store growth in higher margin front-end sales and faster growth rate in lower margin pharmacy sales. The absence of growth in same-store front-end sales is largely attributable to the recessionary economy in the metropolitan New York market throughout 2002; and  An increase in store-level front-end inventory shrink-related losses.             Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from 15.1% in 2001 to 15.6% of sales in 2002. The increase was due to the following factors:       A lower rate of same-store sales growth in 2002 than in 2001;  Increased labor costs and expenses of operating leases associated with the establishment of 65 incremental one-hour photo processing departments;  Higher costs of property insurance in the aftermath of the September 11 disaster; and  Increased legal and litigation-related expenses.             Depreciation and amortization of intangibles in 2002 and 2001 was $26.9 million and $26.6 million, respectively. The increase was attributable to capital spending for property and equipment additions during 2001 and 2002, primarily in support of new store growth as well as amortization expenses for pharmacy customer lists and lease acquisition costs for acquisitions completed during 2001 and 2002. Fiscal 2002 also reflects a benefit of approximately $4.3 million due to the elimination of goodwill amortization, attributable to our adoption of FAS 142.            Store pre-opening expenses of $2.1 million related to the opening of 32 stores in 2002 as compared to $1.7 million reflecting 31 store openings in 2001.            During 2002, we recorded total debt extinguishment charges of $11.4 million, as compared to $2.6 million in 2001. Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding these expenses.            Net interest expense decreased to $17.9 million in 2002 from $27.6 million in 2001. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to the $210.5 million of proceeds from the April 2002 Convertible Note Offering that were used to reduce higher cost term loan, revolver and 9.25% Senior Subordinated Note borrowings. In addition, we realized lower interest rates on the floating rate portion of our revolving credit facility during 2002.    29       NAME="page_de3200_1_30">                 Our effective tax rate in 2002 was 36.3% as compared to 39.4% in 2001.             During 2002, as a result of the change in accounting method for inventory valuation from the retail dollar-based FIFO method to a specific cost-based LIFO method, we recorded a one-time, non-cash after-tax charge of $9.3 million, as a cumulative effect of accounting change.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             On April 16, 2002, we completed an offering (the "2002 Offering") of $381.5 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes maturing on April 16, 2022 (the "Convertible Notes"). After deducting commissions and expenses related to the offering, we realized net proceeds of $210.5 million. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay an aggregate of approximately $86.1 million in principal amount of Term A loans and Term B loans and $41.5 million in principal amount of revolving loans under our then existing Senior Credit Agreement. In addition, we terminated an interest rate swap agreement, which was set to expire in January 2003, at a cost of approximately $4.0 million.            The Convertible Notes were issued at a discount and pay cash interest at the rate of 2.1478% per year on the principal amount at maturity, until April 16, 2007. After that date, interest will accrue on the notes as amortization of the original issue discount representing a yield to maturity of 3.75% per year, computed on a semi-annual bond equivalent basis. In December 2002, we repurchased a total of $30.5 million principal value of Convertible Notes at an average price of $486.99 per $1,000 note, resulting in the remaining net outstanding balance of $201.0 million.            Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert each $1,000 in principal amount of their Convertible Notes into 14.1265 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment, only if (1) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (2) the notes are called for redemption, or (3) specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we have the right to deliver, in lieu of our common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock in an amount as described in the indenture governing our Convertible Notes. It is our current intention to redeem these notes by delivering cash.            Holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on April 16, 2007 at a price of $572.76 per note plus accrued cash interest, if any; on April 16, 2012 at a price of $689.68 per note plus accrued cash interest, if any; and on April 16, 2017 at a price of $830.47 per note plus accrued cash interest, if any. We may choose to pay the purchase price of such notes in cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. It is our current intention to redeem these notes by delivering cash. Holders of the notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder's notes at a price equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, to the date of purchase if we experience a change in control. The planned acquisition by Duane Reade Acquisition would result in a change of control. We expect substantially all holders will exercise this change of control right if this transaction is consummated.            Messrs. Cuti, Charboneau and Ray own approximately $1.1 million of the Convertible Notes and have informed us that they intend to exercise their repurchase rights. In connection with the exercise of their repurchase rights, Messrs. Cuti, Charboneau and Ray are expected to receive an aggregate amount of approximately $1.2 million.             We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Convertible Notes at any time after April 16, 2007, at a price equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, to the redemption date.            On June 3, 2002, we completed a tender offer and consent solicitation (the "Tender Offer") to purchase our then outstanding 9.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "Senior Subordinated    30          Notes"). On that date, we expended a total of $87.1 million from the balance of the proceeds of the 2002 Offering to pay our obligations under the Tender Offer. This payment was composed of principal value ($78.4 million), premium payments ($6.5 million) and accrued interest earned from February 16, 2002 through the payment date ($2.2 million). During the fourth quarter of 2002, we repurchased and retired $17.5 million of the Convertible Notes at a cost of $14.9 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain on debt extinguishment of $2.6 million.            On February 18, 2003, we retired the remaining $1.6 million of Senior Subordinated Notes. The total cash outlay required for this retirement, including principal ($1.6 million), early termination premiums ($0.1 million) and accrued interest earned from August 15, 2002 to the payment date ($0.1 million), amounted to approximately $1.8 million.            On July 21, 2003, we completed the refinancing of the Senior Credit Agreement which was set to expire on February 15, 2004. The new credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") is an asset-based revolving loan under which all of our cash receipts are swept daily into a concentration account under the control of the administrative agent for the lenders and applied to reduce any outstanding revolver borrowings. This credit facility uses a pre-determined percentage of the current value of our inventory and selected accounts receivable to calculate the availability of funds eligible to be borrowed up to an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets. In addition, the Credit Agreement has been guaranteed by each of our corporate subsidiaries, and such guarantees are secured by substantially all assets of such guarantors. The guarantees of the subsidiary guarantors are full and unconditional, joint and several. The Credit Agreement matures on July 20, 2008 and carries improved terms, including a lower interest rate than the previously existing Senior Credit Agreement.            Under the new facility, approximately $103.5 million was borrowed and used to repay in full the outstanding balances of Term A, Term B and revolver borrowings under the refinanced Senior Credit Agreement, as well as accumulated interest to the repayment date and certain expenses associated with the new financing. At December 27, 2003, there was $70.4 million outstanding under the new revolving credit facility, and approximately $122.9 million of remaining availability, net of $2.1 million reserved for standby letters of credit. Our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement are principally LIBOR-based borrowings. The margin on these borrowings is fixed at 1.75% for the first year, and is subject to a sliding scale adjustment thereafter, based on remaining levels of availability.            The Credit Agreement contains a single fixed charge coverage requirement that only becomes applicable when borrowings exceed 90 percent of the borrowing base, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the new Credit Agreement have not exceeded 90 percent of the borrowing base and, as a result, the fixed charge covenant did not become applicable during the period. There are no credit ratings related triggers in our Credit Agreement or in the indenture related to our Convertible Notes.            Working capital was $227.6 million as of December 27, 2003 and $216.1 million as of December 28, 2002. The increase of $11.5 million was primarily due to an increase in inventory of $39.4 million, partially offset by an increase of $27.5 million in accounts payable. These changes reflect the timing of pharmacy and front-end merchandise purchasing activity versus the previous year.            For fiscal 2003, net cash provided by operating activities was $47.4 million or 3.4% of sales, compared to $42.5 million, or 3.3% of sales in 2002. The primary reason for the increase was the lower rate of growth in working capital in 2003 over 2002 than experienced in 2002 over 2001.            For fiscal 2003, net cash used in investing activities was $55.1 million, compared to $60.5 million in fiscal 2002. Net cash used in investing activities in 2003 was for capital expenditures of $41.0 million, primarily related to the opening and remodeling of new and renovated stores, combined with $12.7 million for lease, pharmacy file and other acquisition costs and $1.4 million associated with the    31          completion of a store acquisition initiated in 2001. Net cash used in investing activities in 2002 was due to capital expenditures of $47.6 million and $12.9 million for lease, pharmacy file and other acquisition costs. The decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to a reduction in the number of store openings from 32 in 2002 to 17 in 2003, partially offset by increased capital expenditures in 2003 for technology related projects.            For fiscal 2003, net cash provided by financing activities was $4.7 million, compared to $17.2 million in fiscal 2002. The lower levels of cash provided by financing activities in 2003 resulted from the improved level of cash flow from operating activities combined with decreased capital expenditures reflective of the less aggressive store expansion program employed in 2003.            Our investing requirements primarily result from opening and stocking new stores, remodeling and renovating existing retail locations, purchasing pharmacy files and from the continuing development of management information systems. We believe that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores, and currently plan to open approximately 25 to 30 new stores during the next two years. This represents a decline from the 49 stores we opened in the two years ended December 27, 2003. We expect to spend approximately $40 million in fiscal 2004 on capital expenditures, primarily for new and replacement stores and an additional $14 million for lease and pharmacy file acquisitions and other costs. We also require working capital to support inventory for our existing stores. Historically, we have been able to lease our store locations.            Leases for 10 of our stores that generated approximately 4.1% of our net sales for fiscal 2003 are scheduled to expire before the end of fiscal 2005. One of these leases has a renewal option. We believe that we will be able to renew the other expiring leases on economically favorable terms or, alternatively, find other economically attractive locations to lease.             As of December 27, 2003, approximately 5,600 of our approximately 6,100 employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreements covering these employees, we are required, in some instances, to pay specified annual increases in salary and benefits contributions relating to the member employees. We do not believe that these increases will have a material impact on our liquidity or results of operations.            Under an employment agreement with our Chairman and CEO negotiated during fiscal 2002, we are required to fund premiums for a split dollar life insurance policy that will provide certain post-retirement benefits. During fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, the premiums amounted to $4.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, and are scheduled to remain at $5.0 million per year through 2010. The premiums have been established at a level anticipated to be sufficient to cover the full amount of the projected retirement benefits, as well as to return the full cost of the premiums plus a 3% rate of interest to us. Recent Sarbanes-Oxley legislation has resulted in the need for additional guidance concerning the permissibility of split dollar life insurance policies for executives. While we believe this split dollar policy is permitted under current interpretations of the legislation, there can be no assurance that further interpretations or guidance to be provided by the SEC concerning this legislation will concur.             Our planned acquisition by Duane Reade Acquisition will be financed as an all cash transaction whereby our stockholders will receive $17.00 per share outstanding, without interest, on the date of the closing, which is expected to occur during the second calendar quarter of 2004. The total transaction value, including the repayment of indebtedness and transaction-related expenses is approximately $740 million, which will be funded through new equity investments of approximately $240 million and debt of approximately $500 million. Upon closing, we expect to have approximately $90 million of borrowing availability under an amended asset-based revolving credit agreement and no debt amortization requirements until July 2008.    32                  We believe that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement, will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, to fund anticipated capital expenditures and to satisfy our working capital requirements. We base this belief on our existing levels of cash flow from operations of approximately $40 million annually and significant additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement which amounted to over $120 million at December 27, 2003. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that our operating results, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. Such risks that could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations include but are not limited to reductions in third party prescription reimbursement rates, further declines in the New York City economy, increases in competitive activity, additional business adverse legislative changes or a major disruption of business in our markets from a terrorist event or natural disaster. Our borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates. Therefore, our financial condition will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates.            The following table provides additional information with respect to our Commitments and Obligations:       Payments due by Period   (dollars in thousands)      Contractual Cash Obligations       Total     Within  1 year     2-3 years     4-5 years     After  5 years    Long-Term Debt (1)     $  271,385     $       $       $  70,353     $  201,032    Capital Lease Obligations (2)        1,525        422        969        134            Operating Leases (3)        1,195,354        111,028        219,048        202,006        663,272    CEO Split Dollar Life Insurance Policy (4)        35,000        5,000        10,000        10,000        10,000                             Total Contractual Cash Obligations     $  1,503,264     $  116,450     $  230,017     $  282,493     $  874,304                                 (1) At December 27, 2003, this represented the outstanding balance of our revolving Credit Agreement ($70.4 million), combined with the outstanding balance of our 2.1478% Senior Convertible Notes due 2022 ($201.0 million), as further detailed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements provides further detail on Capital Lease Obligations. (3) Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements provides further detail on Operating Lease Obligations. (4) Recent Sarbanes-Oxley legislation has resulted in the need for additional guidance concerning the permissibility of split dollar life insurance policies for executives. While we believe this split dollar policy is permitted under current interpretations of the legislation there can be no assurance that further interpretations or guidance to be provided by the SEC concerning this legislation will concur. Under certain circumstances, including a change of control event or failure to renew Mr. Cuti's current employment agreement which expires on December 31, 2004, we will be obligated to prepay a sufficient portion of any remaining unpaid split dollar policy premium payments to ensure that Mr. Cuti's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") benefits will be fully funded. The undiscounted sum of the six remaining annual premium payments and cash surrender value of the policy available to pay Mr. Cuti's SERP benefits were $30.0 million   33          and $13.9 million, respectively, as of March 4, 2004. The estimated present value of Mr. Cuti's SERP benefit was approximately $15.5 million at December 27, 2003.

The largest of these agreements is with AmerisourceBergen, our primary pharmaceutical supplier. Generally, these agreements provide for certain volume commitments and may be terminated by us, subject in some cases to specified termination payments, none of which would constitute a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. It is the opinion of management that if any of these agreements were terminated or if any contracting party was to experience events precluding fulfillment of its obligations, we would be able to find a suitable alternative supplier.            In addition to Mr. Cuti's SERP benefits discussed above, in the event of a change of control or our failure to renew Mr. Cuti's current employment agreement that expires on December 31, 2004, we will be required to pay severance benefits equal to five times the "earnings amount" of approximately $4.1 million (based upon the sum of Mr. Cuti's current annual salary, maximum incentive bonus and a supplemental non-compete payment).             At December 27, 2003 we recorded a litigation-related non-current liability of $12.6 million in connection with a National Labor Relations Board Administrative Law Judge recommendation in a litigation-related matter with the Allied Trades Council, a union representing employees in 139 of our stores. Because this recommendation is only the initial phase of a complex administrative and judicial process, the ultimate outcome, financial impact and related timing of any future cash disbursement relating to this matter can not be determined at this time. This matter is more fully described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.             We are not a party to any agreements with, or commitments to, any special purpose entities that would constitute material off-balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments listed above.    Critical Accounting Policies             Our discussion of results of operations and financial condition relies on our consolidated financial statements that are prepared based on certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgments and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. We believe that investors need to be aware of these policies and how they impact our financial reporting to gain a more complete understanding of our consolidated financial statements as a whole, as well as our related discussion and analysis presented herein. While we believe that these accounting policies are grounded on sound measurement criteria, actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates or forecasts. The accounting policies and related risks    34          described in the paragraphs below are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and estimates.              SIZE=2> Pharmacy ReceivablesReserves for Uncollectible Accounts At December 27, 2003, accounts receivable included $37.0 million of amounts due from various insurance companies and governmental agencies under third party payment plans for prescription sales made prior to the year-end date. Our accounting policy is to fully reserve for all pharmacy receivables over 120 days old that are unpaid at the evaluation date, as well as any others deemed potentially uncollectible. This policy is based on our past collection experience. There was approximately $3.3 million reserved for uncollectible pharmacy receivables at December 27, 2003. In addition, we reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables due from our merchandise vendors based upon our historical collection experience. At December 27, 2003, this reserve was approximately $1.3 million.             SIZE=2> Inventory Shrink Estimates We take front-end and pharmacy physical inventories in all of our stores and the distribution centers at least once per year on a staggered cycle basis. Inventories at balance sheet dates are valued using the specific-cost, item-based last-in, first-out (LIFO) method reduced by estimated inventory shrink losses for the period between the last physical inventory in each store and the balance sheet date. These shrink estimates are based on the latest chain-wide trends. At December 27, 2003, a change in this shrink estimate of 1.0% of front-end sales would impact current year pre-tax earnings by approximately $3.4 million.             SIZE=2> Insurance Liabilities and Reserves At December 27, 2003, there were $1.9 million of accrued general liability claim costs that primarily related to our self-insured portion of customer accident claims. Our policy is to recognize a liability for the estimated self-insured portion of the projected ultimate settlement value of these claims as well as a provision for incurred but unreported claims as of each balance sheet date. These estimates are made based on a review of the facts and circumstances of each individual claim using experienced third party claims adjustors. These estimates are also reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis by management. For the vast majority of claims, the maximum self-insured portion of any individual claim amounts to $100,000, however, our historical claim settlement experience is significantly lower. At December 27, 2003, there were 208 outstanding claims with an average projected settlement value of approximately $9,400, as compared to 259 outstanding claims with an average projected settlement value of $9,600 at December 28, 2002.             SIZE=2> Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 27, 2003, goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, amounted to approximately $161.3 million. Other net intangible assets consisted of lease acquisition costs of $34.2 million, customer lists of $19.5 million and non-compete agreements amounting to $0.7 million. Our policy is to evaluate our intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill, for impairment as of the year-end balance sheet date, or, if applicable, when circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition or the loss of key personnel. We evaluate our intangible assets for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows from the underlying stores or assets over their remaining asset lives to the net intangible asset values. Any intangible asset for which the projected undiscounted cash flow is insufficient to recover the asset's carrying value is considered impaired and would be written down to its net recoverable value. Such write-downs would result in a non-cash charge to earnings. Based upon our anticipated future revenues and cash flows and the net intangible asset balances existing at December 27, 2003, all stores are projected to recover their intangible asset values within their useful lives. Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No 142. We utilize the market capitalization of our common stock in performing the required impairment test. Our most recent evaluation did not indicate any impairment of goodwill; however, we may be required to perform an interim impairment review if circumstances similar to those listed above indicate that impairment may have occurred. We may be required to recognize an impairment charge at the time an interim or future annual impairment review    35          is performed, depending in part on the value of our market capitalization. Upon completion of the planned acquisition by Duane Reade Acquisition, we will be required to assign current market values to all of our assets and liabilities, which is expected to result in changes to our current carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets.             SIZE=2> Other Loss Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies often take years to resolve and can involve complicated litigation matters and potential regulatory actions, the outcomes of which are difficult to predict. At December 27, 2003, we have recorded two loss contingencies, representing (1) the estimated liability associated with a National Labor Relations Board Administrative Law Judge recommendation in a litigation-related matter with the Allied Trades Council, a union representing employees in 139 of our stores. This is more fully described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements; and (2) our estimated portion of a potential settlement of an ongoing lawsuit between various retailers and a delivery drivers union.              SIZE=2> Income Taxes Our effective tax rate declined to 30.1% for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2003 from 36.3% in fiscal 2002. The effective tax rate has been and is expected to continue to be a major factor in the determination of our profitability and cash flow. As such, a significant shift in the relative sources of our earnings, or changes in tax rules or interpretations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. The decrease in our effective rate in 2003 as compared to 2002 is attributable to the impact of employment tax credits on significantly reduced pre-tax income, partially offset by incremental tax expense recorded in connection with New York State legislation enacted in the second quarter of 2003, with retroactive application to January 1, 2003, that eliminated deductions for royalty fee expenses paid to out of state affiliated companies.    Change in Accounting Method             During the first quarter of 2002, we adopted a change in accounting method to convert from the retail dollar-based first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method of inventory valuation to an item specific cost-based last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method of inventory valuation. This change resulted in a one-time non-cash after-tax charge of approximately $9.3 million, which was recorded in the first quarter of the 2002 fiscal year as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Adoption of the specific cost LIFO method has resulted in the recognition of the latest item costs in our reported gross margins, and has made our results more comparable to other major retailers in our industry.    Seasonality             The non-pharmacy business is seasonal in nature, with the Christmas holiday season generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other periods. Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements illustrates our quarterly results and provides an indication of the impact of seasonality on our results of operations.     Inflation             We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations during the three years ended December 27, 2003.    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements             During the first quarter of 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." Under FAS No. 145, gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt should no longer be segregated on the income statement as extraordinary items. Rather, such gains and losses should be included as a component of income from continuing operations. The provisions of FAS    36          No. 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Upon adoption, we reclassified from extraordinary charges to debt extinguishment costs, for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, pre-tax amounts of $11.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively. The income tax provisions for the 2002 and 2001 fiscal years applicable to income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change were adjusted commensurately. Reported net income remained unaffected by the reclassification, and thus, this adoption did not have an impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.            During the first quarter of 2003, we adopted FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." This statement supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." FAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. The provisions of FAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS No. 146 did not have an impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.            In September 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force released Issue No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor." The pronouncement addresses two issues. The first issue requires that vendor allowances be categorized as a reduction in cost of sales unless they are a reimbursement of costs incurred to sell the vendor's products, in which case, the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost. Cash consideration received in excess of the fair value of the benefit provided should be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales. Transition provisions for this portion of the pronouncement apply to all agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. As a result of the application of this portion of the pronouncement, we changed our accounting policy to limit vendor allowances treated as a reduction of advertising costs to only those allowances paid by vendors to fund the costs of running specific radio advertising promotions. All other promotional advertising allowances are treated as a reduction in cost of sales. The application of this new accounting policy did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The second issue requires that rebates or refunds payable only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases should be recognized as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation over the period during which such purchases are sold. This provision was required to be applied to all new arrangements initiated after November 21, 2002 and was consistent with our historical practice.            In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN No. 45 clarifies the requirements of FAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," relating to a guarantor's accounting for and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. FIN No. 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor's obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The recognition provisions of FIN No. 45 are effective for certain guarantees issued after January 1, 2003. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.             In December 2002, FAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure" was issued. This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. We have    37          not adopted such voluntary change to the fair value based method. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. As required, we adopted the disclosure-only provisions of FAS No. 148 effective in 2002.            In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FIN No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. As initially issued, the consolidation requirements of FIN No. 46 applied immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and, for older entities, in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. In addition, certain of the disclosure requirements applied in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The FASB, at their October 8, 2003 meeting, deferred the latest date by which all public entities must apply FIN 46 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003, with early adoption encouraged. In December 2003, the FASB published a revision to FIN 46 ("FIN 46R") to clarify some of the provisions of FIN 46, and to exempt certain entities from its requirements. We do not have any variable interest entities that would require consolidation under FIN 46 and FIN 46R. The adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.    NAME="de3200_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02676">      ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MARKET RISK                 Our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt that carries variable interest rates. Variable rate debt outstanding under our Credit Agreement was approximately $70.4 million at December 27, 2003. At December 27, 2003, the weighted average combined interest rate in effect on all borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 2.90%. A 0.50% change in interest rates applied to the $70.4 million balance of floating rate debt existing at December 27, 2003 would affect pre-tax annual results of operations by approximately $0.4 million. In addition, we also have $201.0 million of Convertible Notes outstanding at December 27, 2003. These notes bear interest payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 3.75%, and are therefore not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations.            The principal objective of our investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to facilitate our funding needs. As part of our risk management, we may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps in the future.    38         NAME="de3200_item_8._financial_statements_and_supplementary_data">      ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
