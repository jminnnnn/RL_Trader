ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS              The following should be read in connection with all consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this report.    General             We generate revenues primarily through sales of over-the-counter and prescription pharmaceutical products, health and beauty care products, food and beverage items, tobacco products, cosmetics, housewares, hosiery, greeting cards, photofinishing, photo supplies and seasonal merchandise. Health and beauty care products, including over-the-counter drugs, represent our highest volume product    15           categories. Our primary costs and expenses are (1) inventory costs, (2) labor expenses and (3) occupancy costs.            We achieved sales per square foot of $818 in fiscal 2001 and $847 in fiscal 2000. We believe that sales per square foot is a useful measure of comparing our performance to that of our competitors because it is a measure of a store's sales productivity. We currently expect that our sales per square foot may decline as we continue with our plan to increase new store openings during fiscal 2002. The opening of these additional stores may result in a decline in sales per square foot principally because (1) the average square footage for new stores will often be greater than that of the existing store base and (2) new stores generally take some time to reach a mature level of sales. We believe that our competitors in the industry experience increases and decreases in sales per square foot for similar reasons. Over the next two years, we plan to open 60 to 70 stores, of which approximately two-thirds will be located outside of Manhattan. There are no future plans for any significant number of store closings.            Our primary assets are our ownership of 99% of the outstanding partnership interest of Duane Reade, a New York general partnership, and ownership of all of the outstanding common stock of DRI I Inc. DRI I Inc. owns the remaining 1% partnership interest in Duane Reade. Substantially all of our operations are conducted through Duane Reade. In August 1999, we established two new subsidiaries, Duane Reade International and Duane Reade Realty. Duane Reade distributed to Duane Reade Inc. and DRI I Inc. all rights, title, and interest in all its trademarks, trade names and all other intellectual property rights. In turn, Duane Reade Inc. and DRI I Inc. made a capital contribution of these intellectual property rights to Duane Reade International. This change created a controlled system to manage and exploit these intellectual property rights separate and apart from the retail operations. In addition, Duane Reade distributed some of its store leases to Duane Reade Inc. and DRI I Inc., which in turn made a capital contribution of these leases to Duane Reade Realty. Duane Reade Realty is the lessee under certain store leases entered into after its creation. Duane Reade Realty subleases to Duane Reade the properties subject to those leases. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein reflect the accounts of Duane Reade Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.    Results of Operations             On September 11, 2001, a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center complex in downtown Manhattan resulted in the total destruction of that landmark and significant disruption of commerce throughout the entire city, within which most of our stores are located. The attack resulted in the complete loss of two stores, one of which was in the top tier of our stores based on sales volume and profit contribution. Also, as a result of this disaster and the related disruptions within our market in the period following the disaster, we reported significant declines in sales and earnings growth trends from the levels achieved prior to the disaster.            Over the 16 weeks in 2001 subsequent to the disaster, we estimate lost sales of approximately $27.0 million, primarily in higher margin front-end sales, and reduced net earnings of approximately $6.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. We are insured for our property losses, extra costs to re-establish operations and business interruption losses. To date, we have collected $2.5 million in insurance recoveries for our property losses, of which $2.0 million was received subsequent to the December 29, 2001 year end. The results discussed below include all business interruption losses incurred over the period subsequent to the disaster with no provision for insurance recoveries other than the cost of our physical property losses and covered extra expenses to re-establish operations. We have submitted our business interruption claim, which is material in amount, to the insurance carrier, and we expect the required adjusting process for the settlement of this claim to continue well into the second half of this year. Specific areas of our reported results materially impacted by this disaster are included in our management discussion and analysis of financial condition provided below.    16        NAME="page_bm3343_1_17">               The following sets forth the results of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated.             2001     2000     1999       Net sales     100.0   %  100.0   %  100.0  %    Cost of sales     76.2     74.6     74.0                           Gross profit     23.8     25.4     26.0       Selling, general & administrative expenses     15.1     15.6     16.2       Depreciation and amortization     2.3     2.3     2.6       Store pre-opening expenses     0.2     0.1     0.2                           Operating income     6.2     7.4     7.0       Net interest expense     2.4     3.6     3.5                           Income before income taxes     3.8     3.8     3.5       Income tax benefit (expense)     (1.5  )  (1.5  )  1.3                           Income before extraordinary charge     2.3     2.3     4.8       Extraordinary charge     (0.1  )                                  Net income (loss)     2.2  %  2.3  %  4.8  %                           Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000             Net sales in the 52-week year ended December 29, 2001 were $1.14 billion, an increase of 14.3% over the 53-week year ended December 30, 2000 sales of $1.00 billion. On a comparable 52-week basis, net sales in 2001 increased 16.3% over the same period in 2000. The increases were due to increased comparable store sales of 6.3% and the inclusion of 24 stores opened during 2000 for the entire 2001 period and 28 net new stores opened in 2001. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to improved pharmacy sales, which increased to 39.2% of total sales in 2001 compared to 35.4% of total sales in 2000. Pharmacy sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth rates versus front-end sales. Pharmacy and front-end comparable sales increased by 16.6% and 0.6%, respectively.            Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 76.2% for 2001 from 74.6% for 2000, resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to 23.8% for 2001 from 25.4% for 2000. Cost of goods sold in 2001 includes two unusual items, a loss of $2.6 million from the early termination of a supply agreement and a gain of $1.4 million from the sale of a few stores' customer lists. The combined net loss of $1.2 million for these unusual items represented 0.1% of sales in 2001. The balance of the gross margin decline primarily resulted from the low front-end comparable store growth rate of 0.6% and the faster growth rate of lower margin pharmacy sales. The low growth rate in comparable front-end sales for the year was primarily attributable to the impact of customer disruptions in the aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster, the recessionary economy in the second half of the year and a mild flu season in the fourth quarter that depressed sales of cough and cold categories. Lower margin pharmacy sales benefited in the fourth quarter from increased demand for ciprofloxacin as a result of anthrax scares, as well as higher rates of sales in certain sleep aids and anti-depressants. Gross profit was also adversely impacted by the loss of front-end sales related allowances in the period following the World Trade Center disaster.            Selling, general and administrative expenses were $173.0 million, or 15.1% of net sales, and $155.6 million, or 15.6% of net sales, in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of sales reflects improved efficiencies and additional expense leveraging against new store sales, as well as a reduction in earnings-based incentive compensation and benefit costs.            Depreciation and amortization of intangibles in 2001 and 2000 was $26.6 million and $23.2 million, respectively. The increase was attributable to capital spending for property and equipment during 2000    17           and 2001, primarily in support of new store growth as well as amortization expenses for goodwill, pharmacy customer lists and lease acquisition costs for acquisitions completed during 2000 and 2001.            Store pre-opening expenses of $1.7 million related to the opening of 31 stores in 2001 as compared to $1.4 million reflecting 24 store openings in 2000.            Net interest expense decreased to $27.6 million in 2001 from $35.9 million in 2000. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to the $130.4 million of proceeds from the June, 2001 Equity Offering that were used to reduce term loan and revolver borrowings and lower interest rates on the floating rate portion of our revolving credit facility during 2001, as well as one less week in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. This was partially offset by increased revolver borrowings attributable to the lost sales and earnings in the aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster.            Our income before income taxes increased 13.5% to $43.5 million in 2001 from $38.3 million in 2000.            During 2001, we recorded an income tax provision of $17.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 43.0%, reduced by certain wage-related income tax credits amounting to $1.4 million. During 2000, we recorded an income tax provision of $15.6 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 42.9%, reduced by wage-related income tax credits totaling $0.8 million.            Net income was $24.7 million in 2001 and $22.7 million in 2000. The increase of $2.0 million is a result of the increase in pre-tax income of $5.2 million in 2001 versus 2000, partially offset by the incremental income tax provision of $1.6 million and the after-tax extraordinary charge of $1.5 million in 2001, reflecting the write-off of deferred financing costs as a result of the June, 2001 early retirement of debt.     Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999             Net sales in the 53-week year ended December 30, 2000 were $1.0 billion, an increase of 19.1% over the 52-week year ended December 25, 1999 sales of $839.8 million. On a comparable 52-week basis, net sales in 2000 increased 17.0% over the same period in 1999. The increase was due to increased comparable store sales of 7.3% and the inclusion of 21 stores opened during 1999 for the entire 2000 period and 23 net new stores opened in 2000. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to improved pharmacy sales, which increased to 35.4% of total sales in 2000 compared to 31.9% of total sales in 1999. Pharmacy sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth rates versus front-end sales. Pharmacy and front-end comparable sales increased by 18.8% and 1.8%, respectively.            Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 74.6% for 2000 from 74.0% for 1999, resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to 25.4% for 2000 from 26.0% for 1999. The decrease in gross margin resulted principally from the faster growth rate of lower margin pharmacy sales and the inclusion of the 53 rd  week in 2000, which included a significant portion of post-holiday markdowns not included in the previous 52-week year.            Selling, general and administrative expenses were $155.6 million, or 15.6% of net sales, and $135.8 million, or 16.2% of net sales, in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of sales reflects the favorable leveraging of store operating costs from maturing retail sites, as well as the leveraging of general and administrative expenses against new and comparative store sales growth.            Depreciation and amortization of intangibles in 2000 and 1999 was $23.2 million and $21.4 million, respectively. The increase was attributable to capital spending for property and equipment during 1999 and 2000 as well as amortization expenses for goodwill, pharmacy customer lists and lease acquisition costs for acquisitions completed during 1999 and 2000. This was partially offset by reduced amortization    18           expenses related to a $22.2 million reduction of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 1999, and a change in the estimated useful life of pharmacy customer list acquisitions from 5 to 7 years.            Store pre-opening expenses of $1.4 million related to the opening of 24 stores in 2000 as compared to $1.5 million reflecting 21 store openings in 1999.             Net interest expense increased to $35.9 million in 2000 from $29.3 million in 1999. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher levels of average borrowings and higher interest rates during 2000.            Our income before income taxes increased 26.7% to $38.3 million in 2000 from $30.2 million in 1999.            During 2000, we recorded an income tax provision of $15.6 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 42.9%, partially offset by certain wage-related income tax credits. During 1999, we recorded an income tax benefit of $10.5 million due to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation reserves of $30.8 million.             We recorded net income of $22.7 million in 2000, compared to net income of $40.7 million in 1999. The decrease of $18.0 million is a result of the income tax benefit of $10.5 million recorded in 1999 as compared to the income tax provision of $15.6 million recorded in 2000, partially offset by the increase in pre-tax income of $8.1 million in 2000 versus 1999.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             On June 13, 2001, we successfully completed a follow-on equity offering (the "2001 Offering") of 8,050,000 shares of common stock, including 4,000,000 primary shares and 4,050,000 secondary shares from selling stockholders. The primary shares were sold for net proceeds of $32.84 per share that resulted in $130.4 million in proceeds to us after deducting various expenses related to the offering. We also received $0.5 million from the exercise of certain selling shareholders' stock options in connection with the sale of the secondary shares. These proceeds were used to reduce term loan and revolver borrowings, resulting in a reduction of debt at June 13, 2001 from $373.5 million to $242.0 million.            In connection with the completed equity offering, on July 10, 2001, we entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("the Restated Credit Agreement"). The Restated Credit Agreement resulted in a refinancing of our outstanding Term B and Term C loans into a new Term B loan with reduced LIBOR margins and an extended maturity date. The Restated Credit Agreement was made possible as a result of the completed offering and related improvement in our leverage ratios. As of December 29, 2001, the outstanding balances of the Term A and Term B loans were $17.3 million and $138.8 million, respectively. The LIBOR margin on the new Term B loan was reduced to 2.50% from 3.00% on the Term B and Term C loans in effect prior to the refinancing. Additionally, the Restated Credit Agreement provides for an increase in permitted revolver borrowings from $60.0 million to $100.0 million of which $80.0 million was made available as of the date of the refinancing. At December 29, 2001, there was $10.0 million of outstanding revolver borrowings and $0.8 million of standby letters of credit, leaving $69.2 million of availability. Annual permitted capital expenditures were increased from $30.0 to $50.0 million in this Restated Credit Agreement, and certain restrictive covenants were modified to provide us with additional flexibility. Our revolver and Term A loans under our Restated Credit Agreement expire on February 15, 2004, and our Term B loan expires on February 15, 2007. We expect to be able to replace the revolving and Term A portions of our Restated Credit Agreement under terms that are approximately equivalent to those currently in effect.            Working capital was $214.1 million as of December 29, 2001 and $154.5 million as of December 30, 2000. The increase of $59.6 million was primarily due to inventory and accounts receivable increases of $48.1 million and $12.8 million respectively. The inventory increase resulted from purchases of inventory required to support the opening of 31 additional stores during 2001, as well as increases in owned pharmacy inventory above a consignment limit of $30.0 million, under the    19           agreement with our primary pharmacy supplier. Increased inventory also related to earlier purchases of spring holiday merchandise in advance of an earlier Easter holiday in 2002. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to significantly higher sales volumes of third party reimbursed prescriptions that is consistent with the general industry trend.            Our EBITDA increased by $0.7 million, or 0.7%, to $102.1 million in 2001 compared to $101.4 million in 2000. EBITDA as a percentage of sales was 8.9% in 2001, compared to 10.1% in 2000. The reduced EBITDA margin was primarily attributable to lower gross profit margins as discussed above.            For fiscal 2001, net cash provided by operating activities was $25.8 million, compared to $22.1 million for fiscal 2000. The primary reason for the increase was increased cash earnings partially offset by increases in working capital related to inventory for new stores and increased accounts receivable.             For fiscal 2001, net cash used in investing activities was $48.1 million, compared to $32.6 million in fiscal 2000. Net cash used in investing activities in 2001 was for capital expenditures of $41.0 million, primarily related to the opening and remodeling of new and renovated stores, combined with $8.5 million for lease, pharmacy file and other acquisition costs, partially offset by $1.4 million of proceeds generated by the sale of certain stores' customer files. Net cash used in investing activities in 2000 was due to capital expenditures of $29.7 million and $2.9 million for lease, pharmacy file and other acquisition costs.            For fiscal 2001, net cash provided by financing activities was $26.3 million, compared to $10.5 million in fiscal 2000. The higher levels of cash provided by financing activities in 2001 resulted from increased capital expenditures to support increased levels of new store growth and higher levels of cash spending for lease, pharmacy file and other acquisition costs. Proceeds of $130.4 million from the June, 2001 common stock offering were used to repay a portion of our outstanding senior debt.            Our capital requirements primarily result from opening and stocking new stores, remodeling and renovating existing retail locations and from the continuing development of management information systems. We believe that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores, and currently plan to open approximately 60 to 70 stores during the next two years. We expect to spend approximately $48.0 million in fiscal 2002 on capital expenditures, primarily for new and replacement stores and an additional $8.5 million for lease and pharmacy file acquisition and other costs. We also require working capital to support inventory for our existing stores. Historically, we have been able to lease our store locations.            Leases for 16 of our stores that generated approximately 6.4% of our net sales for fiscal 2001 are scheduled to expire before the end of fiscal 2003. Four of these leases have renewal options. We believe that we will be able to renew the other expiring leases on economically favorable terms or, alternatively, find other economically attractive locations to lease.            As of December 29, 2001, approximately 4,000 of our approximately 5,100 employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreements covering these employees, we are required, in some instances, to pay specified annual increases in salary and benefits contributions relating to the member employees. We do not believe that these increases will have a material impact on our liquidity or results of operations.            We believe that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including additional borrowings under our credit agreement, will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the terms of our debt agreements. As of December 29, 2001, we had borrowed $10.0 million under the revolving portion of our Restated Credit Agreement and had    20           approximately $69.2 million of remaining availability. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that our operating results, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. Substantially all of our borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates. Therefore, our financial condition will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates.            At December 29, 2001, there were $5.6 million of receivables related to recoverable property losses and extra costs to reopen stores that were temporarily closed due to the disruptions related to the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center disaster. We have received $2.0 million in insurance proceeds subsequent to the balance sheet date that represents partial payment for these losses and we expect to receive the balance within the first half of the current year. We have also submitted our business interruption claim, which is material in amount, and expect that the required process of adjusting this claim will continue into the second half of this year. The above liquidity assessment does not assume any additional insurance recoveries above those already collected to date.            The Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit or restrict, among other things, subject to certain exceptions, capital expenditures, the incurrence of indebtedness, the creation of liens, transactions with affiliates, restricted payments, investments and acquisitions, mergers, consolidations, dissolutions, asset sales, dividends, distributions and certain other transactions and business activities.            Financial performance covenants include interest coverage, leverage ratios, minimum net worth requirements and fixed charge coverage. At December 29, 2001, we were in compliance with all financial performance covenants. There are no credit ratings related triggers in our Restated Credit Agreement or in the Indenture governing our 9 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "Senior Note Indenture") that would impact cost of borrowing, annual amortization of principal or related debt maturities.            On December 20, 2000, we entered into a two-year interest rate swap in the notional amount of $150.0 million. This swap had an effective date of January 12, 2001 and represented a hedging transaction whereby we would receive interest at a floating rate and pay interest at a fixed LIBOR rate. The effect of this swap is to fix our interest obligations on $150.0 million of floating rate debt for two years at a LIBOR rate of 5.8075% plus the applicable margins as defined in the credit agreement (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). This agreement expires on January 13, 2003.            The following table provides additional information with respect to our Commitments and Obligations:       Payments due by Period      Contractual Cash Obligations       Total     Within  1 year     2-3 years     4-5 years     After  5 years          (Dollars in thousands)      Long-Term Debt(1)     $  246,159     $  7,758     $  23,765     $  2,790     $  211,846    Capital Lease Obligations(2)        996        820        176                    Operating Leases(3)        1,032,622        85,882        174,826        168,954        602,960                             Total Contractual Cash Obligations     $  1,279,777     $  94,460     $  198,767     $  171,744     $  814,806                                 (1) At December 29, 2001, this represented the outstanding balance of term loans ($156.2 million) and revolving credit borrowings ($10.0 million) under our Restated Credit Agreement, combined with the outstanding balance of our 9.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 ($80.0 million), as further detailed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The largest of these is with AmerisourceBergen, the Company's primary pharmaceutical supplier. Generally, these agreements provide for certain volume commitments and are terminable by us, subject in some cases to specified termination payments, none of which would constitute a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. It is the opinion of management that if any of these agreements were terminated or if any contracting party was to experience events precluding fulfillment of its obligations, we would be able to find a suitable alternative supplier.            We are not a party to any agreements with, or commitments to, any special purpose entities that would constitute material off balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments listed above.    Critical Accounting Policies             Our discussion of results of operations and financial condition relies on our consolidated financial statements that are prepared based on certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgements and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. We believe that investors need to be aware of these policies and how they impact our financial reporting to gain a more complete understanding of our consolidated financial statements as a whole, as well as our related discussion and analysis presented herein. While we believe that these accounting policies are grounded on sound measurement criteria, actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates or forecasts. The accounting policies and related risks described in the paragraphs below are those that depend most heavily on these judgements and estimates.             SIZE=2> Pharmacy ReceivablesReserves for Uncollectible Accounts At December 29, 2001, accounts receivable included $31.9 million of amounts due from various insurance companies and governmental agencies under third party payment plans for prescription sales made prior to the year-end date. Our accounting policy is to fully reserve for all unpaid pharmacy receivables over 120 days old, as well as any others deemed potentially uncollectible. This policy is based on our past collection experience. Our uncollectible pharmacy receivable losses amounted to $2.4 million in fiscal 2001 and there was approximately $1.7 million reserved for uncollectible pharmacy receivables at December 29, 2001.    22                  SIZE=2> Inventory Shrink Estimates We take front-end physical inventories in each of our stores and the distribution center twice per year on a staggered cycle basis. Front-end inventories at balance sheet dates are valued using the retail dollar based first in, first out (FIFO) method reduced by estimated inventory shrink losses for the period between the last physical inventory in each store and the balance sheet date. These shrink estimates are based on the latest chain-wide trends. At December 29, 2001, an understatement of this shrink estimate by 1.0% of front-end sales would result in a reduction in current year pre-tax earnings of approximately $2.0 million.             SIZE=2> Insurance Liabilities and Reserves At December 29, 2001, there were $2.2 million of accrued general liability claim costs that primarily related to our self-insured portion of customer accident claims. Our policy is to recognize a liability for the estimated self-insured portion of the projected ultimate settlement value of these claims as well as a provision for incurred but unreported claims as of each balance sheet date. These estimates are made based on a review of the facts and circumstances of each individual claim using experienced third party claims adjustors. These estimates are also reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis by management. Although the maximum self-insured portion of any individual claim amounts to $100,000, our historical claim settlement experience is significantly lower. At December 29, 2001, there were 172 outstanding claims with an average projected settlement value of approximately $13,000.             SIZE=2> Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 29, 2001, goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, amounted to approximately $158.4 million. Other net intangible assets consisted of lease acquisition costs of $28.8 million, customer lists of $18.1 million and non-compete agreements amounting to $1.2 million. Our policy is to evaluate these acquired assets for impairment as of each balance sheet date by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows from the underlying stores or assets over their remaining asset lives to the net intangible asset values. Any intangible asset for which the projected undiscounted cash flow is insufficient to recover the asset's carrying value is considered impaired and would be written down to its net recoverable value. Such write-downs would result in a non- cash charge to earnings. The September 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center had a significant adverse impact upon our third and fourth quarter's earnings, gross margins and cash flow. Despite this impact, there were no goodwill or intangible asset impairments in our December 29, 2001 evaluation. The projected future cash flows used in this evaluation reflected a gradual improvement in our sales, margins and cash flows during the current year as the rebuilding process in New York City expands in scope. The average period of cash flow recovery determined in this test was within 2.5 years, and all stores are projected to recover their intangible asset values within their useful lives.             SIZE=2> Other Loss Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies often take years to resolve and can involve complicated litigation matters and potential regulatory actions, the outcomes of which are difficult to predict. At December 29, 2001, there were no loss contingency liabilities that we considered probable and reasonably estimable.    Accounting Change             During the first quarter of 2002, we plan to adopt a change in accounting method to convert from our current retail dollar based first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method of inventory valuation to an item specific cost based last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method of inventory valuation. This change is expected to result in a separate one-time non-cash after tax charge of approximately $9.0 million to be recorded in the first quarter. In addition, expected 2002 inflation in inventory acquisition costs will likely result in increased charges to cost of goods to be sold during 2002. We estimate that a 1.0% inflation in the annual inventory acquisition costs in 2002 would approximate a $1.2 million reduction in fiscal 2002 net earnings. Adoption of the specific cost LIFO method will result in the recognition of the latest item costs in our reported gross margins, and will make our results more comparable to other major    23          retailers in our industry. In an inflationary period, the LIFO method also has the added favorable impact of increasing cash flow through reduced income taxes.     Seasonality             The non-pharmacy business is seasonal in nature, with the Christmas holiday season generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other periods. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an illustration of the effect of seasonality on our results of operations.    Inflation             We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations during the three years ended December 29, 2001, although most recent data available indicates that there has been a modest increase in the overall inflation levels impacting our business. There can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material impact in the future.    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements             During the third quarter of 2001, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Pronouncements Nos. 141 (FAS 141) and 142 (FAS 142), "Business Combinations" and "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," respectively, for acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001. This adoption eliminated goodwill amortization for these acquisitions and did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.             Beginning in fiscal 2002, the application of these pronouncements will also eliminate amortization of goodwill for acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001. As a result, total company amortization expenses for 2002 are projected to decline by approximately $4.4 million.            FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" requires that derivative instruments such as options, forward contracts and swaps be recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and provides guidance for recognition of changes in fair value depending on the reason for holding the derivative. On December 20, 2000, we entered into a two-year interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $150.0 million, with an effective date of January 12, 2001. The agreement, which was entered into as an interest rate hedging transaction, effectively converted $150.0 million of floating rate debt to a fixed rate of interest based on LIBOR. We adopted Statement No. 133 in the first quarter of 2001, but this did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.    ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MARKET RISK             Our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt that carries variable interest rates. Variable rate debt outstanding under our Restated Credit Agreement was approximately $166.2 million at December 29, 2001. On December 20, 2000, we purchased a two-year interest rate swap in the notional amount of $150.0 million. This swap, which had an effective date of January 12, 2001, represented a hedging transaction to effectively convert $150.0 million of floating rate debt to a fixed rate. This fixed rate is equivalent to a LIBOR rate of 5.8075% plus the applicable margins described in our Restated Credit Agreement (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At December 29, 2001, the weighted average combined 30-day and 90-day LIBOR rate in effect on the $16.2 million balance of the floating rate term and revolving debt was 2.13%. A 0.50% change in interest rates applied to the $16.2 million balance of floating rate debt would affect pre-tax annual results of operations by less than $0.1 million. We also have $80.0 million of Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 outstanding at December 29, 2001, which bear interest payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 9.25%, and are therefore not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations.            The principal objective of our investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to facilitate our funding needs. As part of our risk management, we may use additional derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps in the future.    24       NAME="page_da3343_1_25">        ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
