ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS             The following should be read in connection with all consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this report.     General             We generate revenues primarily through sales of over-the-counter and prescription pharmaceutical products, health and beauty care products, food and beverage items, tobacco products, cosmetics, housewares, hosiery, greeting cards, photofinishing, photo supplies and seasonal merchandise. Health and beauty care products, including over-the-counter drugs, represent our highest volume product categories. Our primary costs and expenses are inventory costs, labor expenses and occupancy costs.            We achieved sales per square foot of $836 in fiscal 2002, $818 in fiscal 2001 and $847 in fiscal 2000. We believe that sales per square foot is a useful measure of comparing our performance to that of our competitors because it is a measure of a store's sales productivity. Our sales per square foot may be subject to declines in the future as we continue to open large numbers of new stores. The opening of these additional stores may result in a decline in sales per square foot principally because (1) the average square footage for new stores will often be greater than that of the existing store base and (2) new stores generally take some time to reach a mature level of sales. We believe that our competitors in the industry experience increases and decreases in sales per square foot for similar reasons. Over the next two years, we plan to open 35 to 45 stores, of which we anticipate that approximately two-thirds will be located outside of Manhattan. There are no plans for any significant number of store closings.             Our primary assets are our ownership of 99% of the outstanding partnership interest of Duane Reade, a New York general partnership, and ownership of all of the outstanding common stock of DRI I Inc. DRI I Inc. owns the remaining 1% partnership interest in Duane Reade. Substantially all of our operations are conducted through Duane Reade. In August 1999, we established two new subsidiaries, Duane Reade International and Duane Reade Realty. Duane Reade distributed to Duane Reade Inc. and DRI I Inc. all rights, title, and interest in all its trademarks, trade names and all other intellectual property rights. In turn, Duane Reade Inc. and DRI I Inc. made a capital contribution of these intellectual property rights to Duane Reade International. This change created a controlled system to manage and exploit these intellectual property rights separate and apart from the retail operations. In addition, Duane Reade distributed some of its store leases to Duane Reade Inc. and DRI I Inc., which in turn made a capital contribution of these leases to Duane Reade Realty. Duane Reade Realty is the lessee under certain store leases entered into after its creation. Duane Reade Realty subleases to Duane Reade the properties subject to those leases. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein reflect the accounts of Duane Reade Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.     Results of Operations             On September 11, 2001, a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center complex in downtown Manhattan resulted in the total destruction of that landmark and significant disruption of commerce throughout the entire city, within which most of our stores are located. The attack resulted in the complete loss of two stores, one of which was our top performing store based on sales volume and profit contribution. Also, as a result of this disaster and the related disruptions within our market in the immediate quarter following the disaster, we reported significant declines in sales and earnings growth trends from the levels achieved prior to the disaster.             In fiscal 2002, we continued to be affected by the lost sales and profits resulting from the destruction of the two stores and the relocation of certain employers and customers from downtown Manhattan. This, combined with declines in the financial markets and the general recessionary    18          economy, continued to have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings performance. During fiscal 2002, we received insurance reimbursements for all of our remaining property losses associated with the September 11 disaster and approximately $9.4 million toward our business interruption claim that was recognized as a separate item of income in our attached financial statements. This business interruption recovery represented a partial payment of our losses and we are currently in litigation with the insurance carrier to recover the balance of our business interruption claim.            The following sets forth the results of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated.             2002     2001     2000       Net sales     100.0  %  100.0  %  100.0  %    Cost of sales     77.5     76.2     74.6                           Gross profit     22.5     23.8     25.4       Selling, general & administrative expenses     15.6     15.1     15.6       Insurance recovery     (0.7  )              Depreciation and amortization     2.1     2.3     2.3       Store pre-opening expenses     0.2     0.2     0.1                           Operating income     5.3     6.2     7.4       Net interest expense     1.4     2.4     3.6                           Income before income taxes, extraordinary charges and cumulative effect of accounting change     3.9     3.8     3.8       Income tax expense     (1.5  )  (1.5  )  (1.5  )                        Income before extraordinary charges and cumulative effect of accounting change     2.4     2.3     2.3       Extraordinary charges, net     (0.5  )  (0.1  )         Cumulative effect of accounting change, net     (0.7  )                                  Net income     1.2  %  2.2  %  2.3  %                           Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001             Net sales in the year ended December 28, 2002 were $1.27 billion, an increase of 11.4% over the year ended December 29, 2001 sales of $1.14 billion. The increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of 4.8% and the inclusion of 31 stores opened during 2001 for the entire 2002 period and 28 net new stores opened in 2002. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to improved pharmacy sales, which increased to 41.8% of total sales in 2002 compared to 39.2% of total sales in 2001. Pharmacy sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth rates versus front-end sales. Pharmacy comparable store sales increased by 12.1%, while front-end comparable store sales were flat.            Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 77.5% for 2002 from 76.2% for 2001, resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to 22.5% for 2002 from 23.8% for 2001. The gross margin decline primarily resulted from the absence of comparable store growth in the higher margin front-end sales and the faster growth rate of lower margin pharmacy sales. The absence of growth in comparable front-end sales for the year was primarily attributable to the recessionary economy which pervaded the metro New York market throughout 2002. Gross profit was also adversely impacted by higher shrink related losses. In addition, for 2002 and 2001, cost of sales includes other related real estate income and income from the sale of market related data totaling $5.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively.            Selling, general and administrative expenses were $198.5 million, or 15.6% of net sales, and $173.0 million, or 15.1% of net sales, in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase as a percentage of sales reflects a lower rate of same store sales growth in fiscal 2002 than in 2001, increased labor costs and operating leases associated with the startup of 65 incremental one hour photo processing    19          departments, higher costs of property insurance in the aftermath of the September 11 disaster and increased legal and litigation-related expenses.            Depreciation and amortization of intangibles in 2002 and 2001 was $26.9 million and $26.6 million, respectively. The increase was attributable to capital spending for property and equipment additions during 2001 and 2002, primarily in support of new store growth as well as amortization expenses for pharmacy customer lists and lease acquisition costs for acquisitions completed during 2001 and 2002. Fiscal 2002 also reflects a benefit of approximately $4.3 million due to the elimination of goodwill amortization, attributable to our adoption of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142.            Store pre-opening expenses of $2.1 million related to the opening of 32 stores in 2002 as compared to $1.7 million reflecting 31 store openings in 2001.            Net interest expense decreased to $17.9 million in 2002 from $27.6 million in 2001. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to the $210.5 million of proceeds from the April 2002 Convertible Note Offering that were used to reduce higher cost term loan, revolver and 9 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Note borrowings. In addition, we realized lower interest rates on the floating rate portion of our revolving credit facility during 2002.            Our pre-tax income increased 15.8% to $50.3 million in 2002 from $43.5 million in 2001.            During 2002, we recorded an income tax provision of $18.9 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 40.9%, reduced by certain wage-related income tax credits amounting to $1.7 million. During 2001, we recorded an income tax provision of $17.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 43.0%, reduced by wage-related income tax credits totaling $1.4 million.            During 2002, we recorded total net extraordinary charges of $6.6 million, net of an income tax benefit of $4.7 million, which were composed of the following: (1) $1.8 million, reflecting the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs related to (a) loans under our Senior Credit Agreement that were repaid with the proceeds of our offering of senior convertible notes, (b) our 9 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes that were purchased pursuant to a tender offer completed in June 2002, and (c) the December 2002 repurchase of a portion of our senior convertible notes, (2) $4.1 million associated with the payment of consent premiums and other expenses related to the tender offer, (3) $2.3 million related to the termination of the interest rate swap agreement tied to interest expenses on the loans under the Senior Credit Agreement that were retired with proceeds from the convertible notes offering, and (4) an extraordinary gain of $1.6 million related to the December 2002 repurchase of $17.5 million of our outstanding senior convertible notes.            During 2002, as a result of the change in accounting method for inventory valuation from retail dollar FIFO to specific cost LIFO, we recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $9.3 million, net of an income tax benefit of $6.7 million.             Net income was $15.6 million in 2002 and $24.7 million in 2001. The decrease was due to the factors previously described.    Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000             Net sales in the 52-week year ended December 29, 2001 were $1.14 billion, an increase of 14.3% over the 53-week year ended December 30, 2000 sales of $1.00 billion. On a comparable 52-week basis, net sales in 2001 increased 16.3% over the same period in 2000. The increases were due to increased comparable store sales of 6.3% and the inclusion of 24 stores opened during 2000 for the entire 2001 period and 28 net new stores opened in 2001. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to improved pharmacy sales, which increased to 39.2% of total sales in 2001 compared to 35.4% of total sales in 2000. Pharmacy sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth rates versus front-end sales. Pharmacy and front-end comparable sales increased by 16.6% and 0.6%, respectively.    20                 Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 76.2% for 2001 from 74.6% for 2000, resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to 23.8% for 2001 from 25.4% for 2000. Cost of goods sold in 2001 includes two unusual items, a loss of $2.6 million from the early termination of a supply agreement and a gain of $1.4 million from the sale of a few stores' customer lists. The combined net loss of $1.2 million for these unusual items represented 0.1% of sales in 2001. The balance of the gross margin decline primarily resulted from the low front-end comparable store growth rate of 0.6% and the faster growth rate of lower margin pharmacy sales. The low growth rate in comparable front-end sales for the year was primarily attributable to the impact of customer disruptions in the aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster, the recessionary economy in the second half of the year and a mild flu season in the fourth quarter that depressed sales of cough and cold categories. Lower margin pharmacy sales benefited in the fourth quarter from increased demand for ciprofloxacin as a result of anthrax scares, as well as higher rates of sales in certain sleep aids and anti-depressants. Gross profit was also adversely impacted by the loss of front-end sales related allowances in the period following the World Trade Center disaster.            Selling, general and administrative expenses were $173.0 million, or 15.1% of net sales, and $155.6 million, or 15.6% of net sales, in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of sales reflects improved efficiencies and additional expense leveraging against new store sales, as well as a reduction in earnings-based incentive compensation and benefit costs.            Depreciation and amortization of intangibles in 2001 and 2000 was $26.6 million and $23.2 million, respectively. The increase was attributable to capital spending for property and equipment additions during 2000 and 2001, primarily in support of new store growth as well as amortization expenses for goodwill, pharmacy customer lists and lease acquisition costs for acquisitions completed during 2000 and 2001.            Store pre-opening expenses of $1.7 million related to the opening of 31 stores in 2001 as compared to $1.4 million reflecting 24 store openings in 2000.            Net interest expense decreased to $27.6 million in 2001 from $35.9 million in 2000. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to the $130.4 million of proceeds from the June, 2001 Equity Offering that were used to reduce term loan and revolver borrowings and lower interest rates on the floating rate portion of our revolving credit facility during 2001, as well as one less week in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. This was partially offset by increased revolver borrowings attributable to the lost sales and earnings in the aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster.            Our pre-tax income increased 13.5% to $43.5 million in 2001 from $38.3 million in 2000.            During 2001, we recorded an income tax provision of $17.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 43.0%, reduced by certain wage-related income tax credits amounting to $1.4 million. During 2000, we recorded an income tax provision of $15.6 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 42.9%, reduced by wage-related income tax credits totaling $0.8 million.            Net income was $24.7 million in 2001 and $22.7 million in 2000. The increase of $2.0 million is a result of the increase in pre-tax income of $5.2 million in 2001 versus 2000, partially offset by the incremental income tax provision of $1.6 million and the after-tax extraordinary charge of $1.5 million in 2001, reflecting the write-off of deferred financing costs as a result of the June 2001 early retirement of debt.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             On April 16, 2002, we completed an offering (the "2002 Offering") of $381.5 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes maturing on April 16, 2022 (the "Convertible Notes"). After deducting commissions and expenses related to the offering, we realized net proceeds of $210.5 million. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay an aggregate of approximately $86.1 million in principal amount of Term A loans and Term B loans and $41.5 million in principal    21          amount of revolving loans (which revolving loans may be reborrowed) under our Senior Credit Agreement. In addition, we terminated an interest rate swap agreement, which was set to expire in January 2003, at a cost of approximately $3.9 million.            The Convertible Notes were issued at a discount and pay cash interest at the rate of 2.1478% per year on the principal amount at maturity, until April 16, 2007. After that date, interest will accrue on the notes as amortization of the original issue discount representing a yield to maturity of 3.75% per year, computed on a semi-annual bond equivalent basis. Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert each $1,000 in principal amount of their Convertible Notes into 14.1265 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment, only if (1) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (2) the notes are called for redemption, or (3) specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we have the right to deliver, in lieu of our common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock in an amount as described in the indenture. It is our intention to redeem these notes by delivering cash. Holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on April 16, 2007 at a price of $572.76 per note plus accrued cash interest, if any; on April 16, 2012 at a price of $689.68 per note plus accrued cash interest, if any; and on April 16, 2017 at a price of $830.47 per note plus accrued cash interest, if any. We may choose to pay the purchase price of such notes in cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. In addition, if we experience a change in control, each holder may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder's notes at a price equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, to the date of purchase. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Convertible Notes at any time after April 16, 2007, at a price equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, to the redemption date.            On June 3, 2002, we completed a tender offer and consent solicitation (the "Tender Offer") to purchase our outstanding 9 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "Senior Notes"). On June 3, 2002, we expended a total of $87.1 million from the balance of the proceeds of the 2002 Offering to pay our obligations under the Tender Offer. This payment was composed of principal value ($78.4 million), premium payments ($6.5 million) and accrued interest earned from February 16, 2002 through the payment date ($2.2 million). During the fourth quarter of 2002, we repurchased and retired $17.5 million of the Convertible Notes at a cost of $14.9 million, resulting in an extraordinary gain, prior to the effect of income taxes, of $2.6 million.            At December 28, 2002, we had $4.8 million in Term A and $60.3 million in Term B loans outstanding under our Senior Credit Agreement, $201.0 million of outstanding Convertible Notes and $1.6 million of outstanding Senior Notes. We had no outstanding borrowings under our $80.0 million revolving credit facility (other than $0.8 million of outstanding standby letters of credit) and $4.2 million in cash. On February 18, 2003 we retired the remaining $1.6 million of Senior Notes. Any amounts outstanding under our revolving loans and Term A loans mature on February 15, 2004 and the Term B loans mature on February 15, 2007. Our outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement are principally LIBOR based borrowings with margins of 1.75% on revolver and Term A loans and a margin of 2.50% on Term B loans. We are currently evaluating proposals for refinancing our Senior Credit Agreement and expect to replace the Agreement with a longer term maturity financing during the current year. We expect that the interest rates we obtain upon the refinancing of these loans will be approximately equivalent to the rates currently in effect.            The Senior Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit or restrict, among other things, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to make capital expenditures, incur indebtedness, permit liens on our property, enter into transactions with affiliates, make restricted payments, investments or acquisitions, enter into mergers, consolidations or dissolutions, conduct asset sales, pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and business activities. Financial performance covenants included in our Senior Credit Agreement include interest coverage, leverage ratios, minimum net worth requirements and fixed charge coverage requirements. At December 28, 2002, we were in    22           compliance with all financial performance covenants in our Senior Credit Agreement. There are no credit ratings related triggers in our Senior Credit Agreement or in the indenture related to our Convertible Notes that would impact cost of borrowing, annual amortization of principal or related debt maturities.            Working capital was $230.9 million as of December 28, 2002 and $214.1 million as of December 29, 2001. The increase of $16.8 million was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $4.9 million combined with a decrease of $7.1 million in accrued interest and the current portion of long-term debt. The increase in accounts receivable primarily reflects the growth of the third-party pharmacy business. The change in accrued interest and the current portion of long-term debt is reflective of the restructuring of our debt, including the liquidation of our Senior Notes and the accelerated repayment of a portion of our outstanding term loans.            For fiscal 2002, net cash provided by operating activities was $42.5 million, compared to $25.8 million for fiscal 2001. The primary reason for the increase was the lower rate of growth in working capital in 2002 over 2001 than experienced in 2001 over 2000.            For fiscal 2002, net cash used in investing activities was $60.5 million, compared to $48.1 million in fiscal 2001. Net cash used in investing activities in 2002 was for capital expenditures of $47.6 million, primarily related to the opening and remodeling of new and renovated stores, combined with $12.9 million for lease, pharmacy file and other acquisition costs. Net cash used in investing activities in 2001 was due to capital expenditures of $41.0 million and $8.5 million for lease, pharmacy file and other acquisition costs, partially offset by $1.4 million of proceeds generated by the sale of certain stores' pharmacy customer files.            For fiscal 2002, net cash provided by financing activities was $17.2 million, compared to $26.3 million in fiscal 2001. The lower levels of cash provided by financing activities in 2002 resulted from the improved level of cash flow from operating activities partially offset by increased capital expenditures to support increased levels of new store growth and higher levels of cash spending for lease, pharmacy file and other acquisition costs. Proceeds of $210.5 million from the 2002 Offering were used to repay a portion of our outstanding senior debt.            Our capital requirements primarily result from opening and stocking new stores, remodeling and renovating existing retail locations and from the continuing development of management information systems. We believe that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores, and currently plan to open approximately 35 to 45 stores during the next two years. We expect to spend approximately $40.0 million in fiscal 2003 on capital expenditures, primarily for new and replacement stores and an additional $13.0 million for lease and pharmacy file acquisitions and other costs. We also require working capital to support inventory for our existing stores. Historically, we have been able to lease our store locations.            Leases for 13 of our stores that generated approximately 4.2% of our net sales for fiscal 2002 are scheduled to expire before the end of fiscal 2004. Four of these leases have renewal options. We believe that we will be able to renew the other expiring leases on economically favorable terms or, alternatively, find other economically attractive locations to lease.            As of December 28, 2002, approximately 4,600 of our approximately 6,000 employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreements covering these employees, we are required, in some instances, to pay specified annual increases in salary and benefits contributions relating to the member employees. We do not believe that these increases will have a material impact on our liquidity or results of operations.            Under an employment agreement with our Chairman and CEO negotiated during fiscal 2002, we are required to fund premiums for a split dollar life insurance policy that will provide certain post-retirement benefits. During fiscal 2002 these premiums amounted to $4.0 million and are    23          scheduled to increase to $5.0 million per year in fiscal 2003 through 2010. The premiums have been established at a level anticipated to be sufficient to cover the full amount of the projected retirement benefits as well as to return the full cost of the premiums, plus a 3% rate of interest. Recent Sarbanes-Oxley legislation has resulted in the need for additional guidance concerning the permissibility of split dollar life insurance policies for executives. While we believe this split dollar policy is permitted under current interpretations of the legislation, there can be no assurance that future interpretations or guidance to be provided by the SEC concerning this legislation will concur.             We believe that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including revolving loan borrowings subject to an extension, refinancing or replacement of our Senior Credit Agreement, will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, to fund anticipated capital expenditures and to satisfy our working capital requirements. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that our operating results, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. Substantially all of our borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates. Therefore, our financial condition will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates.            The following table provides additional information with respect to our Commitments and Obligations:       Payments due by Period   (dollars in thousands)      Contractual Cash Obligations       Total     Within  1 year     2-3 years     4-5 years     After  5 years    Long-Term Debt (1)     $  267,744     $  3,962     $  2,688     $  58,441     $  202,653    Capital Lease Obligations (2)        1,997        472        884        641            Operating Leases (3)        1,099,797        99,590        194,679        182,601        622,927    CEO Split Dollar Life Insurance Policy (4)        40,000        5,000        10,000        10,000        15,000                             Total Contractual Cash Obligations     $  1,409,538     $  109,024     $  208,251     $  251,683     $  840,580                                 (1) At December 28, 2002, this represented the outstanding balance of term loans ($65.1 million) under our Senior Credit Agreement, combined with the outstanding balance of our 2.1478% Senior Convertible Notes due 2022 ($201.0 million) and our 9.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 ($1.6 million), as further detailed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period   (dollars in thousands)      Other Commercial Commitments       Total  Amounts  Committed     Within  1 year     2-3 years     4-5 years     After  5 years    Standby Letters of Credit (1)     $  771     $  771                                            Total Commercial Commitments     $  771     $  771                                                (1) Standby Letters of Credit, primarily representing property lease security deposits, are renewed on an annual basis.            We are party to multi-year, merchandise supply agreements in the normal course of business. The largest of these is with AmerisourceBergen, our primary pharmaceutical supplier. Generally, these agreements provide for certain volume commitments and are terminable by us, subject in some cases to specified termination payments, none of which would constitute a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. It is the opinion of management that if any of these agreements were terminated or if any contracting party was to experience events precluding fulfillment of its obligations, we would be able to find a suitable alternative supplier.            We are not a party to any agreements with, or commitments to, any special purpose entities that would constitute material off balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments listed above.    Critical Accounting Policies             Our discussion of results of operations and financial condition relies on our consolidated financial statements that are prepared based on certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgments and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. We believe that investors need to be aware of these policies and how they impact our financial reporting to gain a more complete understanding of our consolidated financial statements as a whole, as well as our related discussion and analysis presented herein. While we believe that these accounting policies are grounded on sound measurement criteria, actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates or forecasts. The accounting policies and related risks described in the paragraphs below are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and estimates.             SIZE=2> Pharmacy ReceivablesReserves for Uncollectible Accounts At December 28, 2002, accounts receivable included $33.5 million of amounts due from various insurance companies and governmental agencies under third party payment plans for prescription sales made prior to the year-end date. Our accounting policy is to fully reserve for all unpaid pharmacy receivables over 120 days old, as well as any others deemed potentially uncollectible. This policy is based on our past collection experience. Our uncollectible pharmacy receivable losses amounted to $1.2 million in fiscal 2002 and there was approximately $3.8 million reserved for uncollectible pharmacy receivables at December 28, 2002.             SIZE=2> Inventory Shrink Estimates We take complete physical inventories in all of our stores at least once per year and front-end physical inventories in most stores twice per year on a staggered cycle basis. We take physical inventories at our distribution centers twice per year. Front-end inventories at balance sheet dates are valued using the specific-cost, item-based last in, first out (LIFO) method reduced by estimated inventory shrink losses for the period between the last physical inventory in each store and the balance sheet date. These shrink estimates are based on the latest chain-wide trends. At December 28, 2002, a change in this shrink estimate of 1.0% of front-end sales would impact current year pre-tax earnings by approximately $2.8 million.    25                  SIZE=2> Insurance Liabilities and Reserves At December 28, 2002, there were $2.5 million of accrued general liability claim costs that primarily related to our self-insured portion of customer accident claims. Our policy is to recognize a liability for the estimated self-insured portion of the projected ultimate settlement value of these claims as well as a provision for incurred but unreported claims as of each balance sheet date. These estimates are made based on a review of the facts and circumstances of each individual claim using experienced third party claims adjustors. These estimates are also reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis by management. For the vast majority of claims, the maximum self-insured portion of any individual claim amounts to $100,000, however, our historical claim settlement experience is significantly lower. At December 28, 2002, there were 259 outstanding claims with an average projected settlement value of approximately $9,600, as compared to 172 outstanding claims with an average projected settlement value of $13,000 at December 29, 2001.             SIZE=2> Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 28, 2002, goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, amounted to approximately $160.4 million. Other net intangible assets consisted of lease acquisition costs of $35.5 million, customer lists of $21.1 million and non-compete agreements amounting to $1.5 million. Our policy is to evaluate our intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill, for impairment as of each balance sheet date by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows from the underlying stores or assets over their remaining asset lives to the net intangible asset values. Any intangible asset for which the projected undiscounted cash flow is insufficient to recover the asset's carrying value is considered impaired and would be written down to its net recoverable value. Such write-downs would result in a non-cash charge to earnings. Based upon our anticipated future revenues and cash flows and the net intangible balances existing at December 28, 2002, all stores are projected to recover their intangible asset values within their useful lives. Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No 142. We utilize the market capitalization of our common stock in performing the required impairment test. Our most recent evaluation did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. However, we may be required to perform an interim impairment review if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition or the loss of key personnel. We may be required to recognize an impairment charge at the time an interim or future annual impairment review is performed, depending in part on the value of our market capitalization.             SIZE=2> Other Loss Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies often take years to resolve and can involve complicated litigation matters and potential regulatory actions, the outcomes of which are difficult to predict. At December 28, 2002, we have recorded one loss contingency, representing our estimated portion of a potential settlement of an ongoing lawsuit between various retailers and a delivery drivers union.             SIZE=2> Income Taxes Our effective tax rate, which was 37.5% for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2002, has been and is expected to continue to be a major factor in the determination of our profitability and cash flow. As such, a significant shift in the relative sources of our earnings, or changes in tax rules or interpretations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.    Change in Accounting Method             During the first quarter of 2002, we adopted a change in accounting method to convert from the retail dollar based first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method of inventory valuation to an item specific cost based last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method of inventory valuation. This change resulted in a one-time non-cash after tax charge of approximately $9.3 million, which was recorded in the first quarter as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Adoption of the specific cost LIFO method has resulted in    26          the recognition of the latest item costs in our reported gross margins, and has made our results more comparable to other major retailers in our industry.    Seasonality             The non-pharmacy business is seasonal in nature, with the Christmas holiday season generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other periods. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our quarterly results and an indication of our results of operations.    Inflation             We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations during the three years ended December 28, 2002.    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements             During the third quarter of 2001, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Pronouncements Nos. 141 (FAS 141) and 142 (FAS 142) "Business Combinations" and "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", respectively, for acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001 (See Note 5 "Acquisitions"). These adoptions did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. During the first quarter ended March 30, 2002, we adopted these same standards for goodwill related to acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001. For the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2002, our goodwill amortization expense was reduced by $4.3 million as a result of the adoption of these standards. Had these standards been adopted prior to the 2001 fiscal year, our net income for the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2001 would have been approximately $27.3 million. In addition, for the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2001, our net income per basic share outstanding and net income per diluted share outstanding would have been $1.30 and $1.25, respectively. At December 28, 2002, included within the "other assets" category on our balance sheet, were intangible assets totaling $71.5 million, net of accumulated amortization of $55.0 million. The $71.5 million is primarily composed of costs related to the acquisition of store leases ($35.5 million) and pharmacy customer files ($21.1 million), deferred financing costs ($7.3 million) and all other net intangible assets ($7.6 million). Lease acquisition costs are generally amortized over the remaining lease life, pharmacy file acquisition costs are amortized over seven years, and deferred financing costs are amortized over the life of the financing agreement.            During the first quarter of 2002, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Pronouncement No. 144 (FAS 144), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." FAS 144 supersedes FAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of." The provisions of FAS 144 are effective for financial statements issued after December 15, 2001. This adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows (See Critical Accounting Policies above).            In April 2002, FAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was issued. Under FAS No. 145, gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt should no longer be segregated on the income statement as extraordinary items. Instead, such gains and losses should be included as a component of income from continuing operations. The provisions of FAS No. 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002 with early adoption encouraged. Upon adoption, we will reclassify from extraordinary charges to other income / (loss), for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, pre-tax amounts of $11.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively. The income tax provisions for the 2002 and 2001 fiscal years will be adjusted commensurately. Reported net income will remain unaffected by the reclassification.            In July 2002, FAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," was issued. This statement nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, "Liability    27          Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." FAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. The provisions of FAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, with early adoption encouraged.            In September 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force released Issue No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor". The pronouncement addresses two issues. The first issue requires that vendor allowances be categorized as a reduction of cost of sales unless they are a reimbursement of costs incurred to sell the vendor's products, in which case, the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost. Cash consideration received from a vendor in excess of the fair value of the benefit received should be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales. As required, we will adopt this portion of the pronouncement in 2003. The second issue requires that rebates or refunds payable only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases should be recognized as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation over the purchase period. This portion of the pronouncement is to be applied to all new arrangements initiated after November 21, 2002. We do not expect that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.            In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN No. 45 clarifies the requirements of FAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," relating to a guarantor's accounting for and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. FIN No. 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor's obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The recognition provisions of FIN No. 45 became effective for us beginning on January 1, 2003. We do not believe that this interpretation will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.            In December 2002, SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure" was issued. This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. As required, we adopted SFAS No. 148 effective in 2002. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.             In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FIN No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of FIN No. 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. We do not believe that the adoption of these provisions will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    28         ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MARKET RISK             Our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates. Variable rate debt outstanding under our Senior Credit Agreement was approximately $65.1 million at December 28, 2002. At December 28, 2002, the weighted average combined interest rate in effect on all borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement was 4.32%. A 0.50% change in interest rates applied to the $65.1 million balance of floating rate debt existing at December 28, 2002 would affect pre-tax annual results of operations by approximately $0.3 million. In addition, we also have $201.0 million of Convertible Notes and $1.6 million of Senior Notes outstanding at December 28, 2002. These notes bear interest payable semi-annually at fixed rates of 3.75% and 9.25%, respectively, and are therefore not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations. The $1.6 million of Senior Notes were retired on February 18, 2003.             The principal objective of our investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to facilitate our funding needs. As part of our risk management, we may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps in the future.    29       NAME="page_fb3347_1_30">        ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
