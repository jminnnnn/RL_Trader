ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS      The following should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.  GENERAL      The Company generates revenues primarily through sales of OTC drugs and prescription pharmaceutical products, health and beauty care products, food and beverage items, tobacco products, cosmetics, housewares, hosiery, greeting cards, photofinishing, photo supplies and seasonal merchandise. Health and beauty care products, including OTC drugs, represent the largest of the Company's product categories. The Company's primary costs and expenses consist of (i) inventory costs, (ii) labor expenses and (iii) occupancy costs.      The Company had sales per square foot of $968 and $1,040 in fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998, respectively. The Company believes that sales per square foot is a useful measure of comparing the Company's performance to that of its competitors because it is a measure of a store's sales productivity. The Company currently expects that its sales per square foot may decline as it continues with its plan to increase new store openings during fiscal 2000. The opening of such additional stores may result in a decline in sales per square foot principally because (i) the average square footage for new stores will often be greater than that of the existing store base and (ii) new stores generally take some time to reach a mature level of sales. The Company believes that its competitors in the industry experience increases and decreases in sales per square foot for similar reasons. Over the next two years, the Company plans to open approximately 30 to 40 stores, primarily in New York City.      The Company includes stores that have been in operation for at least 13 months for purposes of calculating comparable store sales figures.      In June 1997, the DLJ Entities and certain of its affiliates acquired approximately 91.5% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company from Bain Capital and certain other selling securityholders (the "Recapitalization"). Upon consummation of such purchase, the Company reclassified all of its outstanding capital stock (then consisting of four classes) into one class of common stock, $0.01 par value per share. In February 1998, the Company successfully completed an initial public offering (the "Offering") of its common stock.      The Company's primary assets are its ownership of 99% of the outstanding partnership interest of Duane Reade, a New York general partnership ("Duane Reade") and ownership of all of the outstanding common stock of DRI I Inc. ("DRI"). DRI owns the remaining 1% partnership interest in Duane Reade. Substantially all of the operations of the Company are conducted through Duane Reade. In August 1999, the Company established two new subsidiaries, Duane Reade International ("International") and Duane Reade Realty ("Realty"). Duane Reade distributed to the Company and DRI all rights, title, and interest in all its trademarks, trade names and all other intellectual properties ("IP"). In turn the Company and DRI made a capital contribution of the IP to International. This change was to create a controlled system to manage and exploit the IP and various leases separate and apart from the retail operations. In addition, Duane Reade distributed some of its store leases to the Company and DRI, which in turn made a capital contribution of these leases to Realty. In addition, Realty is the lessee under certain store leases entered into after its creation. Realty subleases to Duane Reade the properties subject to those leases.                                         13  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following sets forth the results of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated.                                                             1999          1998          1997                                                        --------      --------      --------        Net Sales............................................   100.0%        100.0%        100.0% Cost of Sales........................................    74.0          73.4          75.0                                                         -----         -----         ----- Gross profit.........................................    26.0          26.6          25.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses.........    16.1          16.1          15.2 Amortization.........................................     1.3           1.2           1.2 Depreciation.........................................     1.3           1.2           0.8 Store pre-opening expenses...........................     0.2           0.5           0.2 Nonrecurring charges.................................      --            --           3.0                                                         -----         -----         ----- Operating income.....................................     7.1           7.6           4.6 Net interest expense.................................     3.5           4.4           8.0                                                         -----         -----         ----- Income (loss) before income taxes....................     3.6           3.2          (3.4) Income tax benefit...................................     1.2            --            --                                                         -----         -----         ----- Income (loss) before extraordinary charge............     4.8           3.2          (3.4) Extraordinary charge.................................      --          (4.0)           --                                                         -----         -----         ----- Net income (loss)....................................    4.8%          (0.8)%        (3.4)%                                                         =====         =====         =====   FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1998      Net sales in 1999 were $839.8 million, an increase of 43.0% over 1998 net sales of $587.4 million. The increase was due to increased comparable store sales of 8.9% and the inclusion of 33 stores opened during 1998 for the entire 1999 period and 21 new stores opened in 1999. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to increased pharmacy sales, which increased to 31.9% of total sales in 1999 compared to 28.3% of total sales in 1998. Pharmacy sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth rates versus front end sales.      Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 74.0% for 1999 from 73.4% for 1998, resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to 26.0% for 1999 from 26.6% for 1998. The decrease in gross margin resulted principally from pharmacy sales making up a greater percentage of total sales and the impact of lower gross margins in the Rock Bottom stores acquired in September 1998.      Selling, general and administrative expenses were $135.8 million or 16.1% of net sales and $94.6 million or 16.1% of net sales in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The large number of new and immature stores, along with the increased proportion of higher cost pharmacy business, has offset the favorable leveraging of expenses associated with the Company's sales growth.      Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 1999 and 1998 was $10.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The increase in amortization resulted principally from the amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangibles related to the Rock Bottom stores acquisition in September of 1998 as well as the acquisition of a portion of the Loves Stores chain in May of 1999 and increases in the amortization of customer lists and lease acquisition costs for pharmacy acquisitions during 1999.      The increase in depreciation from $7.0 million in 1998 to $10.9 million in 1999 resulted principally from depreciation on the 21 stores opened during 1999, a full year of depreciation expense in 1999 on the 33 stores opened during 1998 and 29 Rock Bottom stores acquired in September of 1998 compared to a partial year of depreciation expense in 1998.                                         14      Store pre-opening expenses decreased from $3.3 million in 1998 to $1.5 million in 1999 due to the opening of 21 new stores in 1999 compared to 33 in 1998.      Net interest expense increased to $29.3 million in 1999 from $25.6 million in 1998. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher levels of average borrowing and higher interest rates during 1999.      The Company's income before income taxes increased 60.9% to $30.2 million in 1999 from $18.8 million in 1998.      During 1999, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $10.5 million due to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation reserves which were partially offset by the income tax provision for the current year's income. The Company was not required to record an income tax provision in 1998 as it had no taxable income and its net operating loss carry forwards and related deferred tax asset had a valuation reserve of 100%.      During 1998 the Company recorded a $23.6 million extraordinary charge related to the early extinguishment of debt.      The Company recorded net income of $40.7 million in 1999 versus a net loss of $4.8 million in 1998. The increase of $45.5 million is a result of higher gross profit as a result of higher sales, the extraordinary charge recorded in 1998, and the income tax benefit recorded in 1999, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization and depreciation expense.  FISCAL 1998 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1997      Net sales in 1998 were $587.4 million, an increase of 36.7% over 1997 net sales of $429.8 million. The increase was due to increased comparable store sales of 6.5% and the inclusion of seven stores opened during 1997 for the entire 1998 period, 33 new stores opened in 1998, and 28 stores purchased in the Rock Bottom Acquisition. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to increased pharmacy sales, which increased to 28.3% of total sales in 1998 compared to 25.1% of total sales in 1997.      Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 73.4% for 1998 from 75.0% for 1997, resulting in an increase in gross profit margin to 26.6% for 1998 from 25.0% for 1997. The increase in gross margin resulted principally from contribution from higher margin merchandise such as greeting cards, photo finishing, cosmetics, vitamins, generic drugs and private label products.      Selling, general and administrative expenses were $94.6 million or 16.1% of net sales and $65.4 million or 15.2% of net sales in 1998 and 1997, respectively. The percentage increase in 1998 compared to 1997 resulted principally from higher selling expenses related to higher store salaries as a percentage of net sales and increases in other store-related expenses (principally attributable to new stores during the early months of operation) as well as approximately $1.4 million of nonrecurring transition costs related to the integration of the Rock Bottom stores during the fourth quarter of 1998. Transition costs related to the Rock Botton Acquisition include redundant costs incurred related to the occupancy costs of an additional warehouse, the costs related to maintaining duplicate warehouse and point of sale systems, administrative payroll costs for positions during the integration period and expenses incurred to convert the stores to the Duane Reade format.      Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 1998 and 1997 was $7.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The increase in amortization resulted principally from the amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangibles related to the Rock Bottom stores as well as increases in the amortization of customer lists and lease acquisition costs for pharmacy acquisitions during 1998.      The increase in depreciation from $3.5 million in 1997 to $7.0 million in 1998 resulted principally from depreciation on the 33 stores opened during 1998, a full year of depreciation expense in 1998 on the seven                                         15  stores opened during 1997 compared to a partial year of depreciation expense in 1997 and depreciation expense on the 28 Rock Bottom stores.      Store pre-opening expenses increased from $767,000 in 1997 to $3.3 million in 1998 due to the opening of 33 new stores in 1998 compared to seven in 1997.      Net interest expense decreased 25.7% to $25.6 million in 1998 from $34.5 million in 1997. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to the impact of the debt refinancing completed during February 1998 in connection with the Refinancing Plan (as defined) which resulted in lower overall debt levels and a reduction of interest rates.      The Company's income before extraordinary charge increased by $33.5 million to $18.8 million for 1998 from a net loss of $14.7 million for 1997 as a result of the $12.7 million nonrecurring charges in the prior year period; decreased interest expense; and increased sales and gross profit margin, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses; store pre-opening expenses; depreciation and amortization. Including the extraordinary charge related to the early extinguishment of debt, the net loss for 1998 was $4.8 million.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      In February 1998, the Company successfully completed the Offering, which was part of a plan to refinance all of the Company's then existing indebtedness (the "Refinancing Plan") in order to enhance the Company's financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and implement capital improvements. The Refinancing Plan resulted in a reduction in the Company's overall indebtedness, a simplification of the Company's capital structure and access to additional borrowings. The principal components of the Refinancing Plan were: (i) the sale by the Company of 6.7 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $102 million; (ii) the execution of a new secured credit agreement (the "Existing Credit Agreement"), which provided for borrowings up to approximately $160 million ($130 million of term loans and up to $30 million of revolving loans); (iii) the issuance of $80 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "Senior Notes") for net proceeds of approximately $77 million; (iv) the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the Company's former credit agreement (the "Former Credit Agreement"), the outstanding principal amount of which was $89.8 million as of December 27, 1997; (v) the redemption of the Company's outstanding 15% Zero Coupon Senior Subordinated Notes due 2004 (the "Zero Coupon Notes"); and (vi) the redemption of the Company's outstanding 12% Senior Notes due 2002 (the "12% Senior Notes").      On August 14, 1998, in connection with the Rock Bottom Acquisition, the Existing Credit Agreement was amended to allow for increased term loan borrowings of $10 million. On September 11, 1998, also in connection with the Rock Bottom Acquisition, the Existing Credit Agreement was amended and restated to increase available term loan borrowings by $70 million, bringing the total permitted borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement to $240 million ($210 million of term loans and up to $30 million of revolving loans).      On March 17, 1999, in connection with additional planned pharmacy acquisitions and capital spending requirements, the Existing Credit Agreement was amended and restated again to increase available borrowings by $35 million to $275 million ($235 million of term loans and $40 million of revolving loans). On December 16, 1999 the Existing Credit Agreement was amended to increase permitted revolving loan borrowings to $60 million of which $40 million was actually made available to the Company at December 25, 1999.      On January 7, 2000 and February 11, 2000 available revolver borrowings were increased by $6.0 million and $4.0 million respectively, bringing total available revolver borrowings to $50 million.      On March 17, 2000, in order to provide additional availability of capital to the Company for general working capital needs, the Existing Credit Agreement was amended and restated to permit available term                                         16  loan borrowings to increase by up to $30 million of which $10 million was actually made available to the Company. In addition, available revolver borrowings were increased by $5.0 million, bringing total available borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement to $300 million ($245 million of term loans and $55 million of revolver loans). The additional $10 million proceeds of the term loans were used to reduce revolver borrowings.      Working capital was $120.0 million and $90.0 million as of December 25, 1999 and December 26, 1998, respectively. The increase is primarily due to increases in inventory related to the opening of 21 additional stores during 1999, the reversal of the valuation reserve on the current portion of the deferred tax asset and increases in accounts receivable due to additional volume.      The Company's EBITDA increased by $23.7 million or 38.3% to $85.8 million in 1999 compared to 1998. EBITDA as a percentage of sales was 10.2% in 1999 as compared to 10.6% in 1998.      For fiscal 1999, net cash provided by operating activities was $16.9 million, compared to $5.5 million for fiscal 1998. The primary reason for the increase in net cash provided was increased cash earnings partially offset by increases in working capital and decreases in other liabilities associated with new store additions and the timing of disbursements.      For fiscal 1999, net cash used in investing activities was $45.3 million, compared to $111.6 million for fiscal 1998. Net cash used in investing activities in 1999 was due to capital expenditures of $37.2 million primarily related to the opening and remodeling of new and renovated stores and capital expenditures related to the conversion of Rock Bottom stores to the Duane Reade format, $8.5 million for lease acquisition and pharmacy file acquisition costs, $10.3 million to purchase six Love's stores and a Pasteur Pharmacy offset by proceeds of $10.7 million from the sale of assets. Net cash used in investing activities in 1998 was due to the Rock Bottom acquisition and capital expenditures related to the opening of new stores, store remodeling, lease and pharmacy file acquisition costs.      For fiscal 1999, net cash provided by financing activities was $28.6 million, compared to $106.6 million for fiscal 1998. The net cash provided in 1999 was primarily due to additional borrowings under credit facilities. The net cash provided in 1998 was primarily from the proceeds of the public offering and additional bank borrowings.      The Company's capital requirements primarily result from opening and stocking new stores and from the continuing development of management information systems. The Company believes that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores, and currently plans to open approximately 30 to 40 stores during the next two years. The Company expects to spend approximately $25 million in fiscal 2000 on capital expenditures primarily for new and replacement stores and an additional $5 million for lease and pharmacy file acquisition costs.. Working capital is also required to support inventory for the Company's existing stores. Historically, the Company has been able to lease its store locations.      Leases for seven of the Company's stores that generated approximately 3.9% of the Company's net sales for fiscal 1999 are scheduled to expire before the end of fiscal 2001. The Company believes that it will be able to renew such leases on economically favorable terms or, alternatively, find other economically attractive locations to lease.      As of December 25, 1999, approximately 3,500 of the Company's approximately 5,000 employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Pursuant to the terms of such collective bargaining agreements, the Company is required to pay certain annual increases in salary and benefits to such employees. The Company does not believe that such increases will have a material impact on the Company's liquidity or results of operations.      The Company believes that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including additional borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement, will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of                                         17  principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the terms of its debt agreements. As of December 25, 1999, the Company had borrowed approximately $28.5 million under the revolving portion of its bank credit facility and had approximately $11.1 million of remaining availability. The ability of the Company to meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent upon the future performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's operating results, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of its indebtedness in the future. Substantially all of the Company's borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates; therefore, the Company's financial condition will be affected by the changes in prevailing interest rates. The Company has entered into an interest rate protection agreement for $65.0 million of its floating rate debt that caps LIBOR rates at 6.5%. Theis agreement expires in November 2000 (See note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements).  TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES      At December 25, 1999, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") of approximately $68 million, which are due to expire in the years 2007 through 2018. These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through 2018 and thereby reduce or eliminate the Company's federal income taxes otherwise payable. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), imposes significant limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the event of an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Code (the "Section 382 Limitation"). The Section 382 Limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs that a corporation may use to offset its post-ownership change income. The Section 382 Limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporation's stock immediately before an ownership change by the long-term tax-exempt rate (as published by the Internal Revenue Service). Generally, an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership (by value) of that corporation by one or more 5% shareholders (including certain groups of shareholders who in the aggregate own at least 5% of that corporation's stock) exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year testing period. The Recapitalization caused the Company to experience an ownership change. As a result, the Company currently is subject to an annual Section 382 Limitation of approximately $8.5 million in 2000 and 2001 and approximately $5.1 million from 2002 to 2007 on the amount of NOLs generated prior to the Recapitalization that the Company may utilize to offset future taxable income. NOLs generated by the Company since the Recapitalization (approximately $18 million) are not subject to the Section 382 Limitation and may be used to offset future taxable income. There can be no assurance that any NOLs will be able to be used by the Company to offset future taxable income or that such NOLs will not become subject to limitation due to future ownership changes. However, based on the Company's recent and projected performance, management believes that it is more likely than not that the full value of the NOL's will be realized.  SEASONALITY      In general, sales of drugstores items such as prescription drugs, OTC drugs and health and beauty care products exhibit limited seasonality in the aggregate, but do vary by product category. Quarterly results are primarily affected by the timing of new store openings and the sale of seasonal products. In view of the Company's expansion of seasonal merchandising, the Company expects slightly greater revenue sensitivity relating to seasonality in the future.  INFLATION      The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on results of operations for the Company during the three years ended December 25, 1999.                                         18  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" requires that derivative instruments such as options, forward contracts and swaps be recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and provides guidance for recognition of changes in fair value depending on the reason for holding the derivative. The Company does not presently have significant transactions involving derivative instruments, but may do so in the future. The Company is required to adopt Statement No. 133 for the first quarter of 2001 and may adopt it earlier.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MARKET RISK      The financial results of the Company are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates. Variable rate debt outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement was approximately $256 million at December 25, 1999, which is somewhat lower than the Company expects its outstanding variable rate debt to be during the next twelve months. The anticipated outstanding balances, however, are not expected to be materially greater than at December 25, 1999. Based on the December 25, 1999 outstanding balances, a 0.50% change in interest rates would affect pre-tax annual results of operations by approximately $1.3 million. The Company also has $80 million of Senior Notes outstanding at December 25, 1999. These notes, which bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 9 1/4%, are not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations.      The principal objective of the Company's investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate the funding needs of the Company. As part of its investment management, the Company may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps. During 1998, in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement requirements, the Company entered into an interest rate protection agreement for $65.0 million of its floating rate debt. This agreement expires in November of 2000 and caps the LIBOR rate at 6.5% (see note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements).                                         19  ITEM 8.
