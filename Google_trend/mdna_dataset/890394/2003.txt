Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.    Overview             We design, develop, license and market memory technologies used by the semiconductor industry and electronic product manufacturers. We have developed a patented semiconductor memory technology, called 1T-SRAM, that offers a combination of high density, low power consumption and high speed at performance and cost levels that other available memory technologies do not match. We license this technology to companies that incorporate, or embed, memory on complex integrated circuits. We also sell memory chips based on our 1T-SRAM technologies. The sale of our 1T-SRAM memory chips supports the future development and marketing of our 1T-SRAM technology to licensees.             Using elements of our existing memory technology as a foundation, we completed development of our first memory chips incorporating our 1T-SRAM technologies in the fourth quarter of 1998. Through the second quarter of 2001, almost all of our revenue was generated by product sales of our memory chips, however, we anticipate that licensing and royalty revenues will represent the majority of our future revenues.            We signed our first license agreement related to our 1T-SRAM technologies at the end of the fourth quarter of 1998 and recognized licensing revenue from our 1T-SRAM technologies for the first time in the first quarter of 2000. In late 2001 and 2002, we introduced improved and alternative versions of the technology, 1T-SRAM-R, 1T-STRAM-M, and 1T-SRAM-Q.            We generate revenue from intellectual property licensing, which consists of licensing revenue and royalty revenue. Our licensing revenue consists of fees paid for engineering development and engineering support services. We are entitled to receive royalties under each of our licensing agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate our technology.            As of December 31, 2002, we had signed license agreements related to our 1T-SRAM technologies with 31 companies. Generally, we expect our total sales cycle, or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties from the licensee's use of our 1T-SRAM technologies, to run from 18 to 24 months.             On August 30, 2002, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding stock of ATMOS Corporation. ATMOS is a semiconductor memory company that focuses on creating high-density, compiler-generated embedded memory solutions for SoC applications. The total purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $12.4 million including direct transaction costs of $406,000. The consideration paid to ATMOS shareholders consisted of $11.7 million in cash and 26,843 shares of our common stock issued to certain ATMOS employees for a combined total fair value of $12.0 million. Under the purchase method of accounting, the common stock was valued at $11.47 per share using the Company's average stock price for a five-day period consisting of two days before, the day of and two days afterJune 10, 2002, the announcement date on which the number of shares to be issued became fixed. The    28          Company loaned $500,000 to ATMOS under a promissory note due on July 31, 2002, which became non-refundable upon completion of the acquisition, and has been included in the cash portion of the purchase price. ATMOS now operates as our wholly owned subsidiary, and our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002 include the results of operations and financial condition of ATMOS from the date of acquisition.            Revenue.     We generate three types of revenue: licensing, royalty and product revenue. Prior to 2001, almost all our revenue consisted of product revenue from the sale of memory chips. Since the beginning of 2001, product revenue as a percentage of total revenue has declined each quarter while the percentage of our license and royalty revenues has grown each quarter. In the third quarter of 2001, for the first time, combined license and royalty revenue exceeded product revenue. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. In 2003, we anticipate that product revenue will remain weak and licensing and royalty revenues will increase.             Our license agreements involve long sales cycles, which makes it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed. We anticipate that licensing revenue will fluctuate from period to period and that it will be difficult to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue. We believe that the amount of licensing revenues for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period. Our future revenue results are subject to a number of factors, however, particularly those described in Part I., Item I, "BusinessRisk Factors".            We recognized licensing revenue for the first time in the first quarter of 2000. Our licensing revenue consists of fees for providing circuit design, layout and design verification support to a licensee that is embedding our memory technology into its product. For some licensees, we also provide engineering support services to assist commencement of production of their products that utilize 1T-SRAM technologies. Licensing fees range from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars, depending on the scope and complexity of the development project, the licensee's rights and the royalties expected to be received under the agreement. The licensee generally pays licensing fees in installments at the beginning of the license and upon achieving certain milestones. All contracts entered into to date require us to meet performance specifications. For contracts involving performance specifications that we have not met and for which we lack the historical experience to reasonably estimate the costs, we defer the recognition of revenue until the licensee manufactures products that meet the contract performance specifications and recognize revenue using the completed contract method. Fees collected prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred contract revenue. However, if the contracts involve performance specifications that we have significant experience in meeting and the cost of contract completion can be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed under the percentage of completion method. Labor costs incurred are used as a measure of progress towards completion. Under this accounting method, if the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amount of billings to a customer, the excess amount is carried as an unbilled contract receivable. This impacted our revenue for the first time in the second quarter of 2002. Unbilled contract receivable was $693,000 and $0 as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively.             Our license agreements are associated with lengthy and complicated engineering development projects, and so the completion of development and commencement of production may be difficult for us to predict. From time to time, a licensee may cancel a project during the development phase. The cancellation is not within our control and is often caused by changes in market conditions or the licensee's business. Generally, our contracts allow us to retain all payments that we have received or are entitled to collect for items and services provided before the cancellation occurs. We will consider a project to have been canceled even in the absence of specific notice from our licensee if there has been no activity under the contract for a significant period, and we believe that completion of the contract is unlikely. In this event, we recognize revenue in the amount of cash received, if we have performed a sufficient portion of the development services. In 2002, we recognized $804,000 of licensing revenue from cancelled projects compared to $617,000 in 2001. Some of those cancelled contracts were entered into before the technical    29          feasibility was established; therefore, costs associated with those contracts were already expensed prior to the recognition of revenue occurred.             Each licensing agreement provides for royalty payments at a stated rate. We negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the amount of licensing fees to be paid, the anticipated volume of the licensee's sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee from using our technology. Our agreements require licensees to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs. We generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report. We recorded our first royalty revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2000.             The timing and level of royalties also are difficult to predict because they depend on the licensee's ability to market, produce and ship product that incorporates our technology. Under our licensing business model, our future revenue is tied to royalties on the production and sale of our licensees' products. Many of these products are consumer products, such as electronic game players, for which demand is seasonal and generally highest in the fourth quarter, which we would report in the first quarter of the following year. For a discussion of factors that could contribute to the fluctuation of our revenues, please see Part I., Item I, "Risk FactorsOur lengthy licensing cycle and our licensees' lengthy development cycles will make the operating results of our licensing business difficult to predict."            Product sales are typically on a purchase-order basis, with shipment of product from one to six months later. Provisions for estimated returns and to a lesser degree potential warranty liability are recorded at the time revenue is recognized.            Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd., or TSMC, manufactures all of the memory chips that we sell. Our products are assembled and tested prior to shipment by independent, third-party contractors. We contract for manufacturing services on a purchase-order basis and have no long-term commitments for the supply of any of our memory chip products. If we are unable to obtain manufacturing, assembly or testing services required to fill our customer orders for these products, our revenues from these products will decline substantially. Our memory chips are subject to competitive pricing pressure that might result in fluctuating gross profits, which we have experienced in the past. Prior to 1999, we sold most of our memory chips to the personal computer market, which is seasonal, and experienced the strongest demand for these products in the fourth quarter each year. From late 1998 to date, our memory chip sales have consisted primarily of 1T-SRAM chips sold to customers in the communications equipment business, and we have not seen the effect of seasonal demand in the market.            The semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a difficult economic environment and downturn. Most of our memory chip sales are made to communications equipment manufacturers, which experienced a sharp economic downturn since 2001. Our product revenues for 2002 were only 22.5% of our product revenues for 2001. We have limited visibility regarding our customer's chip requirements in 2003 and anticipate further declines in product revenue.            A few customers account for a significant percentage of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2002, our two largest customers, NEC and UMC represented 38.3% and 11.7% of total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, our two largest customers, Cisco Systems, Inc. and NEC represented 21.7% and 18.6% of total revenue, respectively. In 2000, our largest customer was Cisco Systems, which represented 26.2% of our total revenue for the year. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue that year. For information regarding revenues received by us in 2002, 2001 and 2000 from customers residing in the United States or residing in a foreign country, please refer to note 8, "Segment Information," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. For a discussion of factors that could contribute to the fluctuation of our revenues, please see Part IV, Item 1, "Risk FactorsWe expect our revenue to be concentrated.            Cost of Revenue.     Cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacture, assembly and testing of our memory chip products by independent, third-party contractors.    30                  Cost of licensing revenue consists primarily of engineering costs directly related to engineering development projects specified in agreements we have with licensees of our 1T-SRAM technologies. These projects typically include customization of 1T-SRAM circuitry to enable embedding our memory on a licensee's integrated circuit and may include engineering support to assist in the commencement of production of a licensee's products. If licensing revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method, the associated cost of licensing revenue is recognized in the period in which we incur the engineering expense. If licensing revenue is recognized using the completed contract method, and to the extent that the amount of engineering cost does not exceed the amount of the related licensing revenue, this cost is deferred on a contract-by-contract basis from the time we have established technological feasibility of the product to be developed under the license. Technological feasibility is established when we have completed all activities necessary to demonstrate that the licensee's product can be produced to meet the performance specifications when incorporating our technology. Deferred costs are charged to cost of licensing revenue when the related revenue is recognized. However, for contracts entered into prior to establishing technical feasibility, we do not defer related development costs related, but rather expense them in the period in which they are incurred. Consequently, upon completion of these contracts, we recognize the related revenues without any corresponding costs. Furthermore, there are no reported costs associated with royalty revenue.            Research and Development.     Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee expenses, material costs for prototype and test units and expenses associated with engineering development software and equipment. Prior to 1998, our research and development expenses were incurred primarily in support of the design, development and production of memory chips.            Since changing our business model in 1998, we have devoted our research and development efforts primarily to developing our 1T-SRAM technologies and related licensing activities. Research and development expenses can also include development and design of variations of the 1T-SRAM technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees and the development and testing of prototypes to prove the technical feasibility of embedding our memory designs in the licensees' products.            We generally record engineering cost as research and development expense in the period incurred, except when the engineering cost is being deferred under a licensing agreement for which technological feasibility has been established.            Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions to independent sales representatives and professional fees. We pay commissions to our independent sales representatives on most of our sales of memory chips. We have engaged one sales representative in Japan, who receives a commission on licensing revenue generated from licensees that this sales representative introduces to us. Facility and occupancy costs are allocated to each functional department in proportion to its headcount. We seek to leverage our licensing and co-marketing relationships to promote our technology.     Critical Accounting Policies             Use of estimates.     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis we make these estimates based on our historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and reported results could differ under different assumptions or conditions.    31                 We believe that the following accounting policies are affected by estimates and judgments in the following manner:            Revenue.     If a licensing contract involves performance specifications that we have significant experience in meeting and the cost of contract completion can be reasonably estimated, we recognize the revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed using the percentage of completion method. We follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to perform the contracted services. Labor costs for the development of the licensee's design are estimated at the beginning of the contract. As these costs are incurred, they are used as a measure of progress towards completion. We have the ability to reasonably estimate labor cost on a contract-to-contract basis from our experience in developing prior licensee's designs. During the contract performance period we review estimates of cost to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the cost to complete. Our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income for the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known.             Inventory.     We state inventories at the lower of cost or market, determined using the first-in, first-out method. Our policy is to write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to the extent the cost exceeds the estimated market value. We base the estimate on our assumptions about historical and forecasted sales within twelve months period and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed in our estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Our policy is to reflect any write-down of inventory in reported income for the period in which the facts giving rise to the inventory write-down become known.            Impairment of long-lived assets.     We routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used, we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset's carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset's new carrying value. We may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change.            Impairment of Goodwill.     According to our accounting policy, we performed an annual review of goodwill recorded from the acquisition of ATMOS in August 2002, during the fourth quarter of 2002, and we found no impairment. We will perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenue for the enterprise, driven by assumed market growth rates and assumed market segment share, and estimated costs as well as appropriate discount rates. Changes in our estimate could result in substantial charges for impairment of goodwill.            Tax valuation allowance.     When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet. The net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we must record a tax expense in our statement of operations. Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Our net deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2002 was $2.4 million, net of the valuation allowance of $0.7 million. The deferred tax assets consist primarily of deductible temporary differences, tax credit carryforwards, and net operating losses.    32       NAME="page_do1193_1_33">        Results of Operations             The table set forth below shows our results of operations for the past three years, expressed as a percentage of revenue.             Year ended  December 31,             2002     2001     2000       Net revenue:                            Product     10.5  %  57.8  %  89.9  %       Licensing.     37.9     26.9     10.0          Royalty     51.6     15.3     0.1                                 100.0     100.0     100.0        Cost of net revenue:                               Product     6.0     25.7     37.6          Licensing     6.2     2.8     3.6                                 12.2     28.5     41.2                           Gross profit     87.8     71.5     58.8                            Operating expenses:                               Research and development     23.7     19.7     23.2          Selling, general and administrative     17.8     20.8     24.6          Stock-based compensation charge     2.4     6.4     7.6                                 Total operating expenses     43.9     46.9     55.4                           Income from operations     43.9     24.6     3.4       Interest and other income     5.5     8.1     8.0       Provision for income taxes     (4.9  )  (1.6  )  (2.1  )                        Net income     44.5  %  31.1  %  9.3  %                           Years Ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000             Revenue.     In 2002, total revenue increased to $27.8 million from $22.5 million representing a 23.6% increase over 2001. This increase is primarily due to the significant growth in our revenues from licensing and royalty activities, which increased to $24.9 million from $9.5 million in 2001 a 162% increase. Our royalty revenue increased from $3.4 million in 2001 to $14.3 million in 2002, a 316% increase. In 2002, royalties earned from the production of Gamecube chips incorporating our 1T-SRAM technology represented a significant portion of our revenue. Gamecube-related revenue represented 44.1% of total revenue in 2002, an increase from 22.9% of total revenue in 2001because of increased sales of that product. The royalty revenues from other licensees also increased in 2002 while we simultaneously increased and diversified our licensees and development projects in 2002.            In 2001, total revenue increased 56.8% to $22.5 million from $14.3 million in 2000 due to the strong growth of our licensing revenue, which increased to $6.1 million from $1.4 million and in royalty revenue, which increased to $3.4 million from insignificant levels. Most of the 2001 licensing and royalty revenue consisted of our engineering services associated with NEC's development of chips for the Nintendo Gamecube video game console and royalties earned from the subsequent production of Gamecube chips incorporating our 1T-SRAM technology. We also earned licensing revenue from a number of development projects with other licensees. In 2000, the majority of our revenue came from product sales of $12.9 million, however, we recognized our first 1T-SRAM technology licensing and royalty revenues, which totaled $1.4 million.    33                  During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, product sales were $2.9 million, $13.0 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Sales of memory chips declined to 10.5% of 2002 revenue from 57.8% of 2001 revenue and 89.9% of 2000 revenue as we shifted our primary focus from product sales to the licensing of our 1T-SRAM technologies. In addition, our product sales fell in 2002 due to significant downturns in the semiconductor industry and the communications equipment business, which is the primary market for our memory chips. We expect continued weakness in product revenue in 2003 and do not anticipate increases until sales of communications equipment increase substantially.             Gross Profit.     In 2002, gross profit increased to $24.4 million because of the significant increase in licensing and royalty revenue, which represented $23.1 million of the total gross profit for the year. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to 87.8% in 2002 from 71.5% due to the significantly higher proportion of licensing and royalty revenues, which have much higher gross profit margins than product revenues. In 2002, royalty gross profit as a percentage of royalty revenue was 100% and licensing gross profit as a percentage of licensing revenue declined to 83.6% compared to 89.5% in 2001. In 2002, 25.2% of our licensing revenue came from the contracts accounted under the completed contract method compared to 68.8% of licensing revenue in 2001. The majority of these contracts were entered into before technical feasibility was established; therefore, costs associated with these contracts were already expensed prior to the recognition of revenue occurring. In 2002, we recognized revenue on the last of these remaining completed contracts, and, therefore, expect the gross margin percentage from future licensing revenue to be lower than the current level because we will generally record revenues and costs in the same period under our current contracts. In 2001, gross profit increased to $16.1 million from $8.4 million in 2000 due to strong growth in licensing and royalty revenues, which contributed $8.9 million to the total gross profit for the year. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to 71.5% in 2001 from 58.8% in 2000 due to the significantly higher proportion of licensing and royalty revenues. In 2001, licensing gross profit as a percentage of licensing revenue was 89.5% and royalty gross profit as a percentage of royalty revenue was 100%. In addition, in 2000, we recognized licensing and royalty revenue for the first time, which contributed $933,000 to gross profit for the year.            Product gross margin as a percentage of product revenue declined to 43.0% in 2002 compared to 55.5% in 2001. This decline occurred because there were far fewer units of product shipped in 2002, while total manufacturing fixed costs were similar in corresponding periods. In 2000, total gross profit was $8.4 million of which gross profit from product revenue represented $7.5 million. In 2000, our decision to shift our focus to the sale of 1T-SRAM memory chips to communications equipment manufacturers resulted in lower unit shipments of memory chips but higher selling prices and gross margins than we had realized from sales of our other memory chip products in prior years.            Research and Development.     In 2002, research and development expense increased to $6.6 million due to additions to the engineering staff from additional hiring and our acquisition of ATMOS in August 2002 to support to our expanded licensing activities. ATMOS research and development expenses represented approximately $867,000 in 2002. Engineering expense incurred in 2002 and recorded as cost of license revenue was $1.4 million. In 2001, research and development expense increased to $4.4 million due to additions to the engineering staff, and expanded engineering support to our licensing activities. We also established an engineering design center in Seoul, Korea in June 2001. Engineering expense incurred in 2001 and recorded as cost of license revenue was $597,000. Research and development expense was $3.3 million in 2000 mainly to support continued development of the 1T-SRAM technology and our expanding licensing activities. We recorded approximately $333,000 of engineering expense, incurred in 2000, as cost of license revenue. Research and development expenses as a percent of total revenue were 23.7%, 19.7% and 23.2% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.            Selling, General and Administrative.     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $5.0 million in 2002 from $4.7 million in 2001 as increases in administrative, intellectual property sales and marketing staff expenses were partially offset by lower product sales commissions. In 2001, selling, general    34           and administrative expense increased to $4.7 million, an increase of approximately 33.0% from the preceding year. The increase in 2001 reflected the addition of administrative, sales and marketing staff and the expansion of intellectual property marketing activities. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by 47.5% from the prior year to $3.5 million in 2000 due to the expansion of our sales and marketing activities in selling memory chips and licensing our technology. In addition, our rent and facility expense increased with our July 2000 move into additional space in our existing headquarters building. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue were 17.8%, 20.8% and 24.6% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.            Interest and Other Income.     Interest income reflects interest earned on average cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments. Interest income was $1.5, $1.8 million and $1.1 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The fluctuation in interest income levels corresponds to differences in average cash and investment balances for the periods and the interest rates, which declined significantly in 2002. In 2001, interest income increased due to higher average cash balances, which included proceeds from our July 2001 initial public offering, and was partially offset by a decline in interest rates. Interest income in 2000 included interest earned on cash received from a preferred stock financing of $5.2 million in May 2000 and the receipt of $5.2 million of contract fee payments during 2000. We incurred no interest expense in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Interest and other income as a percent of total revenue were 5.5%, 8.1% and 8.0% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.            Deferred stock-based compensation cost to employees.     During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, we recorded deferred compensation of approximately $314,000, $1.5 million, and $2.4 million, respectively. The 2002 deferred compensation cost represented the shares of common stock issued to certain employees of ATMOS that were subject to vesting requirements related to the acquisition of ATMOS, which is being amortized over the vesting period of 36 months using the graded vesting method. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded amortization expense of $74,000 related to deferred compensation from those shares. The deferred compensation recorded during the years ended 2001 and 2000 represented the difference between the grant price and the fair market value of the common stock for financial statement reporting purposes during the period in which the options were granted. Deferred compensation expense is being amortized using the graded vesting method, in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and FASB Interpretation No. 28, over the vesting period of each respective option, generally four years. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, we recorded amortization expense of $582,000, $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to the deferred compensation arising from the difference in stock options grant price and fair value of our common stock.            Provision for Income Taxes.     Provisions for income taxes of approximately $1.4 million, $367,000, and $308,000 were recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, we had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $2.5 million for federal tax purposes and approximately $900,000 for state tax purposes that we expect to be available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and applicable state income tax laws. Those net operating losses are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $2.6 million pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Those net operating loss carry-forwards expire from 2003 to 2020. In 2003, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be less than the full corporate tax rate but higher than 2002 for financial reporting purposes.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             As of December 31, 2002, we had cash and cash equivalents of $26.3 million, short-term investments of $42.1 million and long-term investments of $11.4 million. As of the same date, the Company had total working capital of $71.2 million. In July 2001, the Company completed the sale of a total of 5,750,000 shares of common stock in its initial public offering. The Company realized total net proceeds of approximately $51.6 million upon the close of the IPO. Our primary capital requirements are to fund    35           working capital needs. We believe that our current focus on licensing and royalty revenues and reduced levels of memory chip sales has lessened the volatility of our business and generally have enabled us to steadily improve our cash position.            Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.9 million, $8.4 million and $4.7 million for the years ended 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. In 2002, net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income of $12.4 million, non-cash charge of depreciation and amortization for $1.3 million. The increases in those items were reduced by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.9 million, mainly due to recording deferred tax assets for $2.4 million related to a realization of tax benefits by utilizing net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, reductions of net cash provided by operating activities included decreases in deferred revenue of $1.6 million and accounts payable of $1.3 million. Deferred revenue decreased in 2002 due to the recognition of the prepaid royalties and licensing revenues recognized under the completed contract method of accounting during 2002. In 2001, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.4 million, consisting principally of net profit of $7.0 million plus a non-cash charge of $1.4 million for stock based compensation. In addition, we reduced accounts receivable by $1.2 million but decreased deferred revenue by $2.6 million. The reduction in deferred revenue in 2001 resulted from the recognition of licensing and prepaid royalty revenues in excess of additional license fees collected from our customers. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2000 was principally represented by our net profit of $1.3 million plus a non-cash charge of $1.1 million for stock based compensation. In addition, in 2000, we received license fees of $5.2 million, which were recorded as deferred revenue and which were partially offset by the recognition of $1.4 million of license revenue. Cash generated by operations in 2000 also was offset by an inventory increase of $1.1 million.            Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $30.1 million, $38.4 million, and $659,000 for the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, investing activities principally related to cash payments totaling $12.0 million for the acquisition of AMTOS and investing in short-term and long-term marketable securities of $16.5 million, net. Additionally, we purchased $1.4 million of property and equipment in 2002, which consisted principally of engineering design software. In 2001, investing activities consisted mainly of engineering design software purchases and the establishment of our engineering design center in Korea. In addition, in 2001, we invested in short-term marketable securities of $36.9 million, net.            Net cash provided by financing activities were $1.2 million, $54.0 million, and $6.6 million for the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000. In 2002, financing activities consisted primarily of cash received upon the issuance of common stock for $909,000 in connection with the exercise of options. In 2001, we received total net proceeds of $51.6 million upon the close of our IPO. In addition, we received $2.0 million from the exercise of warrants and common stock options. In 2000, we received $5.2 million from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and $1.4 million from the exercise of common stock options and a warrant.            Our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter, depending on numerous factors, including       level and timing of licensing, royalty and memory chip sales revenues;  cost, timing and success of technology development efforts;  market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products;  competing technological and market developments;  cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights; and  variations in manufacturing yields, materials costs and other manufacturing risks;  costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations.    36                     We expect that the net proceeds of our initial public offering, together with our existing capital and cash generated from operations, if any, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We expect that a licensing business such as ours generally will require less cash to support operations after multiple licensees begin to ship products and pay royalties. However, we cannot be certain that we will not require additional financing at some point in time. Should our cash resources prove inadequate, we might need to raise additional funding through public or private financing. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. The failure to raise capital when needed could have a material, adverse effect on our business and financial condition.    Lease Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Financing              The impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:             Payment Due by Period          Total     Less than 1 year     1-3 years     4-5 years     Over 5 years    Operating Lease Obligations     $  3,898     $  1,159     $  2,288     $  315     $  136    Capital Lease Obligations        119        92        15        12                       The Company did not have any unconditional purchase obligations as of December 31, 2002.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"), "Business Combinations." SFAS 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method. We have adopted SFAS 141. The purchase method of accounting was used for the acquisition of ATMOS.             In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which is effective for fiscal years beginning after March 15, 2001. SFAS 142 requires, among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization. In addition, the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles. We test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and no impairment changes were recorded as of December 31, 2002.            In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", which is required to be applied starting with years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS 144 requires, amongst other things, the application model for long-lived assets that are impaired or to be disposed of by sale. The Company has adopted SFAS 144 and does not anticipate having a material effect on our financial position, results of operation, or cash flows.            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" (SFAS No. 146), requires us to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 replaces Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The effect of adoption of SFAS No. 146 is dependent on our related activities subsequent to the date of adoption.    37                  In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure" (SFAS 148). SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition guidance and annual disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We are required to adopt the interim disclosure provisions for financial reports in its fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. We will continue to account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" using the "intrinsic value" method. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 148 is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.            In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued. The recognition provisions of FIN 45 are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.            In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will have on its results of operations and financial condition.    NAME="do1193_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite03081">      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussion of Market Interest Rate Risk                  Our investment portfolio consists of money market funds, corporate-backed debt obligations and mortgage-backed government obligations generally due within one year. Our primary objective with its investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. These securities, which approximate $76.2 million as of December 31, 2002, and have an average interest rate of approximately 2.15%, are subject to interest rate risks. However, based on the investment portfolio contents and our ability to hold these investments until maturity, we believe that if a significant change in interest rates were to occur, it would not have a material effect on our financial condition.
