Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read inconjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.   Overview            Our strategy and primary business objective is to become a fabless semiconductor company focused on the development and sale ofintegrated circuits, or ICs, for the high-speed networking, communications, storage and computing markets. Our technology delivers time-to-market, performance,power and economic benefits for system original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. We have developed a family of ICs, called Bandwidth Engine, which combines our proprietary 1T-SRAMhigh-density embedded memory and high-speed 10 Gigabits per second, or Gbps, serial interface, or I/O, with our intelligent access technology and a highly efficient interfaceprotocol. Historically, our primary business was the design, development, marketing, sale and support of differentiated intellectual property, or IP, including embedded memory andhigh-speed parallel and serial I/O used in advanced systems-on-chips, or SoCs. We are focused on developing differentiated IP-rich IC products, such asthe Bandwidth Engine, and are dedicating substantially all our R&D, marketing and sales budget to these IC products.           Sincethe beginning of 2010, we have invested an increasing amount of our research and development resources towards development of our Bandwidth Engine family of ICs. Our future successand ability to achieve and maintain profitability will be dependent on the marketing and sales of our Bandwidth Engine IC products into networking, communications and other markets requiring highbandwidth memory access. During 2011, we began placing less emphasis on IP licensing and deploying more resources towards our IC product development and marketing efforts. In December 2011, we sold anumber of patents in an arrangement that provided $35 million in cash with no equity dilution to the Company. We are using the proceeds from this sale to partially fund our investment in ourBandwidth Engine IC product line. We retained a license to the sold patents to cover our Bandwidth Engine IC product line and to execute current business with our IP technology customers and partners.However, the retained license limits, among other things, the number of future licenses of 1T-SRAM memory technology that we can grant to developers of SoCs, which, at one time, were aprincipal focus of our 1T-SRAM licensing activities. We still maintain a large patent portfolio with over 100 patents granted and more in process.           Historically,our primary business has been defining, designing, marketing and licensing differentiated embedded memory and high-speed parallel and serial interface IP foradvanced SoCs designs. Revenue from IP licensing and royalties represented the majority of our revenues for 2012, and we expect revenue from IP licensing and royalties to represent a significantportion of our revenues in 2013. Due to the shift in our engineering and research and development focus and the decline in major consumer electronics applications utilizing customized versions of our1T-SRAM technology, our competitiveness and the demand for our IP have declined since the beginning of 2011. As a result of our reduced licensing activities, we expect our licensing androyalty revenue to decrease in future periods. Our expectation is that our revenue will transition from primarily licensing and royalty to predominately IC product sales. To date, we havesubstantially completed our performance obligations under our existing agreements, and we expect licensing revenues to decline in 2013. We have also been focused on monetizing our IP portfolio to fundthe change in our business. Towards this end, we have completed asset sales for proceeds of approximately $39.3 million, including our December 2011 patent sale and March 2012 SerDes technologysale.   30                           The 1T-SRAM is our high-density, high-performance patented memory solution that represents an alternative to traditionalvolatile embedded memory. Our I/O IP includes physical layer (PHY) circuitry that allows ICs to communicate with one another in the networking, storage, computer and consumer market segments. Our PHYIP supports serial interface technologies, such as 10 Gbps Base KR, XAUI, PCI Express and SATA, as well as parallel interfaces like DDR3. Our IP customers typically include fabless semiconductorcompanies, integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and foundries.    Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates            Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ofAmerica. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidatedfinancial statements.           Wehave identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies may involve estimates andjudgments thataffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from our estimates, and ifdifferent assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.     Revenue Recognition     Licensing             Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services and support and maintenance. License feesgenerally range from $100,000 to several million dollars per contract, depending on the scope and complexity of the development project, and the extent of the licensee's rights. The vast majority ofour contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed. Fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of anarrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of signedagreements. When sales arrangements contain multiple elements (e.g., license and services), we review each element to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement.If more than one unit of accounting exists, the consideration payable to us under the agreement is allocated to each unit of accounting using the relative fair value method. Revenue is recognized foreach unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that unit of accounting.           Forstand-alone license agreements or license deliverables in multi-deliverable arrangements that do not require significant development, modification or customization, revenue isrecognized when all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Delivery of the licensed technology is typically the final revenue recognition criterion met, at which time revenue is recognized. Ifany of the criteria are not met, revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria have been met.           Forlicense agreements that include deliverables requiring significant production, modification or customization, and where we have significant experience in meeting the designspecifications involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue over the period in which the contractservices are performed. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion ofprojects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. Thesejudgmental elements include determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimating the total direct labor hours. We follow this method because we can obtainreasonably   31        dependableestimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contract services. The direct labor hours for the development of the licensee's design are estimated at the beginning of the contract. Asthese direct labor hours are incurred, they are used as a measure of progress towards completion. We have the ability to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours on acontract-by-contract basis based on our experience in developing prior licensees' designs. During the contract performance period, we review estimates of direct labor hours tocomplete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours tocomplete. Our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income or loss in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known. Under thepercentage of completion method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined to be likely. If the amount of revenuerecognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer, then the excess amount is recorded as an unbilled contracts receivable.           Weprovide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements. Under these arrangements, we provide unspecified upgrades, design rule changes and technical support. No otherupgrades, products or other post-contract support are provided. Support and maintenance revenue is recognized at its fair value established by vendor-specific objective evidence, ratablyover the period during which the obligation exists, typically 12 months. These arrangements are generally renewable annually by the customer.     Royalty             Royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our memory licensing agreements that require our licensees to reportroyalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our memory IP. Our license agreements require the licensee to report themanufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs. We recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive thelicensee's report. Under limited circumstances, we may also recognize prepaid post-production royalties as revenue upon execution of the contract, which are paid in a lump sum after thelicensee commences production of the royalty- bearing product and applied against future unit shipments regardless of the actual level of shipments by the licensee. The criteria for revenuerecognition of prepaid royalties are that a formal agreement with the licensee is executed, no deliverables, development or support services related toprepaid royalties are required, the fees are non-refundable and not contingent upon future product shipments by the licensee, and the fees are payable by the licensee in a time periodconsistent with our normal billing terms. If any of these criteria are not met, we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met.           Aswith our licensing revenue, the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict. They depend on the licensee's ability to market, produce and sell products incorporating ourtechnology. Many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are used in consumer products, such as electronic game consoles, for which demand can be seasonal.     IC products             Products are sold both directly to customers, as well as through distributors. Revenue from sales directly to customers is generallyrecognized at the time of shipment. We record an estimated allowance, at the time of shipment, for future returns and other charges against revenue consistent with the terms of sale. IC productrevenue and costs relating to sales made through distributors with rights of return and stock rotation are deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers due to our inability toestimate future returns and credits to be issued. Distributors are generally able to return up to 10% of their purchases of slow, non-moving or obsolete inventory for credit every sixmonths. At the time of shipment to distributors, an accounts receivable for the selling price is recorded,   32        asthere is a legally enforceable right to receive payment, and inventory is relieved, as legal title to the inventory is transferred upon shipment. Revenues are recognized upon receiving notificationfrom the distributors that products have been sold to end customers. Distributors provide information regarding products and quantity, end customer shipments and remaining inventory on hand. Theassociated deferred margin is included in the deferred revenues line item in the consolidated balance sheet. We recorded initial IC product revenue in 2012, and a significant reserve for returns hasbeen recorded due to the product's early stage of development and testing. IC product revenue was not significant in 2012, and has been included in the licensing and other revenue line item in theconsolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.     Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments             We measure the fair value of financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniquesused to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:    Level 1Inputsused to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   Level 2Pricingis provided by third party sources of market information obtained from investment advisors rather than models. We do not adjust for or apply any additionalassumptions or estimates to the pricing information we receive from advisors. Our Level 2 securities include cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, whichconsisted primarily of corporate debt, and government agency and municipal debt securities from issuers with high quality credit ratings. Our investment advisors obtain pricing data from independentsources, such as Standard & Poor's, Bloomberg and Interactive Data Corporation, and rely on comparable pricing of other securities because the Level 2 securities we hold are not activelytraded and have fewer observable transactions. We consider this the most reliable information available for the valuation of the securities.   Level 3Unobservableinputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment are used to measure fair value. These valuesare generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions. The determination of fair value for Level 3 investmentsand other financial instruments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity.    Valuation of long-lived Assets             We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when a triggering event is deemed tohave occurred. This assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results, projected cash flows and current period market capitalizationlevels. If our estimates and assumptions change in the future, it could result in a material write-down of long-lived assets. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets,such as developed technology, customer relationships and patent license, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to seven years. We recognize an impairment chargeas the difference between the net book value of such assets and the fair value of the assets on the measurement date.     Goodwill             We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of anasset may not be recoverable. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is lessthan the carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If the qualitative assessment warrants further analysis, we compare thefair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the   33        marketapproach. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired, and no further testing is performed. If the carryingvalue of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference. We have determined that we have a single reporting unit forpurposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. We performed the annual impairment test in September 2012, and the test did not indicate impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2012, wedid not identify any factors to indicate there was an impairment of our goodwill and determined that no additional impairment analysis was required.     Deferred tax valuation allowance             When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions wherewe conduct business. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accountingpurposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets. The net deferred tax assets are reduced by avaluation allowance if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We must make significant judgments todetermine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset.     Stock-based compensation             We recognize stock-based compensation for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, usuallythe vesting period, based on the grant-date fair value. We estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of fair valueof share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option- pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables.These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The expected termof options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility ofour stock price.    Results of Operations      Net Revenue.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2012      2011      2010      2011 to 2012      2010 to 2011              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Licensing and other     $  1,340     $  5,987     $  6,468     $  (4,647  )      (78  )%  $  (481  )      (7  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        22  %     42  %     42  %                                                  Licensingrevenue decreased $4.6 million in 2012 due to the lack of new license agreements and a decline in the number of residual fee-generating license agreements.License revenue recognized in 2012 was generated solely from agreements entered into in 2011 and prior years. We expect our licensing revenue to decrease in 2013 as we will not be pursuing new IPlicenses, and our sales and marketing personnel will be focusing on selling ICs.           Licensingrevenue decreased $0.5 million in 2011 due to a decline in the number and value of new license agreements. Licensing revenue in 2011 included significant revenuerecognized from the   34        achievementof final milestones for two 1T-SRAM technology license agreements executed in the fourth quarter of 2009.                                        Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2012      2011      2010      2011 to 2012      2010 to 2011              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Royalty     $  4,742     $  8,120     $  9,095     $  (3,378  )      (42  )%  $  (975  )      (11  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        78  %     58  %     58  %                                                  Royaltyrevenue decreased $3.4 million in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in shipments by an IDM licensee whose product is used in the Nintendo Wii® game console andTSMC, a major foundry partner. We expect royalty revenues to decrease in 2013, primarily due to reduced shipments by the IDM licensee, as Nintendo has introduced a new console that does notincorporate our technology. In addition, we expect decline in shipments of units incorporating our technology by other licensees, as their products approach their end of life.           Royaltyrevenue decreased $1.0 million in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in shipments by an IDM licensee whose product is used in the Nintendo Wii® game console,although we did experience an increase in royalties received from TSMC and from another licensee due to higher manufacturing volumes for their products.     Cost of Net Revenue and Gross Profit.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2012      2011      2010      2011 to 2012      2010 to 2011              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Cost of net revenue     $  334     $  3,295     $  2,826     $  (2,961  )      (90  )%  $  469        17  %      Percentage of total net revenue        5  %     23  %     18  %                                                                                  Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2012      2011      2010      2010 to 2011      2009 to 2010              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Gross profit     $  5,748     $  10,812     $  12,737     $  (5,064  )      (47  )%  $  (1,925  )      (15  )%      Gross margin        95  %     77  %     82  %                                                  Costof net revenue consists of personnel and related overhead allocation costs for engineers assigned to revenue-generating licensing arrangements and direct and indirect costs relatedto the sale of IC products.           Costof net revenue decreased in 2012, primarily due to the lack of new licensing agreements and reduced requirements for engineering services on existing contracts. Cost of net revenuein 2012 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.1 million, a decrease of $0.3 million compared with 2011. Total gross profit decreased to $5.7 million in 2012 primarilydue to the decrease in license and royalty revenues. We expect that the cost of licensing revenue will decrease in absolute dollars in the future because we anticipate entering into few, if any,license agreements. This decrease will be offset by increased IC cost of net revenue from sales of our Bandwidth Engine ICs. We expect cost as a percentage of total net revenue to increase as wegenerate additional revenue from the sale of ICs rather than the licensing of IP.           Costof net revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to two 1T-SRAM projects that were substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 in which we expensed$1.2 million of previously capitalized deferred costs. Cost of net revenue in 2011 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million, an increase of $0.1 million comparedwith 2010. Total gross profit decreased to   35        $10.8 millionin 2011 primarily due to the lower margin contribution from the two 1T-SRAM projects and the decrease in royalty revenues.     Research and Development.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2012      2011      2010      2011 to 2012      2010 to 2011              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Research and development     $  28,480     $  26,216     $  25,534     $  2,264        9  %  $  682        3  %      Percentage of total net revenue        468  %     186  %     164  %                                                  Ourresearch and development expenses include costs related to the development of our IC products and amortization of technology-based intangible assets. We expense research anddevelopment costs as they are incurred.           The$2.3 million increase in 2012 was primarily due to increases in our mask tooling and other fabrication costs and stock-based compensation charges, partially offset bydecreases in personnel-related costs resulting from lower headcount and lower amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets.           The$0.7 million increase in 2011 was primarily due to increases in license costs for our CAD software tools, costs related to the development of our Bandwidth Engine IC andstock-based compensation charges, offset by a decrease in acquisition-related contingent compensation charges.           Researchand development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million, $2.0 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31,2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect that research and development expenses will remain flat or decrease slightly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue as our averageheadcount and related personnel costs are expected to be lower in 2013 as compared to 2012. The primary driver of research and development expense will be our continued investment in our current andnext generation IC products.     Selling, General and Administrative.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2012      2011      2010      2011 to 2012      2010 to 2011              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Selling, general and administrative     $  8,218     $  8,869     $  10,391     $  (651  )      (7  )%  $  (1,522  )      (15  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        135  %     63  %     67  %                                                  Selling,general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, finance, human resources and general management.           The$0.7 million decrease for 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related, legal and stock-based compensation costs.           The$1.5 million decrease for 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related, acquisition-related and consulting costs.           Selling,general and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million, $1.4 million and $1.5 million for the years endedDecember 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect total selling, general and administrative expenses to remain flat or slightly decrease in absolute dollars.   36                     Gain on Sale of Assets.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2012      2011      2010      2011 to 2012      2010 to 2011              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Gain on sale of assets     $  3,291     $  35,611     $       $  (32,230  )      (91  )%  $  35,611        100  %      Percentage of total net revenue        54  %     252  %                                                          InMarch 2012, we entered into an asset purchase agreement for an exclusive license of a portion of our intellectual property pertaining to our high-speed serial I/Otechnology for approximately $4.3 million. As part of the agreement, we provided certain technology transfer support services, and 15 employees of our India subsidiary accepted employment withthe purchaser. In 2012, we received approximately $3.4 million in cash, net of transaction costs, from this agreement, and we expect to receive an additional $0.6 million in March 2013.           InDecember 2011, we entered into a patent purchase agreement for the sale of 43 United States and 30 related foreign memory technology patents for $35.0 million in cash. Werecognized a $35.6 million gain on this transaction. The gain was comprised of the $35.0 million of proceeds, plus $0.8 million, which we determined to be the value of ourretained license to these patents, net of transaction costs.     Other Income and Expense, net.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2012      2011      2010      2011 to 2012      2010 to 2011              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Other income and expense, net     $  155     $  206     $  177     $  (51  )      (25  )%  $  29        16  %      Percentage of total net revenue        3  %     1  %     1  %                                                  Otherincome and expense, net primarily consisted of interest income on our investments, which was $0.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the years endedDecember 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest income increased by $28,000 in 2012 due to a higher average investment balance and declined by $129,000 in 2011 primarily due to loweraverage investment balances and lower interest rates earned. The increase in interest income was offset by increases in other expenses.     Income Tax Provision.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2012      2011      2010      2011 to 2012      2010 to 2011              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Income tax provision     $  110     $  288     $  51     $  (178  )      (62  )%  $  237        465  %      Percentage of total net revenue        2  %     2  %                                                          Our2012 and 2010 income tax provisions were primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions. Our 2011 income tax provision was attributable to the federal alternative minimum tax, as wewere profitable in 2011, and foreign jurisdictions.           Asof December 31, 2012, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $80.6 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and approximately $86.5 millionfor state income tax purposes that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and state income tax laws. The federal net operating loss carryforwardsexpire from 2025 to 2032, and state net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2013 to 2032. In 2013, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federalstatutory tax rate because of expected losses.   37                Asof December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had net deferred tax assets of approximately $43.8 million and $32.4 million, respectively. Because of uncertainties regardingthe realization of deferred tax assets, we had recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.    Liquidity and Capital Resources            As of December 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $40.7 million compared with a combinedbalance of $58.0 million at December 31, 2011. Our principal source of cash in 2011 was the sale of patents for $35 million in December 2011. In December 2010, we soldapproximately 5 million shares of common stock in a registered direct equity offering, raising approximately $20 million, net of transaction expenses of approximately$0.1 million. The offering was made under our $50 million shelf registration statement that became effective in November 2010. Our primary capital requirements are to fund workingcapital, including development of our IC products, and any acquisitions that we make that require cash consideration or expenditures.           In2012, we used $22.0 million in operating activities, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $27.6 million and the $3.3 million gain on the sale of assets,adjusted for non-cash charges consisting of stock-based compensation of $3.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $2.7 million and $2.4 million generated fromchanges in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers, collection of receivables, recognition of revenue relatedto deferred revenues and payments to vendors.           In2011, we used $15.7 million in operating activities, which primarily resulted from the net income of $11.3 million and $1.3 million generated from changes inoperating assets and liabilities, reduced by the $35.6 million gain on the sale of patents and adjusted for non-cash charges consisting of stock-based compensation of$3.8 million and depreciation and amortization of $3.7 million. The changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers, collection of receivablesand payments to vendors.           In2010, we used $15.6 million in operating activities, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $23.1 million, partially offset by non-cash chargesconsisting of stock-based compensation expense of $3.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.8 million and $0.4 million generated from changes in operating assets andliabilities. The changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers, collection of receivables and payments to vendors.           Ourinvesting activities in 2012 primarily consisted of $3.4 million received, net of transaction costs, for the sale of assets and $0.7 million for purchases of fixedassets. Remaining investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketable securities, which did not affect our liquidity.           Ourinvesting activities in 2011 included the payment of $1.5 million in deferred consideration for the MagnaLynx acquisition in 2010 and the purchase of $0.3 million offixed assets.           Ourinvesting activities in 2010 included business acquisition payments of $7.9 million, of which $4.6 million related to a contingent payment related to the acquisition ofPrism Circuits and $3.3 million related to the acquisition of MagnaLynx in the first quarter of 2010. In 2010, we purchased $1.4 million of fixed assets. Remaining investing activitiesconsisted of investing our cash in marketable securities.           Ourfinancing activities in 2012 primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by a repurchase and retirement of common stock.           Ourfinancing activities in 2011 primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Our cash from financing activities in 2010 consisted of the proceeds of ourregistered direct offering of common stock and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.   38                Ourfuture liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter, depending on numerous factors, including:     level of revenue;    cost, timing and success of technology development efforts, including meeting customer design specifications;      fabrication costs, including mask costs of our ICs, currently under development;      variations in manufacturing yields, materials costs and other manufacturing risks;      costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations; and      profitability of our business.            Weexpect our cash expenditures to continue to exceed receipts in 2013 as our revenues will not be sufficient to offset our operating expenses, which include significant research anddevelopment expenditures for the expansion and fabrication of our IC products. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, along with our existing capital and cash generated fromoperations, if any, to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that we need to obtain additional capital prior to achieving positive operating cash flows.We have not determined what actions we will take to obtain such capital. We do have a shelf registration allowing us to sell up to approximately $30 million of our securities from time to timeuntil November 2013. We also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in our interests, including, but not limited to, from thesale of our debt and/or equity securities under our existing shelf registration statement. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.The failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.    Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments            The impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow infuture periods is as follows (in thousands):                                  Payment Due by Period              Total      Less than 1 year      1-3 years      3-5 years      More than 5 years          Operating leases     $  5,673     $  739     $  1,484     $  1,507     $  1,943         Purchase commitments        1,944        878        1,066                                                                   $  7,617     $  1,617     $  2,550     $  1,507     $  1,943                                                       Asof December 31, 2012, our purchase commitments were for licenses related to computer-aided design tools payable through 2015. In July 2010, we entered into a 10 yearoperating lease agreement for approximately 47,000 square feet with Mission West Properties, Inc. (sold to M West Propco XII, LLC in December 2012) for our corporate headquarters inSanta Clara, California.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements            We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material currentor future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.   39         Indemnifications            In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter-party fromlosses relating to a breach of representations and warranties, a failure to perform certain covenants, or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particularcontract, which may include, for example, losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. We have alsoentered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk         Interest rate risk            We have exposure to interest rate risk due to our investment portfolio. Our investments are made in accordance with an investmentpolicy under the guidance of the audit committee of our board of directors. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and meet liquidity needs. To achieve thisobjective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agency debt, municipalnotes, corporate notes and bonds, certificates of deposit, and money market funds. We place our investments with high-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of creditexposure with any one issuer or fund.           Theinvestments, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains andlosses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Securities with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Securities withoriginal maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Securities with remaining maturities greater than oneyear are classified as long-term investments. All investments have a maturity of less than two years. No single security should exceed 5% of the portfolio or $2.0 million at thetime of purchase. The portfolio's dollar- weighted average maturity of investments is within 12 months. These securities, which approximated $40.4 million as of December 31, 2012and earned an average annual interest rate of approximately 0.3% in 2012, are subject to interest rate and credit risks. As of December 31, 2012, we performed a sensitivity analysis on ourinvestment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/- 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately$0.1 million. We do not have any investments denominated in foreign currencies, and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments.    Foreign currency exchange rate risk            Currently, all of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as a result, we have not experienced significant foreignexchange gains or losses to date. However,the expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in their local currencies, therefore we have risk of foreign exchange gains and losses through the funding of those expenditures. We do notcurrently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. However, in theevent our exposure   40        toforeign currency risk increases, we may choose to hedge those exposures. For most currencies, we are a net payer of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar and areadversely affected by a weaker U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies.
