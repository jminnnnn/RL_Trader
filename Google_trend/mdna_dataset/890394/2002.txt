Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.    Overview             We design, develop, license and market memory technologies used by the semiconductor industry and electronic product manufacturers. We have developed a patented semiconductor memory technology, called 1T-SRAM, that offers a combination of high density, low power consumption, high speed and low cost that other available memory technologies do not match. We license this technology to companies that incorporate, or embed, memory on complex integrated circuits. We also sell memory chips based on our 1T-SRAM technology. The sale of our 1T-SRAM memory chips supports the future development and marketing of our 1T-SRAM technology to licensees.             Until the second quarter of 2001, almost all of our revenue was generated by product sales of memory chips from four product lines, 1T-SRAM, MDRAM, MCACHE and SGRAM. Sales of our memory chips peaked at $36.3 million in 1998. We achieved profitability in the fourth quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. In the second quarter of 1998, unit prices and shipments into the personal computer market declined dramatically. At that time we decided that the combination of strong competition for personal computer memory chips, volatile pricing and low margins would limit the profitability of chip sales in the long run. Consequently, using elements of our existing memory technology as a foundation, we completed the development of our 1T-SRAM technology in the fourth quarter of 1998 and changed our primary focus to licensing this memory technology.             Also in 1998, we completed development of our first memory chips incorporating our 1T-SRAM technology and changed our marketing strategy for memory chips to focus on selling 1T-SRAM memory chips to customers in the communications equipment business. At the same time, we began to phase out our three other product lines. We ceased shipping MCACHE in early 1999. By the end of the second quarter of 2000, we had ceased production of MDRAM chips, which we presently sell in limited amounts from remaining inventory. We presently ship SGRAM chips in low volumes from remaining inventory only to support small orders from existing customers. Consequently, we anticipate that virtually all of our future product revenue will derive from sales of 1T-SRAM memory chips, which represented 91% of product revenue in 2001.    29        NAME="page_do1390_1_30">               After changing our business model, we signed our first license agreement related to 1T-SRAM technology at the end of the fourth quarter of 1998 and recognized licensing revenue from our 1T-SRAM technology for the first time in the first quarter of 2000. As of December 31, 2001, we had signed agreements related to our 1T-SRAM technology with 26 companies. Generally, we expect our total sales cycle, or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties from the licensee's use of our 1T-SRAM technology, to run from 18 to 24 months.            In July 2001, we completed the sale of a total of 5,750,000 shares of common stock at $10 per share in our initial public offering. We realized total net proceeds of approximately $51.6 million from the offering. We have had a limited operating history and incurred net losses in every year of operation until 1999.            We believe that quarterly and annual results of operations will be affected by a variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect revenue, gross profit and income from operations. Accordingly, and in light of our limited operating history under our new business model, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.            Revenue.     We generate three types of revenue: licensing, royalty and product revenue. Prior to 2001, almost all of our revenue was product revenue from the sale of memory chips. Since the beginning of 2001, product revenue as a percentage of total revenue has declined each quarter while the percentage of our license and royalty revenues has grown each quarter. In the third quarter of 2001, for the first time, combined license and royalty revenue exceeded product revenue. We anticipate this trend will continue in 2002. Currently, we anticipate further decline in product revenue in 2002 and increases in licensing and royalty revenues, which will represent an increasing proportion of our total revenue in 2002. Our future revenue results are subject to a number of factors, however, particularly those described in Part I., Item I, "BusinessRisk Factors".            Our licensing revenue consists of fees for providing circuit design, layout and design verification support to a licensee that is embedding our memory technology into its product. For some licensees, we also provide engineering support services to assist commencement of production of their products. We recognized licensing revenue for the first time in the first quarter of 2000. Licensing fees range from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars, depending on the scope and complexity of the development project, the licensee's rights and the royalty to be paid under the agreement. The licensee generally pays licensing fees in installments at the beginning of the license and upon achieving certain milestones. All contracts entered into to date require us to meet performance specifications. For contracts involving performance specifications that we have not met and we do not have the historical experience to reasonably estimate the costs, we defer the recognition of revenue until the licensee manufactures products that meet the contract performance specifications and recognize revenue using the completed contract method. However, if the contracts involve performance specifications that we have significant experience in meeting and the cost of contract can be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed using the percentage of completion method. Labor costs incurred are used as a measure of progress towards completion. Fees collected prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred contract revenue.            Each licensing agreement provides for royalty payments at a stated rate. We negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the amount of licensing fees to be paid, the anticipated volume of the licensee's sales of products that utilize our technology and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee when using our technology. Our agreements require licensees to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs. We generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report. We recorded our first royalty revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2000.    30                  We anticipate that licensing revenue will fluctuate from period to period and that it will be difficult to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue. Our license agreements involve long sales cycles, which make it difficult to predict the timing of signing agreements. These agreements are also associated with lengthy and complicated engineering development projects, and so the completion of development and commencement of production may be difficult for us to predict. We believe that the amount of licensing revenues for any period is not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.            The timing and level of royalties will likewise be difficult to predict because they are totally dependent on the licensees' ability to market, produce and ship product that incorporates our technology. Under our licensing business model, our future revenue will be tied to royalties on the production and sale of our licensees' products. Many of these products are consumer products, such as electronic games, for which demand is seasonal and generally highest in the fourth quarter, which we would report in the first quarter of the following year. For a discussion of factors that could contribute to the fluctuation of our revenues, please see Part I., Item 1,"BusinessRisk FactorsOur lengthy licensing cycle and our licensees' lengthy development cycles will make the operating results of our licensing business difficult to predict."            Product sales are typically on a purchase-order basis, with shipment of product from one to six months later. Provisions for estimated returns and to a lesser degree potential warranty liability are recorded at the time revenue is recognized.            Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd., or TSMC, manufactures all of the memory chips that we sell. Our products are assembled and tested prior to shipment by independent, third-party contractors. We contract for all of these manufacturing services on a purchase-order basis and have no long-term commitments for the supply of any of our memory chip products. If we are unable to obtain manufacturing, assembly or testing services required to fill our customer orders for these products, our revenues from these products will decline substantially.            Our memory chips are subject to competitive pricing pressure that might result in fluctuating gross profits, which we have experienced in the past. Prior to 1999, we sold most of our memory chips to the personal computer market, which is seasonal, and experienced the strongest demand for these products in the fourth quarter each year. From late 1998 to date, our memory chip sales have consisted primarily of 1T-SRAM chips sold to customers in the communications equipment business and we have not seen the effect of seasonal demand in the market.            The semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a difficult economic environment and downturn. Most of our memory chip sales are made to communications equipment manufacturers, which experienced a sharp economic downturn in 2001. We have limited visibility of our customer's chip requirements in 2002 and anticipate further declines in product revenue.             A few customers account for a significant percentage of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2001, our two largest customers, Cisco Systems, Inc. and NEC represented 21.7% and 18.6% of total revenue, respectively. In 2000, our largest customer was Cisco Systems, which represented 26.2% of our total revenue for the year. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue that year. In 1999, our two largest customers, ETMA Corporation and Maxtek Technology Company, Ltd., represented 16.4% and 10.9% of our total revenue, respectively. For information regarding revenues received by us in 2001, 2000 and 1999 from customers residing in the United States or residing in a foreign country, please refer to note 8, "Segment Information," of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.             Cost of Revenue.     Cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacture, assembly and testing of our memory chip products by independent, third-party contractors.    31                  Cost of licensing revenue consists primarily of engineering costs directly related to engineering development projects specified in agreements we have with licensees of our 1T-SRAM technology. These projects typically include customization of 1T-SRAM circuitry to enable embedding our memory on a licensee's integrated circuit and may include engineering support to assist in the commencement of production of a licensee's products. If licensing revenue is recognized using percentage of completion method, the associated cost of licensing revenue is recognized in the period the engineering expense is incurred. If licensing revenue is recognized using completed contract method and to the extent that the amount of engineering costs does not exceed the amount of the related licensing revenues, these costs are deferred on a contract-by-contract basis from the time we have established technological feasibility of the product to be developed under the license. Technological feasibility is established when we have completed all of the activities necessary to demonstrate that the licensee's product can be produced to meet the performance specifications when incorporating our technology. Deferred costs are charged to cost of licensing revenue when the related revenue is recognized. There are no reported costs associated with royalty revenue.            Research and Development.     Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee expenses, material costs for prototype and test units and expenses associated with engineering development software and equipment. Prior to 1998, our research and development expenses were incurred primarily in support of the design, development and production of memory chips.            Since changing our business model in 1998, we have devoted our research and development efforts primarily to developing the 1T-SRAM technology and related licensing activities. Some of these efforts have been directly related to projects specified in various license agreements we have with the early adopters of our memory technology. Research and development expenses can also include development and design of variations of the 1T-SRAM technology for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees and the development and testing of prototypes to prove the technical feasibility of embedding our memory designs in the licensees' products.            We generally record engineering cost as research and development expense in the period incurred, except when the engineering cost is being deferred under a licensing agreement for which technological feasibility has been established.            We intend to focus an increasing percentage of our research and development efforts on the development of new intellectual property for licensing to semiconductor companies, electronic product manufacturers and their customers. The success of our business will depend on our ability to develop these new technologies.            Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, occupancy costs, sales commissions to independent sales representatives and professional fees. We pay commissions to our independent sales representatives on most of our sales of memory chips. We leverage our licensing and co-marketing relationships to promote our technology. We have engaged one sales representative in Japan, who receives a commission on licensing revenue generated from licensees identified to us by the representative.    Lease Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Financing             The Company leases its corporate headquarters and is obligated to make future minimum lease payments of $818,000, $859,000, $902,000 and $462,000, in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 respectively. The Company has no off balance sheet financing.    32          Critical Accounting Policies             Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis we make these estimates based on our historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and reported results could differ under different assumptions or conditions.            We believe that our revenue recognition and inventory valuation accounting policies are affected by estimates and judgments in the following manner:            Revenue.     If a licensing contract involves performance specifications that we have significant experience in meeting, we recognize the revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed using the percentage of completion method. We follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to perform the contracted services. During the contract performance period we review estimates of cost to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the cost to complete. Our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income for the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known.            Inventory.     We state inventories at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out method, or market. Our policy is to write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to the extent the cost exceeds the estimated market value. We base the estimate on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed in our estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Our policy is to reflect any revaluation of inventory in reported income for the period in which the facts giving rise to the inventory revaluation become known.    33          Results of Operations             The table set forth below shows our results of operations for the past three years, expressed as a percentage of revenue.             Year ended  December 31,             2001     2000     1999       Net revenue:                            Product     57.8  %  89.9  %  100.0  %       Licensing.     26.9     10.0               Royalty     15.3     0.1                                      100.0     100.0     100.0        Cost of net revenue:                               Product     25.7     37.6     65.5          Licensing     2.8     3.6                                      28.5     41.2     65.5                           Gross profit     71.5     58.8     34.5                            Operating expenses:                               Research and development     19.7     23.2     20.3          Selling, general and administrative     20.8     24.6     15.5          Stock-based compensation charge     6.4     7.6     0.7                                 Total operating expenses     46.9     55.4     36.5                           Income (loss) from operations     24.6     3.4     (2.0  )    Interest and other income     8.1     8.0     3.4       Provision for income taxes     (1.6  )  (2.1  )  (0.4  )                        Net income     31.1  %  9.3  %  1.0  %                           Years Ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999             Revenue.     In 2001, total revenue increased 57% over the previous year to $22.5 million due to the strong growth of our licensing revenue, which increased to $6.1 million and our royalty revenue, which increased to $3.4 million. Most of the 2001 licensing and royalty revenue consisted of our engineering activities associated with NEC's development of chips for the Nintendo Gamecube video game console and royalties earned from the subsequent production of Gamecube chips incorporating our 1T-SRAM technology. Gamecube-related revenue represented 22.9% of total revenue in 2001. We also earned licensing revenue from a number of smaller development projects for other licensees, and royalty revenue from communication chips manufactured by Broadcom and Galileo. Revenue decreased from $15.4 million in 1999 to $14.3 million in 2000 primarily because sales of SGRAM memory chips declined substantially as we continued our phase-out of this product. The decline was largely offset in 2000 by a $6.1 million increase in the sale of 1T-SRAM memory chips and the recognition of our first 1T-SRAM technology licensing revenue, which totaled $1.4 million.            During the three-year period 2001, 2000 and 1999 product sales were $13.0 million, $12.9 million and $15.4 million, respectively. Sales of memory chips represented all our revenue in 1999 but declined to 89.9% of 2000 revenue and 57.8% of 2001 revenue as we shifted our primary focus from product sales to the licensing of our 1T-SRAM technology. Also during the same three-year period, sales of memory chips based on our 1T-SRAM technology were $11.8 million in 2001, $9.9 million in 2000 and $3.8 million in 1999. The increase in 1T-SRAM chip revenue occurred as we phased out the SGRAM    34           and MDRAM product lines and focused our product sales and marketing on manufacturers of communications equipment.             While product revenue increased slightly in 2001 compared to 2000, we have recorded significant declines in quarterly product revenue during 2001 because of the weakness in the communications equipment market, which is our primary market for memory chips. We expect additional declines in product revenue in 2002 and do not anticipate increases until there is a recovery in the communication equipment sector of the economy.            Gross Profit.     In 2001, gross profit increased to $16.1 million due to strong growth of licensing and royalty revenues, which contributed $8.9 million to gross profit for the year. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to 71.5% in 2001 due to the significantly higher proportion of licensing and royalty revenues, which have much higher gross profit margins than product revenues. In 2001, licensing gross profit as a percentage of licensing revenue was 90% and royalty gross profit as a percentage of royalty revenue was 100%. Gross profit increased from $5.3 million in 1999 to $8.4 million in 2000 primarily due to our decision to shift our focus to the sale of 1T-SRAM memory chips to communications equipment manufacturers. This resulted in lower unit shipments of memory chips but higher selling prices and gross margins than we had realized from sales of our other memory chip products. In addition, in 2000, we recognized licensing and royalty revenue for the first time, which contributed $933,000 to gross profit for the year. Also, gross profit increased as a percentage of revenue, growing from 34.5% in 1999 to 58.8% in 2000 mainly due to the higher proportion of the 1T-SRAM memory chip sales, which have had higher gross margins than the MDRAM and SGRAM memory chips that dominated sales in prior periods.            Research and Development.     In 2001, research and development expense increased to $4.4 million due to additions to the engineering staff, and expanded engineering support to our licensing activities. In addition, we established an engineering design center in Seoul, Korea in June 2001. Engineering expense incurred in 2001 and recorded as cost of license revenue was $597,000. Research and development expense increased to $3.3 million in 2000 from $3.1 million in 1999 as we added staff to support continued development of the 1T-SRAM technology and our expanding licensing activities. We recorded approximately $333,000 of engineering expense, incurred in 2000, as cost of license revenue.            Selling, General and Administrative.     In 2001, selling, general and administrative expense increased to $4.7 million. This increase reflected the addition of administrative, sales and marketing staff and the expansion of intellectual property marketing activities. Selling, general and administrative expense increased to $3.5 million in 2000 from $2.4 million in 1999 due primarily to expansion of our sales and marketing activities in selling memory chips and licensing our technology. In addition, our rent and facility expense increased with our July 2000 move into additional space in our existing headquarters building. Selling, general and administrative expense in 1999 included bad debt expense of $161,000. Of this amount, $143,000 was attributable to one customer that filed for bankruptcy            Interest Income and Interest Expense.     Interest income reflects interest earned on average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest income was $1.8 million, $1.2 million, and $520,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The fluctuation in interest income levels corresponds to differences in average cash balances for the periods and the interest rates, which declined significantly in 2001. In 2001, interest income increased due to higher average cash balances, which included proceeds from our July 2001 initial public offering, and was partially offset by a decline in interest rates. Interest income in 2000 was more than double that of 1999 due primarily to cash received from a preferred stock financing of $5.2 million in May 2000 and the receipt of $5.2 million of contract fee payments during 2000. We incurred no interest expense in 2001, 2000 or 1999.    35        NAME="page_dq1390_1_36">                Deferred stock-based compensation cost to employees.     During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company recorded deferred compensation of approximately $1.5 million, $2.4 million and $828,000, respectively.            Provision for Income Taxes.     Provisions for income taxes of approximately $367,000, $308,000 and $67,000 were recorded in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. At December 31, 2001, we had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $3,000,000 and approximately $2,000,000 for federal and state tax purposes, respectively, that we expect to be available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and applicable state income tax laws. Those net operating losses are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $774,000 pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Those net operating loss carry-forwards expire from 2002 to 2020. In 2002, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be less than the full corporate tax rate but higher than last year for financial reporting purposes.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             As of December 31, 2001, we had cash and cash equivalents of $47.4 million and short-term investments of $36.9 million. As of the same date, the Company had total working capital of $82.3 million. In July 2001, the Company completed the sale of a total of 5,750,000 shares of common stock in its initial public offering. The Company realized total net proceeds of approximately $51.6 million upon the close of the IPO. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs. We believe that our current focus on licensing and royalty revenues and reduced levels of memory chip sales has lessened the volatility of our business and generally have enabled us to steadily improve our cash position.            Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.4 million, $4.7 million and $3.6 million for the years ended 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. In 2001, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.4 million, which resulted principally from net profit of $7.0 million, a non-cash charge of $1.4 million for stock based compensation, reduction of accounts receivable of $1.3 million offset by $2.7 million decrease in deferred revenue. The reduction in deferred revenue in 2001 resulted from recognizing more licensing and pre-paid royalty revenues than additional license fees collected from our customers. In 2001, license fees of $5.0 million were received from our customers. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted principally from a net profit of $1.3 million and a non-cash charge of $1.1 million for stock based compensation. In addition, in 2000 we were paid license fees of $5.2 million, which were recorded as deferred revenue and which were partially offset by the recognition of $1.4 million of license revenue. Cash generated by operations in 2000 was offset by an inventory increase of $1.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in 1999 consisted of reductions of accounts receivable and inventory in the amounts of $1.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively. In addition, we collected $2.0 million in contract fees in 1999 and recorded them as deferred revenue. Cash generated from operations in 1999 was offset by the decline in accounts payable of $3.8 million, primarily because we reduced our inventory purchases.            Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $38.4 million, $659,000 and $726,000 for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Investing activities have consisted mainly of engineering design software purchases and the increase in 2001 resulted primarily from the establishment of our engineering design center in Korea. In addition, in 2001, we had activities in investing in short-term marketable securities of $36.9 million, net.            Net cash provided by financing activities were $54.0 million, $6.6 million and $65,000 in for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999. In 2001, we received total net proceeds of $51.6 million upon the close of our IPO in July. In addition, $2.0 million was received from the exercise of warrants and common stock options. In 2000, $5.2 million was received from the sale of redeemable convertible    36           preferred stock and $1.4 million was received from the exercise of common stock options and a warrant.            Our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter, depending on numerous factors, including       level and timing of licensing and memory chip sales revenues;  cost, timing and success of technology development efforts;  market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products;  competing technological and market developments;  cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights; and  variations in manufacturing yields, materials costs and other manufacturing risks.              We expect that the net proceeds of our initial public offering, together with our existing capital and cash generated from operations, if any, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We expect that a licensing business such as ours generally will require less cash to support operations after multiple licensees begin to ship products and pay royalties. However, we cannot be certain that we will not require additional financing at some point in time. Should our cash resources prove inadequate, we might need to raise additional funding through public or private financing. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. The failure to raise capital when needed could have a material, adverse effect on our business and financial condition.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"), "Business Combinations." SFAS 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method. To date, we have not had any business combination transactions.             In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which is effective for fiscal years beginning after March 15, 2001. SFAS 142 requires, among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization. In addition, the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles such as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles. We do not currently have goodwill or other intangible assets.             In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", which is required to be applied starting with years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS 144 requires, amongst other things, the application model for long-lived assets that are impaired or to be disposed of by sale. The adoption of SFAS 144 is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.    NAME="dq1390_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite03081">      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussion of Market Interest Rate Risk                  Our investment portfolio consists of money market funds, corporate-backed debt obligations and mortgage-backed government obligations generally due within one year. Our primary objective with its investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. These securities, which approximate $61,876,000 as of December 31, 2001, and have an average interest rate of approximately 2.95%, are subject to    37           interest rate risks. However, based on the investment portfolio contents and our ability to hold these investments until maturity, we believe that if a significant change in interest rates were to occur, it would not have a material effect on our financial condition.
