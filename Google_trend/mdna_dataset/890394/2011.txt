Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                   This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.    Overview             We design, develop, market and license differentiated embedded memory and high-speed parallel and serial interface, or I/O, intellectual property, or IP, for advanced Systems on Chips, or SoC, designs. 1T-SRAM is our high-density, high-performance patented memory solution that represents an alternative to traditional volatile embedded memory. Our I/O IP includes physical layer, or PHY, circuitry that allows integrated circuits to talk to each other or to discrete integrated circuits in the networking, storage, computer and consumer segments. Our PHYs support serial interface technologies, such as 10G Base KR, XAUI, PCI Express and SATA, as well as parallel interfaces like DDR3.            Our customers typically include fabless semiconductor companies, integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, and foundries. We generate revenue from the licensing of our IP, and our customers pay us fees for one or more of the following: licensing, non-recurring engineering services, royalties and maintenance and support. Royalty revenues are typically earned under our memory license agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate any of our memory technologies. Generally, we expect our total sales cycle, or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties, where applicable, from the licensee's use of our technologies, to run from 18 to 24 months. The portion of our sales cycle from the initial discussion to the receipt of license fees may run from 6 to 12 months, depending on the complexity of the proposed project and degree of development services required.            In February 2010, we announced a new product initiative to develop a family of integrated circuits products under the "Bandwidth Engine" product name. Our Bandwidth Engine family of ICs combines our 1T-SRAM high-density embedded memory with our high-speed 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) serial I/O technology and is initially being marketed to networking systems companies and designers of advanced SoC designs. Bandwidth Engine ICs have been designed to increase system performance by using a serial I/O to increase the accesses per second between the processor and memory component in networking systems. During 2010, we invested a significant amount of our financial and engineering resources towards the development of our Bandwidth Engine IC, and we expect to continue to do so in 2011. We began shipping samples of our first Bandwidth Engine IC to prospective customers in December 2010. We do not expect to generate meaningful revenue from our Bandwidth Engine ICs until 2012 or later.     Sources of Revenue             We generate two types of revenue: licensing and royalties.             Licensing.     Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services, prepaid pre-production royalties, and support and maintenance.            Our license agreements involve long sales cycles, which make it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed. In addition, our licensing revenue fluctuates from period to period, and it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter to quarter. Moreover, we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period.            Our licensing revenue consists primarily of fees for providing circuit design, layout and design verification and granting licenses to customers that embed our technology into their products. License fees generally range from $100,000 to several million dollars per contract, depending on the scope and    31             complexity of the development project, and the extent of the licensee's rights. The vast majority of our contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed. Fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.             Royalty.     Royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our memory licensing contracts that require our licensees to report royalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our memory IP. We recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report.            Royalty-bearing license agreements provide for royalty payments at a stated rate. We negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of the licensee's sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology. Our license agreements require the licensee to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs.            As with our licensing revenue, the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict. They depend on the licensee's ability to market, produce and sell products incorporating our technology. Many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are used in consumer products, such as electronic game consoles, for which demand can be seasonal.     Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates             Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.             We have identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies may involve estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from our estimates, and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.       Revenue Recognition      General               We generate revenue from the licensing of our IP, and customers pay fees for licensing, development services, royalties and maintenance and support. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of signed agreements. When sales arrangements contain multiple elements (e.g., license and services), we review each element to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement. If more than one unit of accounting exists, the consideration payable to us under the agreement is allocated to each unit of accounting using either the relative fair value method or the residual fair value method. Revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that unit of accounting.       Licensing               Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services and support and maintenance. For stand-alone license agreements or license deliverables in multi-element arrangements that do not require significant development, modification or customization, revenues are    32           recognized when all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Delivery of the licensed technology is typically the final revenue recognition criterion met, at which time revenue is recognized. If any of these criteria are not met, revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria have been met.            For license agreements that include deliverables requiring significant production, modification or customization, and where we have significant experience in meeting the design specifications involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. These judgmental elements include determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimating the total direct labor hours. We follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contract services. The direct labor hours for the development of the licensee's design are estimated at the beginning of the contract. As these direct labor hours are incurred, they are used as a measure of progress towards completion. We have the ability to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours on a contract-by-contract basis based on our experience in developing prior licensees' designs. During the contract performance period, we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete. Our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income or loss in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known. Under the percentage of completion method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined to be likely. If the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer, then the excess amount is recorded as an unbilled contracts receivable.            We provide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements. Under these arrangements, we provide unspecified upgrades, design rule changes and technical support. No other upgrades, products or other post-contract support are provided. Support and maintenance revenue is recognized at its fair value established by objective evidence, ratably over the period during which the obligation exists, typically 12 months. These arrangements are generally renewable annually by the customer.             Under limited circumstances, we also recognize prepaid pre-production royalties as license revenues. These are lump sum payments made when we enter into licensing agreements that cover future shipments of a product that is not commercially available from the licensee. We characterize such payments as license revenues because they are paid as part of the initial license fee and not with respect to products being produced by the licensee. These payments are non-cancelable and non-refundable.       Royalty               Our licensing contracts typically also provide for royalties based on licensees' use of our memory technology in their currently shipping commercial products. We generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report. Under limited circumstances, we may also recognize prepaid post-production royalties as revenue upon execution of the contract, which are paid in a lump sum after the licensee commences production of the royalty- bearing product and applied against future unit shipments regardless of the actual level of shipments by the licensee. The criteria for revenue recognition of prepaid royalties are that a formal agreement with the licensee is executed, no deliverables, development or support services related to prepaid royalties are required, the fees are non-refundable and not contingent upon future product shipments by the licensee, and the fees are    33           payable by the licensee in a time period consistent with our normal billing terms. If any of these criteria are not met, we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met.       Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments               We measure the fair value of financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:            Level 1Inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.      Level 2Pricing is provided by third party sources of market information obtained from investment advisors rather than models. We do not adjust for or apply any additional assumptions or estimates to the pricing information we receive from advisors. Our Level 2 securities include cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, which consisted primarily of certificates of deposit, corporate debt, and government agency and municipal debt securities from issuers with high quality credit ratings. Our investment advisors obtain pricing data from independent sources, such as Standard & Poor's, Bloomberg and Interactive Data Corporation, and rely on comparable pricing of other securities because the Level 2 securities we hold are not actively traded and have fewer observable transactions. We consider this the most reliable information available for the valuation of the securities.    Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment are used to measure fair value. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions. The determination of fair value for Level 3 investments and other financial instruments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity.     Valuation of long-lived Assets               We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when a triggering event is deemed to have occurred. This assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results, projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels. If our estimates and assumptions change in the future, it could result in a material write-down of long-lived assets. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology, patents and workforce, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to five years. We recognize an impairment charge as the difference between the net book value of such assets and the fair value of the assets on the measurement date.       Goodwill               We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We use a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the market approach. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired, and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference. We have determined that we have a single reporting unit for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment test. As we use the market approach to assess impairment, the price of our common stock price is an important component of the fair value calculation. If our stock price continues to experience    34           significant price and volume fluctuations, this will impact the fair value of the reporting unit, which can lead to potential impairment in future periods. As of December 31, 2010, we had not identified any factors to indicate there was an impairment of our goodwill and determined that no additional impairment analysis was required.       Deferred tax valuation allowance               When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets. The net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset.       Stock-based compensation               We recognize stock-based compensation for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, based on the grant-date fair value. We estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option- pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price.     Results of Operations        Net Revenue.                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2010      2009      2008      2009 to 2010      2008 to 2009              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Licensing     $  6,468     $  3,476     $  3,156     $  2,992        86  %  $  320        10  %      Percentage of total net revenue        42  %     30  %     23  %                                                      The $3.0 million increase in 2010 resulted primarily from increased licensing activity in the fourth quarter of 2009 involving license agreements that required significant customization. Consequently, revenue under those agreements was recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition accounting policies in 2010. We also signed a technology agreement with a major Japanese IDM customer in the second quarter of 2010, which contributed to the revenue growth.             Licensing revenue increased slightly in 2009 primarily because of revenue recognized under contracts we assumed in our acquisition of Prism Circuits. Revenue was recognized under the assumed contracts based on the fair value of the acquired fulfillment effort determined using estimated    35             engineering labor hours required to complete each project. This increase was partially offset by a decline in the number and value of license agreements for our 1T-SRAM technology licenses in 2009.                                                   Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2010      2009      2008      2009 to 2010      2008 to 2009              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Royalty     $  9,095     $  7,982     $  10,870     $  1,113        14  %  $  (2,888  )      (27  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        58  %     70  %     77  %                                                      Royalty revenue increased $1.1 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase in royalties received from TSMC, a major foundry partner, and a fabless semiconductor resulting from higher manufacturing volumes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in shipments by an IDM licensee whose product is used in the Nintendo Wii® game console, as well as decreased royalties received from licensees with products incorporating older generation technologies, such as 1.80 micron and 1.30 micron fabrication processes, which are approaching end of product life.             Royalty revenue decreased $2.9 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in royalties earned from a major foundry licensee as a result of a decrease in its shipments of ICs incorporating 1T-SRAM technology and from an IDM licensee that provides ICs for the Nintendo Wii® game console, which transitioned its manufacturing of those ICs to a more advanced processing node during the first half of 2009. Our license agreement with the IDM at the advanced processing node provides for royalty reporting in the quarter following the product shipments in contrast to the previous license agreement, which had been amended in 2006 to provide for reporting in the shipment quarter. The combination of these two factors resulted in a larger decline than would have occurred solely from the decline in game console shipments. The decrease was partially offset by royalties received from a major OEM customer, which commenced reporting and paying royalties in the third quarter of 2008.       Cost of Net Revenue and Gross Profit.                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2010      2009      2008      2009 to 2010      2008 to 2009              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Cost of net revenue     $  2,826     $  1,993     $  2,797     $  833        42  %  $  (804  )      (29  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        18  %     17  %     20  %                                                                                                 Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2010      2009      2008      2009 to 2010      2008 to 2009              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Gross profit     $  12,737     $  9,465     $  11,229     $  3,272        35  %  $  (1,764  )      (16  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        82  %     83  %     80  %                                                      Cost of net revenue consists of personnel costs for engineers assigned to revenue-generating licensing arrangements and related overhead allocation costs. Direct labor hours are tracked for each licensing arrangements and are used to measure the progress of completion.            The increase in cost of net revenue for 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in the number of licensing contracts requiring customization. Cost of net revenue in 2010 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million, which was consistent with the prior year. Total gross profit increased to $12.7 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase in license and royalty revenues. We expect that the cost of licensing revenue will grow in absolute dollars in the future because we anticipate entering into more license agreements on smaller process geometries, such as the 40nm and 28nm processes, which require more development effort. We expect cost as a percentage of total net revenue to increase, as well, from levels in 2010 and 2009.    36        NAME="page_dk49901_1_37">                                                          Cost of net revenue declined in 2009 primarily because we had fewer 1T-SRAM license agreements requiring significant engineering services. Cost of net revenue in 2009 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million, a decrease of $0.2 million compared with 2008. As a result of the lower cost of net revenue, our gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 83% of total revenue from 80% in 2008.       Research and Development.                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2010      2009      2008      2009 to 2010      2008 to 2009              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Research and development     $  25,534     $  19,255     $  17,206     $  6,279        33  %  $  2,049        12  %      Percentage of total net revenue        164  %     168  %     123  %                                                      Our research and development expenses include development and design of variations of our 1T-SRAM and I/O technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees, development of our 1T-Flash technology solution, costs related to the development of the Bandwidth Engine IC and amortization of technology-based intangible assets. In 2009 and 2008, we incurred costs of $0.4 million and $5.8 million, respectively, related to our former analog/mixed-signal product lines. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.             The $6.3 million increase in 2010 was primarily due to the following factors:       $3.7 million increase in our expanded engineering team working on our I/O and Bandwidth Engine products;      $2.0 million increase in costs related to the productization of our Bandwidth Engine IC, including mask tooling costs;       $1.3 million increase in amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets; and       $1.1 million increase in license costs for our CAD software tools; partially offset by       $0.9 million decrease in costs related to the analog/mixed-signal product lines resulting from the exit of these product lines in early 2009; and       $0.9 million decrease in other individually minor items.             The $2.1 million increase in 2009 resulted from a number of operational changes in 2008 and 2009, including the following:       $5.1 million increase in costs related to the operations acquired from Prism Circuits;       $1.2 million increase in costs related to acquisition-related contingent compensation charges;      $0.7 million increase in amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets; partially offset by a      $4.1 million decrease in costs related to the analog/mixed-signal product lines resulting from the exit of these product lines which was completed in the first quarter of 2009;       $0.6 million decrease in costs related to the closure of our facility in Korea in June 2009; and      $0.2 million decrease in other individually minor items.             Research and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Research and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in new    37             product development for our embedded memory and I/O technologies and development of our Bandwidth Engine IC products.       Selling, General and Administrative.                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2010      2009      2008      2009 to 2010      2008 to 2009              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Selling, general and administrative     $  10,391     $  9,507     $  12,006     $  884        9  %  $  (2,499  )      (21  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        67  %     83  %     86  %                                                      Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, application engineering, finance, human resources and general management.            The $0.9 million increase for 2010 was primarily due to the following factors:       $0.5 million increase in legal costs;       $0.3 million increase in marketing costs; and       $0.3 million increase in personnel-related costs; partially offset by       $0.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.             The $2.5 million decrease for 2009 was primarily due to the combination of the following factors:       $1.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense;       $0.7 million decrease in personnel-related costs, primarily due to headcount reductions; and      $0.3 million decrease in other individually minor items.             Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million, $1.7 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We expect total selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to an increase in sales and marketing efforts related to developing a sales channel for our Bandwidth Engine IC product line.       Impairment of Intangible Assets and Restructuring Charges.                                                    Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2010      2009      2008      2009 to 2010      2008 to 2009              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Impairment of intangible assets and restructuring charges             $  706     $  2,713     $  (706  )      (100  )%  $  (2,007  )      (74  )%      Percentage of total net revenue                6  %     19  %                                                      We did not incur any impairment or restructuring charges in 2010. We do not expect to incur additional restructuring charges related to the closure of the China, Romania and Korea offices and the remaining cash expenditures of $19,000 related to these closures are expected to be paid in the first half of 2011.            In the first quarter of 2009, we recorded $0.3 million in restructuring charges related to the closure of our China and Romania offices. In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded $0.3 million in restructuring charges resulting from the closure of our Seoul, Korea research and development office and elimination of its 15 positions. These charges were primarily related to employee terminations and costs to exit the leased facility there. Additionally, restructuring charges of $0.1 million were recorded in connection with the plan to exit the leased facility that had been occupied by Prism Circuits.    38              Other Income and Expense, net.                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2010      2009      2008      2009 to 2010      2008 to 2009              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Other income and expense, net     $  177     $  744     $  2,243     $  (567  )      (76  )%  $  (1,499  )      (67  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        1  %     6  %     16  %                                                      Other income and expense, net primarily consisted of interest income on our investments, which was $0.3 million, $0.9 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest income declined by $0.6 million in 2010 and $1.4 million in 2009 primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates earned.       Income Tax Provision (Benefit).                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2010      2009      2008      2009 to 2010      2008 to 2009              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Income tax provision (benefit)     $  51     $  (155  )  $  132     $  206        133  %  $  (287  )      (217  )%      Percentage of total net revenue                1  %     1  %                                                      Our income tax provisions were primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions. Our 2009 income tax benefit was primarily attributable to U.S. federal refundable tax credits.            As of December 31, 2010, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $62.3 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and approximately $61.3 million for state income tax purposes that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and state income tax laws. These net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2013 to 2030. In 2010, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federal statutory tax rate because of expected continued losses.            As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had net deferred tax assets of approximately $35.0 million and $25.6 million, respectively. Because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets, we had recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             As of December 31, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $37.5 million compared with a combined balance of $40.4 million at December 31, 2009. In December 2010, we sold approximately 5 million shares of common stock in a registered direct equity offering, raising approximately $20 million, net of transaction expenses of approximately $0.1 million. The offering was made under our existing $50 million shelf registration statement that became effective in November 2010. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital, including development of Bandwidth Engine ICs, and any acquisitions that we make that require cash consideration or expenditures.            In 2010, we used $15.6 million in operating activities, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $16.0 million, (after adjustment for non-cash charges consisting of stock-based compensation expense of $3.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.8 million), and $0.4 million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers, collection of receivables and payments to vendors.            In 2009, we used net cash of $11.7 million in operating activities. Primarily, that amount reflected the net effects of our net loss of $19.1 million, adjusted for $1.9 million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of the acquisition of Prism Circuits, non-cash charges, including    39             stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million, amortization of intangible assets of $1.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $0.9 million and a non-cash restructuring charge of $0.1 million. The changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers, collection of receivables and payments to vendors.            Cash used in operating activities was $8.6 million for 2008, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $18.6 million, which was partially offset by non-cash charges, including stock-based compensation expense of $4.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.5 million, an intangible asset impairment charge of $1.4 million, non-cash restructuring charges of $0.3 million and $2.1 million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities.            Our investing activities in 2010 included business acquisition payments of $7.9 million, of which $4.6 million related to a contingent payment related to the acquisition of Prism Circuits and $3.3 million related to the acquisition of MagnaLynx in the first quarter of 2010. In 2010, we purchased $1.4 million of fixed assets. Remaining investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketable securities.            Our investing activities in 2009 included a net payment of $13.6 million for the acquisition of Prism Circuits and $1.1 million for purchases of fixed assets during 2009.            In 2008, we spent approximately $0.5 million of expenditures for property and equipment. Otherwise, our investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketable securities and rolling over those investments.            Our cash from financing activities in 2010 consisted of the proceeds of our registered direct offering of common stock and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Cash used in financing activities in 2009 consisted of $0.9 million used for stock repurchases under our repurchase program prior to its suspension in February 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $0.8 million for 2008, which was primarily attributable to $1.0 million of cash expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2008 to repurchase approximately 275,000 shares of our own common stock under a repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors, partially offset by proceeds of $0.2 million from stock option exercises.            Our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter, depending on numerous factors, including:       level and timing of licensing, royalty and IC product revenue;       cost, timing and success of technology development efforts, including meeting customer design specifications;      fabrication costs, including mask costs, of our Bandwidth Engine ICs, currently under development;      variations in manufacturing yields, materials costs and other manufacturing risks;       costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations; and       profitability of our business.             Although we expect our cash expenditures to continue to exceed receipts in 2011 as we continue to expand research and development efforts for our 1T-SRAM and I/O technologies, the expansion and productization of the Bandwidth Engine product line, we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations, if any, to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Should our cash resources prove inadequate, we may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing, and have a shelf registration allowing us to sell up to $30 million of our securities from time to time prior    40             to the third anniversary of the effective date of that registration statement. We also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in our interests, including, but not limited to, from the sale of our debt and/or equity securities (before reductions for expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions) under our existing shelf registration statement. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. The failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.     Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments              The impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:                                             Payment Due by Period              Total      Less than 1 year      1-3 years      3-5 years      More than 5 years          Operating Leases     $  7,253     $  805     $  1,623     $  1,474     $  3,351         Purchase Commitments        5,231        2,289        2,942                         Capital Leases        327        181        146                                                                   $  12,811     $  3,275     $  4,711     $  1,474     $  3,351                                                           As of December 31, 2010, we had purchase commitments of $5.2 million for licenses related to computer-aided design tools payable through January 2013, and $0.3 million in capital lease obligations for testing equipment. In July 2010, we entered into a 10 year lease agreement for approximately 47,000 square feet with Mission West Properties, L.P.I for our new corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements             We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.     Indemnifications             In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter-party from losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties, a failure to perform certain covenants, or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. No material amounts are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for 2010, 2009 or 2008 related to these indemnifications.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements             See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.    41             NAME="dk49901_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">         Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk           Interest rate risk             We have exposure to interest rate risk due to our investment portfolio. Our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and meet liquidity needs. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agency debt, municipal notes, certificates of deposit, corporate notes and bonds, and money market funds. We place our investments with high-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund.             The investments, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Securities with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Securities with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Securities with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term investments. All investments have a maturity of less than two years. No single security should exceed 5% of the portfolio at the time of purchase. The portfolio dollar-weighted average maturity of these investments is within 12 months. These securities, which approximated $35.9 million as of December 31, 2010 and earned an average annual interest rate of approximately 0.9% in 2010, are subject to interest rate and credit risks. As of December 31, 2010, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/- 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately $0.1 million. We do not have any investments denominated in foreign currencies, and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments.     Foreign currency exchange rate risk             Currently, all of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains or losses to date. However, the expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in their local currencies, therefore we have risk of foreign exchange gains and losses through the funding of those expenditures. We do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. However, in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases, we may choose to hedge those exposures. For most currencies, we are a net payer of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies.
