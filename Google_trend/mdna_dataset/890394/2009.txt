Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                   This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.    Overview             We design, develop, market and license memory intellectual property, or IP, used by the semiconductor industry. Our patented memory solutions include 1T-SRAM and 1T-FLASH high-density alternatives to traditional volatile and non-volatile embedded memory. We license these technologies to companies that incorporate, or embed, memory on complex integrated circuits, such as Systems on Chips, or SoCs.             Our customers typically include fabless semiconductor companies, integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, and foundries. We generate revenue from the licensing of our IP, and our customers pay us fees for licensing, non-recurring engineering services, royalties and maintenance and support. Royalty revenues are typically earned under our license agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate any of our technologies. Generally, we expect our total sales cycle, or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties from the licensee's use of our technologies, to run from 18 to 24 months. The portion of our sales cycle from the initial discussion to the receipt of license fees may run from 6 to 12 months, depending on the complexity of the proposed project and degree of development services required.             In 2005, we began delivering our 1T-SRAM CLASSIC Memory Macro products to licensees. These macros are silicon-proven, pre-configured and high-density solutions offering customers rapid memory block integration into their SoC designs with minimal additional customization. We believe they will enable us to increase our penetration of the market for very dense, low power, high speed embedded memory applications.            In the third quarter of 2007, we acquired analog/mixed-signal integrated circuit designs, intellectual property, related assets and subsidiaries from Atmel Corporation, or Atmel, and LSI Design and Integration Corporation, or LDIC. In December 2008, we announced our plan to shut down these acquired assets and incur up to $1.8 million of exit costs.     Sources of Revenue             We generate two types of revenue: licensing and royalties.             Licensing.     Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services, prepaid pre-production royalties, and support and maintenance.            Our license agreements involve long sales cycles, which make it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed. In addition, our licensing revenues fluctuate from period-to-period, and it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter-to-quarter. Moreover, we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period.            Our licensing revenue consists primarily of fees for providing circuit design, layout and design verification and granting licenses to customers that embed our technology into their products. License fees generally range from $100,000 to several million dollars per contract, depending on the scope and complexity of the development project, and the extent of the licensee's rights. The licensee generally pays the license fees in installments at the beginning of the license term and upon the attainment of specified milestones. The vast majority of our contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed. Fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.    26                    Royalty.     Royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our licensing contracts that require our licensees to report royalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our technologies. We generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report.            Generally our license agreements provide for royalty payments at a stated rate. We negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of the licensee's sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology. Our license agreements generally require the licensee to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs.             As with our licensing revenue, the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict. They depend on the licensee's ability to market, produce and sell products incorporating our technology. Many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are used in consumer products, such as electronic game consoles, for which demand can be seasonal.     Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates             Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.            We have identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies may involve estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from our estimates, and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.       Revenue Recognition      General               We generate revenue from the licensing of our IP, and customers pay fees for licensing, development services, royalties and maintenance and support. We apply the principles of the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of signed agreements. When sales arrangements contain multiple elements (e.g., license and services), we apply the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-21 (EITF 00-21), "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables," to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement. If more than one unit of accounting exists, the consideration payable to us under the agreement is allocated to each unit of accounting using either the relative fair value method or residual method as prescribed by EITF 00-21. Revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria of SAB No. 104 have been met for that unit of accounting.       Licensing               For license agreements that do not require significant development, modification or customization, revenues are generally recognized when the criteria of SAB No. 104 have been met. If any of these criteria are not met, we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met.    27                   For license agreements that include deliverables that require significant production, modification or customization, we apply American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position 81-1 (SOP 81-1), "Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts." When we have significant experience in meeting the design specification involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. These judgmental elements include determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimation of the total direct labor hours. We follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contract services. The direct labor hours for the development of the licensee's design are estimated at the beginning of the contract. As these direct labor hours are incurred, they are used as a measure of progress towards completion. We have the ability to reasonably estimate direct labor hours on a contract-by-contract basis from our experience in developing prior licensee's designs. During the contract performance period, we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete. Our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known. Under the percentage of completion method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded loss accruals on two agreements for a total of $256,000. No loss accruals were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. If the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer, then we account for the excess amount as an unbilled contract receivable. Our total unbilled contract receivables were $428,000 and $518,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.            For contracts involving design specifications that we have not previously met or if inherent risks make estimates doubtful, the contract is accounted for under the completed contract method, and we defer the recognition of all revenue until the design meets the contractual design specifications. In this event, the cost of revenue is expensed as incurred. When we have experience in meeting design specifications, but believe that we do not have significant experience to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours related to services to meet a design specification, we defer both the recognition of revenue and the cost. We recognized $128,000 of revenue under the completed contract method in 2007. In 2008 and 2006, no revenue was recognized using the completed contract method.            We also provide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements. Under these arrangements, we provide unspecified upgrades, design rule changes and technical support. No other upgrades, products or other post-contract support are provided. We recognize support and maintenance revenue at its fair value established by objective evidence, ratably over the period during which the obligation exists, typically 12 months. These arrangements are renewable annually by the customer. Revenue from support and maintenance was $501,000, $484,000 and $287,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and was included in licensing revenue.            From time to time, a licensee may cancel a project during the development phase. Such a cancellation is not within our control and is often caused by changes in market conditions or the licensee's business. Cancellations of this nature are an aspect of our licensing business, and, in general, license contracts allow us to retain all payments that we have received or are entitled to collect for items and services provided before the cancellation occurs. Typically under our license agreements, the licensee is obligated to complete the project within a stated timeframe, including assisting us in completing the final milestone. If we perform the contracted services, the licensee is obligated to pay    28             the license fees even if the licensee fails to complete verification or cancels the project prior to completion. For accounting purposes we will consider a project to have been canceled even in the absence of specific notice from its licensee, if there has been no activity under the contract for six months or longer, and we believe that completion of the contract is unlikely. In this event, we recognize revenue in the amount of cash received, if we have performed a sufficient portion of the development services. If a cancelled contract had been entered into before the establishment of technological feasibility, the costs associated with the contract would have been expensed prior to the recognition of revenue. In that case, there would be no costs associated with that revenue recognition, and gross margin would increase for the corresponding period. No license revenue from cancelled contracts was recognized in 2008 and 2007. License revenue from cancelled contracts was $225,000 in 2006.            We also recognize pre-production prepaid royalties as license revenues. These are lump sum payments made when we enter into licensing agreements that cover future shipments of a product that is not commercially available from the licensee. We characterize such payments as license revenues because they are paid as part of the initial license fee and not with respect to products being produced by the licensee.       Royalty               Licensing contracts also provide for royalties based on licensees' use of our technology in their currently shipping commercial products. We generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report. We may also recognize revenue from post-production prepaid royalties, which are paid in a lump sum after the licensee commences production of the royalty-bearing product and applied against future unit shipments regardless of the actual level of shipments by the licensee. The criteria for revenue recognition of prepaid royalties are that a formal agreement with the licensee is executed, no deliverables, development or support services related to prepaid royalties are required, the fees are non-refundable and not contingent upon future product shipments by the licensee, and the fees are payable by the licensee in a time period consistent with the our normal billing terms. If any of these criteria are not met, we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met.       Fair Value Measurements               Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in money market accounts, auction-rate securities, corporate debt, commercial paper, government agency securities and municipal debt securities. In the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of the securities can be difficult and subjective. The volume of trading activity of certain securities has declined, and the rapid changes occurring in today's financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in the relatively short periods of time. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS No. 157) establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value.      Level 1Inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Therefore, determining fair value for Level 1 investments generally does not require significant judgment, and the estimation is not difficult.     Level 2Pricing is provided by third party sources of market information obtained through our investment advisors. We do not adjust for or apply any additional assumptions or estimates to the pricing information we receive from the advisors. For Level 2 securities, we base the fair value of our cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities on pricing from third party sources of market information obtained through our investment advisors rather than models. These cash equivalents     29              and available-for-sale securities consisted primarily of commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and government agency and municipal bonds from issuers with high quality credit ratings. Our investment advisors obtain pricing data from independent sources, such as Standard & Poor's, Bloomberg and Interactive Data Corporation, and rely on comparable pricing of other securities because the Level 2 securities we hold are not actively traded and have fewer observable transactions. We consider this the most reliable information available for the valuation of the securities.    Level 3Inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions. The determination of fair value for Level 3 investments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity.              All of our investments classified as Level 3 are auction-rate securities collaterized by student loans substantially guaranteed by the U.S. government. Since February 2008, there has not been a successful auction in that there were insufficient buyers for these auction-rate securities. Therefore, we transferred them from the Level 2 to Level 3 category as of March 31, 2008. In accordance with SFAS No. 157, we used the concept of fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows that included the following significant inputs and considerations:       projected interest income and principal payments through the expected holding period;       a market risk adjusted discount rate, which was based on actual securities traded in the open market that had similar collateral composition to the auction-rate securities as of December 31, 2008, adjusted for an expected yield premium to compensate for the current lack of liquidity resulting from failing auctions for such securities; and       no default or collateral value risk adjustments were considered for the discount rate, because all of the issuers were AAA-rated by nationally recognized rating agencies at December 31, 2008, and the auction-rate securities were collateralized by student loans, the repayments of which were substantially guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education.             In November 2008, we accepted an offer ("the right") from UBS Financial Services, Inc. (UBS) by which UBS will purchase the auction-rate securities from us, at our election, at par value at any time during the period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. Prior to June 30, 2010, UBS can redeem the securities at par value at its sole election. Additionally, the auction-rate securities are still subject to redemptions by the underlying issuers at any time. As a result of the right, we no longer have the intent to hold the securities until maturity and the purchase of the securities by UBS may occur before the markets for these securities recover. Therefore, we have changed the classification of the auction-rate securities to the trading securities category and reversed the unrecognized losses previously recorded in stockholders' equity. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a realized loss on investments of $1.6 million in the other income, net, line item in the consolidated statement of operations. However, as we can elect to have UBS purchase the auction-rate securities from us, we have accounted for the right as a separate freestanding financial asset measured at fair value, resulting in the recording of a long-term asset with an offsetting gain of approximately $1.6 million recorded in the Other income, net, line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We valued the right using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of, based on data available as of December 31, 2008, interest rates, timing and amount of cash flow, adjusted for any bearer risk associated with UBS's financial ability to repurchase the auction-rate securities beginning June 30, 2010. These assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change.    30                   On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115," which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. We did not elect the fair value option for our financial assets and liabilities existing on January 1, 2008, and did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets and liabilities transacted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, except for the right related to our auction-rate securities, which permits us to elect the fair value option for recognized financial assets, in order to match the changes in the fair value of the right. We will be required to assess the fair value of the right and auction-rate securities and record changes each period until the right is exercised or the auction-rate securities are redeemed. We will continue to classify the auction-rate securities as long-term investments until June 30, 2009, one year prior to the expected settlement.       Valuation of long-lived Assets               We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when a triggering event is deemed to have occurred. This assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results, projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels. If our estimates and assumptions change in the future, it could result in a material write-down of long-lived assets. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology, patents and workforce, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to five years. We recognize an impairment charge as the difference between the net book value of such assets and the fair value of the assets on the measurement date.       Goodwill               We review goodwill for impairment annually on September 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142 (SFAS No. 142), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The provisions of SFAS No. 142 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. For step one, we determine the fair value of its reporting unit using the market approach. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on the market value of the reporting unit at the entity level. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of net assets to the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We performed the annual impairment test during the third quarter of 2008, and the test did not indicate impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2008, we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill. If our stock price continues to experience significant price and volume fluctuations, this will impact the fair value of the reporting unit, which can lead to potential impairment in future periods.       Deferred tax valuation allowance               When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets. The net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely    31           than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2008, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $24.5 million, of which approximately $6.0 million was attributable to Canadian loss and research and development pool carryforwards, $15.1 million was attributable to U.S. and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and $3.4 million to other temporary differences.       Stock-based compensation               We account for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123R), "Share- Based Payment," and apply the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. We estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock price.     Results of Operations             The following discussion compares the historical results of operations based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.       Revenues.                                        Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2008      2007      2006      2007 to 2008      2006 to 2007              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Licensing     $  3,156     $  5,253     $  9,096     $  (2,097  )      (40  )%  $  (3,843  )      (42  )%      Percentage of total revenues        23  %     37  %     61  %                                                   The $2.1 million decrease in 2008 was primarily due to a decline in the value of license agreements for our 1T-SRAM licenses compared with 2007, although the total number of licensees increased in 2008. Specifically, we signed new licenses for our 1T-SRAM display driver interface application, which have lower license fees than our traditional 1T-SRAM.            The $3.8 million decrease in 2007 was primarily due to a significant decline in new customers and agreements for our CLASSIC Macro products and 1T-SRAM technology licenses. Licensing revenue from CLASSIC Macros declined primarily because in the fourth quarter of 2006, we entered into a royalty bearing technology license agreement with TSMC that allows them to develop and distribute 1T-SRAM macro designs for which TSMC pays us royalties when they ship integrated circuits to their customers.                                       Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2008      2007      2006      2007 to 2008      2006 to 2007              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Royalty     $  10,870     $  9,081     $  5,813     $  1,789        20  %  $  3,268        56  %      Percentage of total revenues        77  %     63  %     39  %                                                   Royalty revenue increased $1.8 million in 2008 primarily due to an increase in royalties earned on the sales of SoCs incorporating our technology by NEC for the Nintendo Wii game console, an increase in royalties received from a major foundry partner as production on the 65nm manufacturing    32             process increased, and royalties received from a major OEM customer that licenses our 1T-SRAM for advanced mobile phone applications. The increases were offset by decreased royalties received from licensees with products incorporating older generation technologies, such as products manufactured on the 180nm and 130nm processes.            Royalty revenue increased $3.3 million in 2007 primarily due to an increase in royalties earned on the sales of SoCs incorporating our technology by NEC for the Nintendo Wii game console which reached volume production in the last quarter of 2006.       Cost of Net Revenues and Gross Profit.                                        Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2008      2007      2006      2007 to 2008      2006 to 2007              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Cost of net revenue     $  2,800     $  2,737     $  1,498     $  63        2  %  $  1,239        83  %      Percentage of total revenues        20  %     19  %     10  %                                                   Cost of net revenues consists of personnel costs for engineers assigned to revenue-generating licensing arrangements and related overhead allocation costs.            The increase in cost of net revenues for 2008 was primarily due to licensing arrangements for our 1T-SRAM display driver interface application, which required the development of new macros for new foundry processes. Cost of revenue in 2008 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million, a decrease of $0.1 million over 2007. As a result of the increased engineering costs to fulfill our delivery obligations, our gross profit decreased from $11.6 million in 2007 to $11.2 million in 2008 and, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased slightly to 80% of total revenue in 2008 from 81% in 2007. We expect that cost of licensing revenues will continue to grow in absolute dollars because we anticipate entering into license agreements on smaller process geometries, such as the 45nm process and below, which require more development. As a percentage of revenue, we expect to maintain the levels reported in 2008 and 2007.            The increase in cost of net revenues for 2007 was primarily due to new licensing arrangements we entered into in 2007, which required significantly increased engineering services. Those contracts required us to develop new memory macros for smaller manufacturing process geometries, and we incurred higher costs to fulfill our obligations. Cost of revenue in 2007 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million, an increase of $0.3 million over 2006. As a result of the significant increase in engineering costs under new licensing arrangements, our gross profit decreased from $13.4 million in 2006 to $11.6 million in 2007 and, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased to 81% of total revenue in 2007 from 90% in 2006.

Stock-Based Compensation.               We recognized $4.6 million, $3.8 million and $2.7 million as stock-based compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The total compensation cost of options granted, but not yet vested, as of December 31, 2008 was $10.2 million, which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately 2.6 years.       Acquired In-Process Research and Development.                                        Year ended  December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2008      2007      2006      2007 to 2008      2006 to 2007              (dollar amounts in thousands)         In-process research and development     $       $  966     $       $  (966  )      (100  )%  $  966        100  %      Percentage of total revenues                7  %                                                           We recorded a charge of $1.0 million in 2007 for purchased in-process research and development expenses upon completion of the Atmel and LDIC asset acquisitions because technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. The fair value of the projects was determined by estimating the present value of the net cash flows we believed would result from the acquired technology.       Litigation Settlement.                                        Year ended  December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2008      2007      2006      2007 to 2008      2006 to 2007              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Litigation settlement     $       $       $  2,400     $               $  (2,400  )      (100  )%      Percentage of total revenues                        16  %                                                   In March 2004, UniRAM Technology, Inc. (UniRAM) filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement. In October 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with UniRAM under which we and UniRAM agreed to dismiss all outstanding claims and counterclaims with prejudice, and we paid UniRAM $2.4 million and received a complete release of all claims as well as a future fully    35             paid license for ourselves and all of our licensees with respect to UniRAM's relevant intellectual property.       Impairment of Intangible Assets and Restructuring Charges.                                        Year ended  December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2008      2007      2006      2007 to 2008      2006 to 2007              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Impairment of intangible assets and restructuring charges     $  2,713     $       $       $  2,713        100  %  $                   Percentage of total revenues        19  %                                                                   In the fourth quarter of 2008, our management approved and initiated a plan to exit the unprofitable analog/mixed-signal product lines, which we had acquired in 2007 through asset purchase agreements with Atmel and LDIC. In connection with these asset purchases, we had recorded intangible assets, which were being amortized over three to five years. As a result of the plan to exit these product lines, the intangible assets were considered to have no future value and deemed impaired, as no future cash flows will be generated. The remaining net book value, as of the date of management's announcement to exit the product lines, was written off.            This plan resulted in the elimination of approximately 90 employees, mainly located in our subsidiaries in China and Romania. The total costs in 2008 associated with the restructuring were $1.3 million, primarily related to accrued employee severance and the write-off of computer equipment and other assets. We expect to incur future additional restructuring charges related to this exit initiative in the range of $0.2 million to $0.5 million, primarily in the form of facility-related exit costs, in the first half of 2009. Total expected cash expenditures are expected to be $1.2 million, which will primarily be incurred in the first quarter of 2009. This product line exit is expected to result in approximately a $5.5 million reduction in annual operating expenses.       Other Income, net.                                        Year ended  December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2008      2007      2006      2007 to 2008      2006 to 2007              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Other income, net     $  2,243     $  4,520     $  3,286     $  (2,277  )      (50  )%  $  1,234        38  %      Percentage of total revenues        16  %     32  %     22  %                                                   Other income, net primarily consisted of interest income on our investments, which was $2.3 million, $4.5 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest income declined by $2.2 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates earned, as we transferred most of our cash into very high credit quality investments, such as money market funds that invest in securities of the U.S. government and its agencies and bear interest at lower rates. In addition, we had lower average investment balances during 2008 compared with 2007. The remaining decrease is primarily related to the impact of foreign exchange losses on balances denominated in foreign currencies.             We expect interest income to decline, as we expect to realize lower average interest rates on our portfolio in 2009 as we do not expect interest rates to increase significantly in 2009 from the levels they declined to in the fourth quarter of 2008.            The increase in other income, net for 2007 was primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and a $0.5 million decrease in other    36             expenses due to a non-recurring charge recorded in 2006 related to Japan withholding taxes paid by Japanese licensees on our behalf.       Provision for Income Taxes.                                        Year ended  December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2008      2007      2006      2007 to 2008      2006 to 2007              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Income tax provision     $  (132  )  $  (25  )  $  (109  )  $  (107  )     428  %  $  84         (77  )%      Percentage of total revenues        1  %             1  %                                                   Our income tax provisions were primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions.            As of December 31, 2008, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $27.0 million for federal income tax purposes, approximately $27.5 million for state income tax purposes and Canadian loss and research and development pool carryforwards of approximately $15.2 million that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal, Canadian and applicable state income tax laws. These net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2009 to 2028. In 2009, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federal statutory tax rate.            As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately $24.5 million and $17.4 million, respectively. Because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets, we had recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of $17.5 million, short-term investments of $26.6 million and long-term investments of $23.4 million, resulting in a combined balance of $67.5 million compared with a combined balance of $78.7 million at December 31, 2007. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital.            Cash used in operating activities was $8.5 million for 2008, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $18.4 million, which was partially offset by non-cash charges, including stock-based compensation expense of $4.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.5 million, an intangible asset impairment charge of $1.4 million, non-cash restructuring charges of $0.3 million and $2.1 million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities.             Cash used in operating activities was $1.1 million for 2007, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $8.5 million, and was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.4 million resulting from a decline in sales, increases in non-cash charges including the in-process research and development charge of $1.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of $3.8 million, $1.0 million for depreciation and amortization and $0.2 million of bad debt expense.            In 2008, we spent approximately $0.5 million of expenditures for property and equipment. In 2007, we spent approximately $1.0 million of expenditures for property and equipment and $1.5 million for the purchase of intangible and other assets from Atmel and LDIC in the third quarter of 2007. Otherwise, our investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketable securities and rolling over those investments.            Net cash used in financing activities was $0.8 million for 2008, which was primarily attributable to $1.0 million of cash expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2008 to repurchase approximately 275,000 shares of our own common stock under a repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors, partially offset by proceeds of $0.2 million from stock option exercises.    37                   Net cash used in financing activities was $2.1 million for 2007, which was primarily attributable to $5.1 million of cash expenditures during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 to repurchase approximately 883,000 shares of our own common stock under a repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors, partially offset by proceeds of $2.9 million from stock option exercises.             Our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter, depending on numerous factors, including:       level and timing of licensing and royalty revenues;       cost, timing and success of technology development efforts, including meeting customer design specifications;      market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products;       competing technological and market developments;       cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights;       variations in manufacturing yields, materials costs and other manufacturing risks;       costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations; and       profitability of our business.             Although we expect to continue to expend cash in 2009 as we continue to expand research and development efforts for our 1T-SRAM and 1T-FLASH technologies, we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations, if any, to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. As a result of our plan to exit the analog/mixed-signal product lines, we expect to incur cash expenditures of approximately $1.2 million primarily in the first quarter of 2009. In addition, in October 2008, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan. Since October 2008, we have spent approximately $1.9 million of our cash to repurchase shares under that plan. We cannot be certain, however, that we will not require additional financing at some point in time. Should our cash resources prove inadequate, we may need to raise additional funding through public or private financings. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. The failure to raise capital when needed could have a material, adverse effect on our business and financial condition.      Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments             The impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:                              Payment Due by Period              Total      Less than 1 year      1-3 years      More than 3 years          Operating Leases     $  1,052     $  575     $  477     $           Purchase Commitments        2,131        1,406        725                                                     $  3,183     $  1,981     $  1,202     $                                                    As of December 31, 2008, the Company had purchase commitments of $1.9 million for licenses related to computer-aided design tools payable through December 2010 and a $0.2 million purchase commitment for testing equipment.            Included above is approximately $0.3 million in future minimum lease payments attributable to a facility lease in China. In connection with our exit of the analog/mixed-signal product lines and related    38             closure of the China subsidiary, in January 2009 we were able to negotiate a cancellation of the lease and will not be liable for the remaining lease obligation.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements             We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.     Indemnifications             In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter-party from losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties, a failure to perform certain covenants, or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. No amounts are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for 2008, 2007 or 2006 related to these indemnifications.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements             See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.      NAME="dk16001_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">         Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk          Interest rate risk             We have exposure to interest rate risk due to our investment portfolio. Our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agencies, municipal notes, including auction-rate securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds. In general, money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. We do not use interest rate swaps in our investment portfolio. We place our investments with high-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund.            The investments (other than money market funds and auction-rate securities for which we have accepted the right to require their purchase by UBS and reclassified as trading securities) are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Securities with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Securities with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Securities with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term investments. All investments have a maturity of less than two years other than our auction-rate securities, discussed further below. No single security should exceed 5% of the portfolio at the time of purchase. These securities, which approximated $55.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and earned an average annual interest rate of approximately 3.0% in 2008, are subject to interest rate and credit risks. As of December 31, 2008, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/- 0.5% would result in changes in    39             fair market values for these investments of approximately $0.2 million. We do not have any investments denominated in foreign country currencies, and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments.            As of December 31, 2008, we held $7.5 million (net of $1.6 million in recognized losses) of investments, classified as long-term investments, with an auction reset feature (auction-rate securities) whose underlying assets were primarily in student loans. All of the issuers of our auction-rate securities had an AAA credit rating at December 31, 2008. Auctions for all of these auction-rate securities failed in early 2008, which means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not do so as a result of a lack of buying demand. As a result of auction failures, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction-rate securities was limited. In November 2008, we accepted an offer from UBS by which UBS will purchase the auction-rate securities from us, at our election, at par value at any time during the period from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012. In lieu of our making this election, the auction-rate securities will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the auction-rate securities if the auction process fails. UBS's obligations under the offer are not secured by its assets and do not require UBS to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the offer. UBS has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the offer. If UBS has insufficient funding to buy back the auction-rate securities and the auction process continues to fail, then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the auction-rate securities.     Foreign currency exchange rate risk             Currently, all of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains or losses to date. We do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. However, in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases, we may choose to hedge those exposures. For most currencies, we are a net payer of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies.
