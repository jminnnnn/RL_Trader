Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read inconjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.   Overview            Our strategy and primary business objective is to become a fabless semiconductor company focused on the development and sale ofintegrated circuits, or ICs, for the high-speed networking, communications, storage and computing markets. Our solutions deliver time-to-market, performance, power, area and economic benefits forsystem original equipmentmanufacturers, or OEMs. We have developed two families of ICs under the Bandwidth Engine® and LineSpeed product names. Bandwidth Engine ICs combine our proprietary1T-SRAM® high-density embedded memory, integrated macro functions and high-speed serial interface, or SerDes, I/O, with our intelligent access technology and a highly efficient interfaceprotocol. The LineSpeed IC product line, which was announced in March 2013, is comprised of non-memory, high-speed SerDes I/O devices with gearbox and retimer functionality, which convert lanes ofdata received on line cards or by optical modules into different configurations and/or ensure signal integrity. Certain SerDes products have been developed under a strategic development and marketingagreement with Credo Semiconductor Ltd., or Credo, to whom we have paid a total of $4.5 million for the development of these new products. The initial gross profits earned by us from thesale of Credo developed products will be primarily applied to reimbursing us for these development payments. Once $4.2 million of this amount has been reimbursed, all gross profits from thesale of the Credo-developed products worldwide will be shared equally by Credo and us.           Historically,our primary business was the design, development, marketing, sale and support of differentiated intellectual property, or IP, including embedded memory and high-speedparallel and SerDes I/O used in advanced systems-on-chips, or SoCs. Currently, we are focused on developing differentiated IP-rich IC products and are dedicating all our research and development,marketing and sales budget to these IC products.           Ourfuture success and ability to achieve and maintain profitability will be dependent on the marketing and sales of our IC products into networking, communications and other marketsrequiring high-bandwidth memory access. We are currently supporting existing design-win customers and actively pursuing additional design wins for the use of our ICs in networking and communicationequipment. To date, none of our design win customers have commenced full production of systems using our ICs. We have established initial pricing of our IC products ordered to date, but longer-termvolume prices will be subject to negotiations with our customers and may vary substantially from these initial prices.    Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates            Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ofAmerica. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidatedfinancial statements.           Wehave identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies may involve estimates andjudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from ourestimates, and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.   30          Revenue Recognition     General             We generate revenue from the sales of IC products and licensing of our IP. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of anarrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of signedagreements or customer purchase orders.     IC products             Products are sold both directly to customers, as well as through distributors. Revenue from sales directly to customers is generallyrecognized at the time of shipment. We may record an estimated allowance, at the time of shipment, for future returns and other charges against revenue consistent with the terms of sale. IC productrevenue and costs relating to sales made through distributors with rights of return or stock rotation are generally deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers due to ourinability to estimate future returns and credits to be issued. Distributors are generally able to return up to 10% of their purchases of slow, non-moving or obsolete inventory for credit every sixmonths. At the time of shipment to distributors, an accounts receivable for the selling price is recorded, as there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment, and inventory is relieved, aslegal title to the inventory is transferred upon shipment. Revenues are recognized upon receiving notification from the distributors that products have been sold to end customers. Distributors provideinformation regarding products and quantity, end customer shipments and remaining inventory on hand. The associated deferred margin is included in the accrued expenses and other line item in theconsolidated balance sheets.     Royalty             Royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our memory licensing agreements that require our licensees to reportroyalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our memory IP. Our license agreements require the licensee to report themanufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs. We recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive thelicensee's report. The timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict, and depend on the licensee's ability to market, produce and sell products incorporating our technology.     Licensing             Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services and support and maintenance. For stand-alonelicense agreements or license deliverables in multi-deliverable arrangements that do not require significant development, modification or customization, revenue is recognized when all revenuerecognition criteria have been met. Delivery of the licensed technology is typically the final revenue recognition criterion met, at which time revenue is recognized. If any of the criteria are notmet, revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria have been met. Support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the period during which the obligation exists, typically12 months.     Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments             We measure the fair value of financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniquesused to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:    Level 1Inputsused to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.    31         Level 2Pricingis provided by third party sources of market information obtained from investment advisors rather than models. We do not adjust for or apply any additionalassumptions or estimates to the pricing information we receive from advisors. Our Level 2 securities include cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, which consisted primarily ofcorporate debt, and government agency and municipal debt securities from issuers with high quality credit ratings. Our investment advisors obtain pricing data from independent sources, such asStandard & Poor's, Bloomberg and Interactive Data Corporation, and rely on comparable pricing of other securities because the Level 2 securities we hold are not actively traded and havefewer observable transactions. We consider this the most reliable information available for the valuation of the securities.   Level 3Unobservableinputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment are used to measure fair value. These valuesare generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions. The determination of fair value for Level 3 investmentsand other financial instruments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity.    Valuation of long-lived Assets             We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when a triggering event is deemed to haveoccurred. This assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results, projected cash flows and current period market capitalizationlevels. If our estimates and assumptions change in the future, it could result in a material write-down of long-lived assets. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets, such as developedtechnology and patent license, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years. We recognize an impairment charge as the difference between the net book value ofsuch assets and the fair value of the assets on the measurement date.     Goodwill             We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of anasset may not be recoverable. We firstassess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessaryto perform the two-step impairment test. If the qualitative assessment warrants further analysis, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of the reportingunit is determined using the market approach. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired, and no further testingis performed. If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference. We have determined that we have asingle reporting unit for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. We use the market approach to assess impairment in the second step of the analysis. We performed the annual impairmenttest in September 2014, and the test did not indicate impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2014, we did not identify any factors to indicate there was an impairment of our goodwill anddetermined that no additional impairment analysis was required.     Deferred tax valuation allowance             When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions wherewe conduct business. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accountingpurposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets. The net deferred tax   32        assetsare reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We must makesignificant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset.     Stock-based compensation             We recognize stock-based compensation for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, usually the vestingperiod, based on the grant-datefair value. We estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant usingan option- pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, theexpected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The expected term of options granted is derived from historical data onemployee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price.    Results of Operations      Net Revenue.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2014      2013      2012      2013 to 2014      2012 to 2013              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Product      $  2,280      $  394      $  90      $  1,886        479  %   $  304        338  %      Percentage of total net revenue        42  %     9  %     1  %                                                  Productrevenue increased in 2014 and 2013 due to increased volume of shipments for our ICs, mainly Bandwidth Engine, as we have more customers. In 2014, we realized $0.3 millionof revenue recognition from the reversal of sales return reserves recorded in prior periods following the completion of system-level tests in the field by customers, which reduced our expected risk ofreturns. We expect product revenue to increase in 2015 as our existing customers commence full production of their systems that utilize our ICs for which we have design wins. Furthermore, we expect toexpand our customer base.                                        Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2014      2013      2012      2013 to 2014      2012 to 2013              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Royalty and other      $  3,100      $  4,004      $  5,992      $  (904  )      (23  )%   $  (1,988  )      (33  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        58  %     91  %     99  %                                                  Royaltyand other revenue is primarily comprised of revenue generated from licensing agreements. The sequential decreases were primarily due to a decrease in shipment volumes bylicensees whose products incorporate our licensed IP and a decrease in revenue recognized from residual licensing agreements entered into in 2011 and prior years. We expect royalty and other revenueto decline in 2015, as we expect a decline in shipments of units incorporating our technology by licensees, as their products approach their end of life.   33          Cost of Net Revenue and Gross Profit.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2014      2013      2012      2013 to 2014      2012 to 2013              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Cost of net revenue      $  2,318      $  474      $  334      $  1,844        389  %   $  140        42  %      Percentage of total net revenue        43  %     11  %     5  %                                                                                  Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2014      2013      2012      2013 to 2014      2012 to 2013              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Gross profit      $  3,062      $  3,924      $  5,748      $  (862  )      (22  )%   $  (1,824  )      (32  )%      Gross margin        57  %     89  %     95  %                                                  In2014 and 2013, cost of net revenue was primarily comprised of direct and indirect costs related to the sale of IC products. In 2012, cost of net revenues primarily consisted ofpersonnel and related overhead allocation costs for engineers assigned to revenue-generating licensing arrangements.           Costof net revenue increased in 2014 and 2013, primarily due to the increase in product material and testing costs related to our IC shipments. We expect that the cost of net revenuewill increase in the future in absolute dollars, because we anticipate an increase in sales of our IC products.           Grossprofit decreased in 2014 and 2013, primarily due to the decrease in our royalty revenue, which has no associated costs, coupled with the increase in IC shipments. The deferredmargin recognized from the reversal of sales return reserves in 2014 was not material. Gross margin percentage decreased in 2014 and 2013, primarily due an increase in product revenue, which hasassociated costs, as compared to royalty revenue, which has no associated costs.     Research and Development.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2014      2013      2012      2013 to 2014      2012 to 2013              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Research and development      $  29,261      $  23,325      $  28,480      $  5,936        25  %   $  (5,155  )      (18  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        544  %     530  %     468  %                                                  Ourresearch and development expenses include costs related to the development of our IC products and amortization of intangible assets. We expense research and development costs as theyare incurred.           The$5.9 million increase in 2014 over the prior year was primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs, resulting from higher headcount, mask tooling costs,computer-aided software license fees and stock-based compensation charges.           The$5.2 million decrease in 2013 over the prior year was primarily due to decreases in our mask tooling costs, personnel-related costs resulting from lower headcount,computer-aided software license fees and lower amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets.           Researchand development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $3.4 million, $2.6 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31,2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our mask tooling costs and other fabrication costs are expected to be higher in2015 compared with 2014, as we continue to develop next generation products.   34                  Selling, General and Administrative.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2014      2013      2012      2013 to 2014      2012 to 2013              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Selling, general and administrative      $  6,519      $  6,161      $  8,218      $  358        6  %   $  (2,057  )      (25  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        121  %     140  %     135  %                                                  Selling,general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, finance, human resources and general management.           Selling,general and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million for 2014, compared with the prior year, as a result of increases in personnel-related and consulting costs.           The$2.1 million decrease for 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related and legal costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock- basedcompensation expense of $1.2 million, $1.1 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.           Weexpect total selling, general and administrative expenses to remain consistent in absolute dollars in 2015.     Gain on Sale of Assets.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2014      2013      2012      2013 to 2014      2012 to 2013              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Gain on sale of assets              $  630      $  3,291      $  (630  )      (100  )%   $  (2,661  )      (81  )%      Percentage of total net revenue                14  %     54  %                                                  InMarch 2012, we entered into an asset purchase agreement for an exclusive license of a portion of our intellectual property pertaining to our high- speed serial I/O technology forapproximately $4.3 million. As part of the agreement, we provided certain technology transfer support services, and 15 employees of our India subsidiary accepted employment with thepurchaser. In 2012, we received approximately $3.4 million in cash, less transaction costs, from this agreement, and received the final payment of $0.6 million in 2013.     Other Income, net.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2014      2013      2012      2013 to 2014      2012 to 2013              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Other income, net      $  143      $  209      $  155      $  (66  )      (32  )%   $  54        35  %      Percentage of total net revenue        3  %     5  %     3  %                                                  Otherincome, net primarily consisted of interest income on our investments, which was $0.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, partiallyoffset by other non-operating items.   35          Income Tax Provision.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2014      2013      2012      2013 to 2014      2012 to 2013              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Income tax provision      $  107      $  71      $  110      $  36        51  %   $  (39  )      (35  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        2  %     2  %     2  %                                                  Ourincome tax provisions were primarily attributable to taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and branches.           Asof December 31, 2014, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $133 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and approximately $98 million forstate income tax purposes that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and state income tax laws. These net operating loss carryforwards expire from2015 to 2034. In 2015, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federal statutory tax rate because of expected losses.           Asof December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had net deferred tax assets of approximately $67 million and $55 million, respectively. Because of uncertainties regarding therealization of these deferred tax assets, we had recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.    Liquidity and Capital Resources            As of December 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $25.8 million compared with a combinedbalance of $50.5 million at December 31, 2013. On March 4, 2015, we sold 14,375,000 shares of common stock in an equity offering made under our shelf registration statement andraised approximately $21.3 million, net of transaction expenses. After the transaction, our shelf registration statement remains available and allows us to sell up to approximately$27 million of our securities through September 2017. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital, including development of our IC products, and any acquisitions that we makethat require cash consideration or expenditures.           In2014, we used $26.3 million in operating activities, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $32.7 million, adjusted for non-cash charges and gains, which includedstock-based compensation expenses of $4.6 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.4 million and changes to operating assets and liabilities of $0.3 million. Thechanges in assets and liabilities primarily related to the payments to vendors, including purchases of inventory.           In2013, we used $22.6 million in operating activities, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $24.8 million, and $2.6 million used for operating assets andliabilities, adjusted for non-cash charges and gains, which included stock-based compensation expenses of $3.7 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.7 million. Thechanges in assets and liabilities primarily related to the recognition of revenue related to deferred revenues and payments to vendors.           In2012, we used $22.0 million in operating activities, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $27.6 million and the $3.3 million gain on the sale of assets,adjusted for non-cash charges consisting of stock-based compensation of $3.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $2.7 million and $2.4 million generated from changes inoperating assets and liabilities. The changes in assets and liabilities primarilyrelated to the timing of billing our customers, collection of receivables, recognition of revenue related to deferred revenues and payments to vendors.           Ourinvesting activities in 2014 primarily consisted of $0.6 million expended for purchases of fixed assets. Remaining investing activities consisted of investing our cash inmarketable securities, which did   36        notaffect our liquidity. Our investing activities in 2013 primarily consisted of $0.6 million received for the sale of assets and $0.2 million expended for purchases of fixed assets.Remaining investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketable securities, which did not affect our liquidity. Our investing activities in 2012 primarily consisted of $3.4 millionreceived, net of transaction costs, for the sale of assets and $0.7 million expended for purchases of fixed assets. Remaining investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketablesecurities, which did not affect our liquidity.           Ourfinancing activities in 2014 primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales under our employee stock purchase plan. Our financing activities in 2013primarily consisted of $27.7 million in net proceeds received from the sale of common stock though a public offering and $4.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options andpurchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. Our financing activities in 2012 primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales under our employee stockpurchase plan, partially offset by a repurchase and retirement of common stock.           Ourfuture liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter, depending on numerous factors, including:      level of revenue;     cost, timing and success of technology development efforts;     inventory levels, timing of product shipments and length of billing and collection cycles;       fabrication costs, including mask costs, of our ICs, currently under development;     variations in manufacturing yields, materials costs and other manufacturing risks;     costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations; and     profitability of our business.            Weexpect our cash expenditures to continue to exceed receipts in 2015, as our revenues will not be sufficient to offset our operating expenses, which include significant research anddevelopment expenditures for the expansion and fabrication of our IC products. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, along with our existing capital and cash generated fromoperations, if any, to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that our capital is sufficient to fund operations until such timeas we begin to achieve positive cash flows. We might decide to raise additional capital, and there can be no assurance that such funding will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Thefailure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.           Ifwe were to raise additional capital through sales of our equity securities, our stockholders would suffer dilution of their equity ownership. If we engage in debt financing, we may berequired to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, prohibit us from paying dividends, repurchasing our stock or making investments, and force us to maintain specifiedliquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be ableto, among other things:      develop or enhance our products;     continue to expand our product development and sales and marketing organizations;     acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;     expand operations, in the United States or internationally;     hire, train and retain employees; or    37            respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.            Ourfailure to do any of these things could seriously harm our ability to execute our business strategy and may force us to curtail our research and development plans or existingoperations.

Our investments are made in accordance with an investmentpolicy under the guidance of the audit committee of our board of directors. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and meet liquidity needs. To achieve thisobjective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including money market accounts, certificates of deposit, corporate debt,government-sponsored enterprise bonds and municipal bonds. We place our investments with high-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount ofcredit exposure with any one issuer or fund. The investments, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealizedgains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Securities with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.Securities with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Securities with remaining maturities greater thanone year are classified as long-term investments. All investments have a maturity of less than two years. No single security should exceed 5% of the portfolio or $2.0 million at the time ofpurchase. The portfolio's dollar- weighted average maturity of investments is within 12 months. These securities, which approximated $24.5 million as of December 31, 2014 andearned an average annual interest rate of approximately 0.3% in 2014, are subject to interest rate and credit risks. As of December 31, 2014, we performed a sensitivity analysis on ourinvestment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/ 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values for these investments ofapproximately $0.1 million. We do not have any investments denominated in foreign currencies, and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments.    Foreign currency exchange rate risk            Currently, all of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as a result, we have not experienced significant foreignexchange gains or losses to date. However, the expenses of our foreign entities are denominated in their local currencies, therefore we have risk of foreign exchange gains and losses through thefunding of those expenditures. We do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for tradingor speculative purposes. However, in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases, we may choose to hedge those exposures. For most currencies, we are a net payer of foreign currenciesand, therefore, benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies.
