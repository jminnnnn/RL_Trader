Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.    Overview             We design, develop, market and license memory intellectual property, or IP, used by the semiconductor industry. Our patented memory solutions include 1T-SRAM and 1T-FLASH high-density alternatives to traditional volatile and non-volatile embedded memory. We license these technologies to companies that incorporate, or embed, memory on complex integrated circuits, such as Systems on Chips, or SoCs. We have also sold memory chips based on our 1T-SRAM technologies, but we ceased actively selling them in 2004. We do not expect to make and sell memory chips in the future.            Our customers include semiconductor companies, IDMs, and foundries. We generate revenue from the licensing of our IP, and our customers pay us fees for licensing, non-recurring engineering services, royalties and maintenance and support. Royalty revenues are typically earned under our license agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate any of our technologies. Generally, we expect our total sales cycle, or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties from the licensee's use of our technologies, to run from 18 to 24 months. The portion of our sales cycle from the initial discussion to the receipt of license fees may run from six to 12 months, depending on the complexity of the proposed project and degree of development services required.            In 2005, we began delivering our 1T-SRAM CLASSIC Memory Macro products to licensees. These macros are silicon-proven, high-density solutions offering customers rapid memory block integration into their SoC designs. They are pre-configured and require minimal additional customization, and we believe they will enable us to increase our penetration of the market for very dense, low power, high speed embedded memory applications.            In July 2007, we entered into an asset purchase agreement and a transition services agreement with Atmel Corporation (Atmel) with respect to the purchase of several analog/mixed-signal integrated circuit designs and related assets from Atmel, including the rights to acquire an Atmel subsidiary located in Romania that employed 58 people and another Atmel subsidiary located in Shanghai, China that employed 45 people at the time of purchase. Under the agreement, we made a cash payment of $1.0 million, assumed net liabilities of acquired subsidiaries, and agreed to reimburse certain pre-closing operating expenses for a total purchase price of approximately $1.4 million.            In August 2007, we acquired intellectual property and other assets from LSI Design and Integration Corporation (LDIC) in a transaction related to the Atmel acquisition. We acquired this technology and related assets in exchange for 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock with the grant-date fair value of $7.07 per share. Of the 500,000 shares issued by us for the LDIC acquisition, $2.1 million (which represents the 300,000 shares valued at $7.07) has been recorded as intangible assets and the other 200,000 shares have been reserved for future distribution to employees and are being recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. We recorded the fair value of the 300,000 shares as part of the asset purchase consideration. In addition, the agreement calls for an earn-out payment equal to 25% of the license and royalty revenues generated by us from the integrated circuit designs acquired from Atmel and LDIC that are recognized in the first 12 calendar months following the closing date. Any such payments will be recorded as additional purchase consideration when earned.    27           Sources of Revenue             We generate two types of revenue: licensing and royalties.            Licensing.     Our license agreements involve long sales cycles, which makes it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed. In addition, our licensing revenues fluctuate from period-to-period, and it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter-to-quarter. Moreover, we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period. Our future revenue results are subject to a number of factors, particularly those described in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors."            Our licensing revenue consists of fees for providing circuit design, layout and design verification and granting a license to a customer for embedding our technology into its product. License fees generally range from $100,000 to several million dollars per contract, depending on the scope and complexity of the development project, and the extent of the licensee's rights. The licensee generally pays the license fees in installments at the beginning of the license term and upon the attainment of specified milestones. The vast majority of our contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed. Fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.            Royalty.     Each of our license agreements provides for royalty payments at a stated rate. We negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of the licensee's sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology. Our license agreements generally require the licensee to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs.            As with our licensing revenue, the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict. They depend on the licensee's ability to market, produce and sell products incorporating our technology. Many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are consumer products, such as electronic game consoles, for which demand can be seasonal and generally highest in the fourth quarter. For a discussion of factors that could contribute to the fluctuation of our revenues, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk FactorsOur lengthy licensing cycle and our licensees' lengthy product development cycle will make the operating results of our licensing business difficult to predict," and "Anything that negatively affects the businesses of our licensees could negatively impact our revenue."    Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates             Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.            We have identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies may involve estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from our estimates, and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.    28            Revenue Recognition      General               We generate revenue from the licensing of our IP, and customers pay fees for licensing, development services, royalties and maintenance and support. During 2004, we phased out sales of our proprietary memory chips and completed our final shipment of such products in early 2005. We apply the principles of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of agreements. When sales arrangements contain multiple elements (e.g., license and services), we apply the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-21 (EITF 00-21), "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables," to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement. If more than one unit of accounting exists, the agreement consideration payable to us is allocated to each unit of accounting using either the relative fair value method or the residual fair value method as prescribed by EITF 00-21. Revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria of SAB No. 104 have been met for that unit of accounting.       Licensing               Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services and support and maintenance. For license agreements that do not require significant development, modification or customization, revenues are generally recognized when the criteria of SAB No. 104 have been met. If any of these criteria are not met, we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met.            For license agreements that include deliverables that require significant production, modification or customization, we apply American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 81-1 (SOP 81-1), "Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts." When we have significant experience in meeting the design specification involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue over the period in which we perform the contract services. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method. The percentage of completion method includes judgmental elements, such as determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimation of the total direct labor hours. We follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contract services. The direct labor hours for the development of the licensee's design are estimated at the beginning of the contract. As these direct labor hours are incurred, they are used as a measure of progress towards completion. We have the ability to reasonably estimate direct labor hours on a contract-by-contract basis from our experience in developing prior licensee's designs. During the contract performance period, we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete. Our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known. Under the percentage of completion method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviation from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period. If the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer, then we account for the excess amount as an unbilled contract receivable. Our total unbilled    29           contract receivable was $518,000 and $360,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. If inherent risks make estimates doubtful, we must account for the contract under the completed contract method.            For contracts involving design specifications that we have not previously met, we defer the recognition of all revenue until the design meets the contractual design specifications and expense the cost of revenue as incurred. When we have experience in meeting design specifications, but believe that we do not have significant experience to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours related to services to meet a design specification, we defer both the recognition of revenue and the cost. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue using the completed contract method. We recognized $128,000 of revenue under the completed contract method in 2007. In 2006 and 2005, no revenue was recognized under the completed contract method.            We also provide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements. Under these arrangements, we provide unspecified upgrades, design rule changes and technical support. No other upgrades, products or other post-contract support are provided. We recognize support and maintenance revenue at its fair value established by objective evidence, ratably over the period during which the obligation exists, typically 12 months. These arrangements are renewable annually by the customer. Revenue from support and maintenance was $484,000, $287,000 and $512,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and was included in licensing revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.            From time to time, a licensee may cancel a project during the development phase. Such a cancellation is not within our control and is often caused by changes in market conditions or the licensee's business. Cancellations of this nature are an aspect of our licensing business, and, in general, license contracts allow us to retain all payments that we have received or are entitled to collect for items and services provided before the cancellation occurs. Typically under our license agreements, the licensee is obligated to complete the project within a stated timeframe, including assisting us in completing the final milestone, and if we perform the contracted services, is obligated to pay the license fees even if the licensee fails to complete verification or cancels the project prior to completion. For accounting purposes we will consider a project to have been canceled even in the absence of specific notice from its licensee, if there has been no activity under the contract for six months or longer, and we believe that completion of the contract is unlikely. In this event, we recognize revenue in the amount of cash received, if we have performed a sufficient portion of the development services. If a cancelled contract had been entered into before the establishment of technological feasibility, the costs associated with the contract would have been expensed prior to the recognition of revenue. In that case, there would be no costs associated with that revenue recognition, and gross margin would increase for the corresponding period. License revenue from cancelled contracts was $0, $225,000 and $240,000 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.       Royalty               Licensing contracts also provide for royalty reporting and payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our technologies after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs. We generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report. However, due to a contract amendment with one customer in the fourth quarter of 2006, we started to recognize royalty revenue for that customer in the same quarter in which the units are sold by this customer based on royalty reports received from the customer. In addition, in the first quarter of 2006, we began recognizing revenue from two types of prepaid royalties: pre-production royalties, which cover a fixed number of future unit shipments and are paid in a lump sum when we enter into the licensing contract, and post-production royalties, which are paid in a lump sum after the licensee commences production of the royalty-bearing product and applied against future unit shipments. In either case, these prepaid royalties are non-refundable. Revenue is recognized upon execution of the contract provided that no further performance obligations    30          exist. We record pre-production, prepaid royalties as license revenues and post-production, pre-paid royalties as royalty revenues.       Valuation of long-lived Assets               We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment, at least annually. This assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results, projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels. If our estimates and assumptions change in the future, it could result in a material write-down of long-lived assets. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology, patents and workforce, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to five years. We recognize an impairment charge as the difference between the net book value of such assets and the future undiscounted cash flows attributable the assets.       Deferred tax valuation allowance               When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets. The net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2007, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $17.4 million, of which approximately $5.8 million was attributable to Canadian loss and research and development pool carryforwards and $9.4 million was attributable to U.S. and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.            We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109," on January 1, 2007. FIN 48 is an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. Under FIN 48, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a "more likely than not" threshold. In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of other income and expense. This policy did not change as a result of our adoption of FIN 48.       Stock-based compensation               We account for stock compensation costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(revised 2004) (SFAS 123R), "Share-Based Payments," and apply the provisions of SAB No. 107. Upon adoption, we selected the modified prospective transition method, which requires us to recognize the fair value of the stock-based compensation in net income (loss) in the current and future periods and not to restate the impact of the adoption on the prior period financial statements. Upon adoption, we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the value of each employee stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model for the purpose of the pro forma financial disclosure in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (SFAS 123),    31          "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock price.    Results of Operations             The following discussion compares the historical results of operations based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.       Revenues.              Year ended December 31,     Year-Over-Year Change             2007     2006     2005     2006 to 2007     2005 to 2006             (dollar amounts in thousands)         Licensing     $  5,253     $  9,096     $  7,725     $  (3,843  )  (42  )%  $  1,371     18  %    Percentage of total revenues        37  %     61  %     63  %                                             Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services and support and maintenance.            The $3.8 million decrease in 2007 was primarily due to a significant decline in new customers and agreements for our CLASSIC Macro products and 1T-SRAM technology licenses. We believe that licensing revenue from CLASSIC Macros declined primarily because in the fourth quarter of 2006, we entered into a royalty bearing technology license agreement with TSMC that allows them to develop and distribute 1T-SRAM macro designs for which TSMC pays us royalties when they ship integrated circuits to their customers. We believe this arrangement with TSMC ultimately will be beneficial because a substantial percentage of potential licensees for our basic IT-SRAM technologies will use TSMC for foundry services.            Licensing revenue increased to $9.1 million in 2006 from $7.7 million in 2005 due to revenue recognized from several significant licensing contracts for our 1T-SRAM technology on the 90nm and 65nm manufacturing processes in 2006.             Year ended December 31,     Year-Over-Year Change             2007     2006     2005     2006 to 2007     2005 to 2006             (dollar amounts in thousands)         Royalty     $  9,081     $  5,813     $  4,547     $  3,268     56  %  $  1,266     28  %    Percentage of total revenues        63  %     39  %     37  %                                             Royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our licensing contracts that require our licensees to report royalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our technologies. We generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report.            Royalty revenue increased $3.3 million in 2007 primarily due to an increase in royalties earned on the sales of the Nintendo Wii game console which reached volume production in the last quarter of 2006.            Royalty revenue increased to $5.8 million in 2006 from $4.5 million in 2005 primarily due to a contract amendment with a customer, which allowed us to report royalty revenue one quarter earlier than the previous contract. As a result of this contract amendment, additional royalty revenue    32           representing 10% of total revenue was recognized in 2006, and in all subsequent future quarters, we will continue to recognize royalty revenue related to this amendment in the same quarter in which the units are sold. In 2006, the royalty earned from the production of Nintendo GAMECUBE chips decreased to 3% of total revenue, compared to 14% in 2005, as the GAMECUBE video game products approached the end of their product life cycles.       Cost of net revenues and gross profit.              Year ended December 31,     Year-Over-Year Change             2007     2006     2005     2006 to 2007     2005 to 2006             (dollar amounts in thousands)         Cost of net revenue     $  2,737     $  1,498     $  1,986     $  1,239     83  %  $  (488  )  (25  )%    Percentage of total revenues        19  %     10  %     16  %                                             Cost of net revenues consists of personnel costs for engineers assigned to revenue-generating licensing arrangements and related overhead allocation costs.            The increase in cost of net revenues for 2007 was primarily due to new licensing arrangements we entered into in 2007, which required significantly increased engineering services. Those contracts required us to develop new memory macros for smaller manufacturing process geometries, and we incurred higher costs to fulfill our obligations. Cost of revenue in 2007 includes stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million, an increase of $0.3 million over 2006. As a result of the significant increase in engineering costs under new licensing arrangements, our gross profit decreased from $13.4 million in 2006 to $11.6 million in 2007 and, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased to 81% of total revenue in 2007 from 90% in 2006. We expect that cost of licensing revenues will continue to grow in absolute dollars and will be higher as a percentage of net revenue for 2008 because we anticipate entering into license agreements requiring more complete development services due to the shift by many licensees to smaller process geometries, including 65nm and below.            Gross profit increased to $13.4 million in 2006 from $10.3 million in 2005 mainly due to an increase in our licensing revenue. Our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to 90% in 2006 from 84% in 2005 primarily due to a higher licensing gross profit, which increased to 84% of total licensing revenue in 2006 from 74% of total licensing revenue in 2005. This increase in licensing gross profit as a percentage of licensing revenue resulted from lower costs for fulfilling our obligations under large, high margin contracts and our CLASSIC Memory Macro projects. This cost reduction was partially offset by stock-based compensation expense of $225,000 recorded under SFAS 123(R). There was no stock-based compensation expense related to SFAS 123(R) in 2005. In addition, pre-production prepaid royalties included in licensing revenue contributed to an increased gross profit as a percentage of total revenue because such royalties have no associated cost.       Research and Development.              Year ended December 31,     Year-Over-Year Change             2007     2006     2005     2006 to 2007     2005 to 2006             (dollar amounts in thousands)         Research and development     $  11,988     $  8,156     $  5,839     $  3,832     47  %  $  2,317     40  %    Percentage of total revenues        84  %     55  %     48  %                                             Our research and development expenses include development and design of variations of the 1T-SRAM technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees, development of our 1T-FLASH technology solution and costs related to our newly acquired analog/mixed-signal design technology, including the subsidiaries in China and Romania, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.    33                  The $3.8 million increase in 2007 was primarily due to a substantial increase in newly hired personnel attributable to the Atmel and LDIC asset acquisitions in the third quarter of 2007 which added approximately one hundred employees. The increase included $0.5 million for contractually obligated bonuses and tape-out charges for our high definition DVD mixed-signal IP on a test integrated circuit, $0.4 million of amortization of purchased intangible assets from these acquisitions, and an increase of $0.2 million in stock-based compensation expense. In addition, we expanded our engineering team working on our non-volatile 1T-FLASH memory technology and 1T-SRAM display driver applications. Research and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million. We will increase our development efforts in 2008 to enable the commercial launch of our new IP technologies, and we expect total research and development expense to increase significantly in 2008 as compared to 2007, but to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues.            The increase in research and development expenses for 2006 from 2005 was primarily attributable to a lower allocation of expenses to cost of licensing revenue in 2006 because of the high margin contracts, which requires less customization and engineering efforts. Research and development expenses also increased as a result of the stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million under SFAS 123(R).       Selling, General and Administrative.              Year ended December 31,     Year-Over-Year Change             2007     2006     2005     2006 to 2007     2005 to 2006             (dollar amounts in thousands)         Selling, general and administrative     $  11,659     $  11,370     $  9,922     $  289     3  %  $  1,448     15  %    Percentage of total revenues        81  %     76  %     81  %                                             Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, customer support, finance, human resources and general management.            The increase for 2007 from 2006 resulted primarily from a $0.2 million increase in bad debt expense attributable to one customer, a $0.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, $0.3 million increase in legal fees related to employment matters, $0.4 million increase in salary and related costs, $0.2 million increase in marketing promotional activities and $0.2 million of separation costs related to the departures of two executives. These increases were offset by a $1.6 million decrease in litigation expenses.            The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 from 2005 was mainly due to stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million under SFAS 123(R). Expenses related to the UniRAM litigation in 2006 totaled approximately $1.7 million, compared to $1.6 million in 2005. Expenses related to testing and assessment of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act were approximately $411,000 in 2006.    34        NAME="page_dk16901_1_35">                     Stock-Based Compensation.               As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006, $3.8 million and $2.7 million were recognized as stock-based compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The total compensation cost of options granted, but not yet vested, as of December 31, 2007 was $10.6 million, which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately 2.55 years.            During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $36,000, which was attributable to the issuance of options to purchase our stock to newly appointed members of our board of directors that had an exercise price less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of the option grant, which was permitted under our option plan.            Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we amortized deferred compensation expense using the graded vesting method over the vesting period of each respective option, generally four years. The accelerated amortization resulted in expensing approximately 52% of the total award in the first year, 27% in the second year, 15% in the third year and 6% in the fourth year.       Acquired In-Process Research and Development.              Year ended December 31,     Year-Over-Year Change          2007     2006     2005     2006 to 2007     2005 to 2006          (dollar amounts in thousands)      In-process research and development     $  966     $       $       $  966     100  %  $           Percentage of total revenues        7  %                                                          We recorded a charge of $1.0 million in 2007 for purchased in-process research and development expenses upon completion of the Atmel and LDIC asset acquisitions because technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. The fair value of the projects was determined by estimating the present value of the net cash flows we believed would result from the acquired technology.       Litigation Settlement.              Year ended December 31,     Year-Over-Year Change             2007     2006     2005     2006 to 2007     2005 to 2006             (dollar amounts in thousands)         Litigation settlement     $       $  2,400     $       $  (2,400  )  (100  )%  $  2,400     100  %    Percentage of total revenues                16  %                                                     In March 2004, UniRAM Technology, Inc. (UniRAM) filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement. In October 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with UniRAM under which we and UniRAM agreed to dismiss all outstanding claims and counterclaims with prejudice, and we paid UniRAM $2.4 million and received a complete release of all claims as well as a future fully paid license for ourselves and all of our licensees with respect to UniRAM's relevant intellectual property.    35            Interest, Other Income and Expenses.              Year ended December 31,     Year-Over-Year Change             2007     2006     2005     2006 to 2007     2005 to 2006             (dollar amounts in thousands)         Interest, other income and expenses     $  4,520     $  3,286     $  2,591     $  1,234     38  %  $  695     27  %    Percentage of total revenues        32  %     22  %     21  %                                             The increase in interest, other income and expenses for 2007 was primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and a $0.5 million decrease in other expenses due to a non-recurring charge recorded in 2006 related to Japan withholding taxes paid by Japanese licensees on our behalf.            The increase in interest, other income and expenses for 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to higher interest rates but offset by a charge of $0.5 million recorded in 2006 related to Japan withholding taxes paid by Japanese licensees on our behalf. We do not expect any additional withholding tax reimbursement in the future as the U.S.Japan income tax treaty that took effect July 1, 2004 generally eliminated withholding taxes on royalties.       Provision for Income Taxes.              Year ended December 31,     Year-Over-Year Change             2007     2006     2005     2006 to 2007     2005 to 2006             (dollar amounts in thousands)         Income tax benefit (provision)     $  (25  )  $  (109  )  $  11     $  84     (77)%     $  (120  )  1,091  %    Percentage of total revenues        (0  )%     (1  )%     0  %                                             Our income tax provisions for 2007 and 2006 were primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions.            As of December 31, 2007, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14.7 million for federal income tax purposes, approximately $16.2 million for state income tax purposes and Canadian loss and research and development pool carryforwards of approximately $14.8 million that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal, Canadian and applicable state income tax laws. These net operating loss carryforwards expire over our tax periods from 2008 to 2027. In 2008, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federal statutory tax rate.            As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately $17.4 million and $13.8 million, respectively. Because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets, we had a full valuation allowance of $17.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and $12.5 million as of December 31, 2006.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             As of December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents of $37.7 million, short-term investments of $27.3 million and long-term investments of $13.7 million, resulting in a combined balance of $78.7 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11.1 million, short-term investments of $70.7 million and long-term investments of $2.5 million, resulting in a combined balance of $84.3 million. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs.            As discussed in more detail under Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," our short-term investments at December 31, 2007 included $11.6 million of adjustable rate securities that currently may be relatively illiquid. We believe we will be able to liquidate our adjustable rate securities without significant loss, and we currently believe these securities are not    36           impaired, primarily due to government guarantees of the underlying securities. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments' recorded value. We currently have the ability and intent to hold our $9.2 million of adjustable rate securities held as of February 29, 2008, until market stability is restored with respect to these securities. We believe that, even allowing for the reclassification of these securities to long-term and the possible requirement to hold all such securities for an indefinite period of time, our remaining cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs and to execute our current business plan.            Cash used in operating activities was $1.1 million for 2007 and primarily consisted of the net loss of $8.5 million, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.4 million, increases in non-cash charges including the in-process research and development charge of $1.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of $3.8 million, $1.0 million for depreciation and amortization and $0.2 million of bad debt expense.             Cash used in operating activities was $5.6 million for 2006 and primarily consisted of the net loss of $5.3 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $1.9 million, reduced deferred revenue of $0.7 million and decreased accrued expenses and other liabilities of $0.8 million, partially offset by the non-cash impacts of stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million and depreciation and amortization of $0.5 million.            Net cash provided by investing activities was $29.8 million for 2007 and was primarily attributable to $32.3 million of net proceeds from sales and purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by $1.0 million of expenditures for property and equipment and $1.5 million for the purchase of intangible and other assets from Atmel and LDIC in the third quarter of 2007.            Net cash provided by investing activities was $3.7 million for 2006, from sales of marketable securities of $3.9 million, partially offset by $0.2 million of purchases of property and equipment.            Net cash used in financing activities for 2007 was $2.1 million and was primarily attributable to $5.0 million of cash expenditures during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 to repurchase approximately 883,000 shares of our own common stock under a plan authorized by our Board of Directors in August 2007, partially offset by proceeds of $2.9 million from stock option exercises.            Net cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $3.8 million, which was attributable to proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options.            Our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter, depending on numerous factors, including:       level and timing of licensing and royalty revenues;  cost, timing and success of technology development efforts, including meeting customer design specifications;  market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products;  competing technological and market developments;  cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights;  variations in manufacturing yields, materials costs and other manufacturing risks;  costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations; and  profitability of our business.             We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations, if any, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the    37           foreseeable future. We expect that a licensing business such as ours generally will require less cash to support operations.            However, we cannot be certain that we will not require additional financing at some point in time. Should our cash resources prove inadequate, we may need to raise additional funding through public or private financing. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. The failure to raise capital when needed could have a material, adverse effect on our business and financial condition.    Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments             The impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:             Payment Due by Period          Total     Less than 1 year     1-3 years     Over 4 years    Operating Leases:                                           Obligations     $  1,542     $  825     $  717     $         Sublease Income        (35  )     (35  )                 Purchase Commitment        1,704        620        1,084                                       $  3,211     $  1,410     $  1,801     $                                      The purchase commitment relates to a three-year license agreement for computer-aided design tools payable in installments through December 2010.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements             We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.     Indemnifications             In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter-party from losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties, a failure to perform certain covenants, or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. No amounts are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007 or 2006 related to these indemnifications.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements             See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.             Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk          Interest rate risk             Our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our investment portfolio. Our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors. The primary objective of our    38           investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agencies, municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds. In general, money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. We do not use interest rate swaps in our investment portfolio. We place our investments with high-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund.            Our investment portfolio is classified as available-for-sale and is recorded at amortized cost. Securities with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term investments. Auction rate debt securities are classified as short-term investments because they have fixed reset dates within one year designed to allow investors to exit these investments at par even though the underlying municipal note may have an original maturity as much as 40 years. All investments have a maturity of less than two years. No single security should exceed 5% of the portfolio at the time of purchase. We do not have any investments denominated in foreign country currencies, and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments.            As of December 31, 2007, we held $11.6 million of municipal notes investments, classified as short-term investments, with an auction reset feature (adjustable rate securities) whose underlying assets were primarily in student loans and which had an AAA credit rating. During January 2008, we successfully liquidated $2.4 million of these adjustable rate securities and, as of February 29, 2008, we held $9.2 million of adjustable rate securities. Subsequently, auctions failed for all of these adjustable rate securities. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not do so as a result of a lack of buying demand. As a result of auction failures, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining adjustable rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist. These developments may result in the classification of some or all of these securities as long-term investments in our consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2008. If the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments.    Foreign currency exchange rate risk             Currently, all of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains or losses to date. We do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. However, in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases, we may choose to hedge those exposures. For most currencies, we are a net payer of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies.
