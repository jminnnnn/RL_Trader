Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read inconjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.   Overview            Our strategy and primary business objective is to become a fabless semiconductor company focused on the development and sale ofintegrated circuits, or ICs, for the high-speed networking, communications, storage and computing markets. Our technology delivers time-to-market, performance, power and economic benefits for systemoriginal equipmentmanufacturers, or OEMs. We have developed a family of ICs, called Bandwidth Engine®, which combines our proprietary 1T-SRAM® high-density embedded memory and high-speedserial interface, or SerDes, I/O, with our intelligent access technology and a highly efficient interface protocol. In March 2013, we announced another IC product line under the LineSpeedproduct name. LineSpeed ICs are non-memory, high-speed SerDes I/O devices with gearbox and retimer functionality, which convert lanes of data received on line cards into different configurationsand/or ensure signal integrity. Certain SerDes products have been developed under a strategic development and marketing agreement with Credo Semiconductor Ltd., or Credo. For those productsdeveloped by Credo, the first $2.3 million of gross profits generated by us from the sale of these products will be retained by us as reimbursement of the development costs. Thereafter, allgross profits from the sale of the Credo-developed products worldwide will be shared equally by Credo and us.           Historically,our primary business was the design, development, marketing, sale and support of differentiated intellectual property, or IP, including embedded memory and high-speedparallel and SerDes I/O used in advanced systems-on-chips, or SoCs. Since the beginning of 2010, we have invested an increasing amount of our research and development resources towards development ofour IC products. Our future success and ability to achieve and maintain profitability will be dependent on the manufacturing, marketing and sales of our IC products into networking, communications andother end-customer applications markets requiring high performance. During 2011, we began placing less emphasis on IP licensing and deploying more resources towards our IC product development andmarketing efforts. We have been focused on monetizing our IP portfolio to fund the change in our business. Towards this end, we have completed asset sales for proceeds of approximately$39.3 million, including our December 2011 patent sale and March 2012 SerDes technology sale. We are using the proceeds from these sales to partially fund our investment in our IC products. Westill maintain a large patent portfolio with over 100 patents granted and pending with more in process.           Revenuefrom IP licensing and royalties represented the majority of our revenues for 2011, 2012 and 2013. We have substantially completed our performance obligations under our existinglicense agreements, therefore we expect our licensing and royalty revenue to decrease in future periods. To date, we have not generated significant revenue from sales of our IC products. We arecurrently supporting existing design-win customers and actively pursuing additional design wins for the use of our ICs in networking and communication equipment. We have established initial pricing ofour IC products ordered to date, but longer-term volume prices will be subject to negotiations with our customers and may vary substantially from these initial prices.    Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates            Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ofAmerica. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidatedfinancial statements.   30                Wehave identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies may involve estimates andjudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from ourestimates, and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.     Revenue Recognition     Licensing             Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services and support and maintenance. The vast majorityof our contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed. Fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of anarrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of signedagreements. When sales arrangements contain multiple elements (e.g., license and services), we review each element to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement.If more than one unit of accounting exists, the consideration payable to us under the agreement is allocated to each unit of accounting using the relative fair value method. Revenue is recognized foreach unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that unit of accounting.           Forstand-alone license agreements or license deliverables in multi-deliverable arrangements that do not require significant development, modification or customization, revenue isrecognized when all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Delivery of the licensed technology is typically the final revenue recognition criterion met, at which time revenue is recognized. Ifany of the criteria are not met, revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria have been met.           Forlicense agreements that include deliverables requiring significant production, modification or customization, and where we have significant experience in meeting the designspecifications involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue over the period in which the contractservices are performed. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion ofprojects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. These judgmental elements include determining that we have the experience to meetthe design specifications and estimating the total direct labor hours. We follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contractservices. The direct labor hours for the development of the licensee's design are estimated at the beginning of the contract. As these direct labor hours are incurred, they are used as a measure ofprogress towards completion. We have the ability to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours on a contract-by-contract basis based on our experience in developing prior licensees' designs. Duringthe contract performance period, we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profitunder the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete. Our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income or loss in theperiod in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known. Under the percentage of completion method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period inwhich such losses are determined to be likely. If the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer, then the excessamount is recorded as an unbilled contracts receivable.   31                Weprovide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements. Under these arrangements, we provide unspecified upgrades, design rule changes and technical support. No otherupgrades, products or other post-contract support are provided. Support and maintenance revenue is recognized at its fair value established by vendor-specific objective evidence, ratably over theperiod during which the obligation exists, typically 12 months. These arrangements are generally renewable annually by the customer.     Royalty             Royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our memory licensing agreements that require our licensees to reportroyalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our memory IP. Our license agreements require the licensee to report themanufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs. We recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive thelicensee's report. As with our licensingrevenue, the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict. They depend on the licensee's ability to market, produce and sell products incorporating our technology.     IC products             Products are sold both directly to customers, as well as through distributors. Revenue from sales directly to customers is generallyrecognized at the time of shipment. We record an estimated allowance, at the time of shipment, for future returns and other charges against revenue consistent with the terms of sale. IC productrevenue and costs relating to sales made through distributors with rights of return or stock rotation are deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers due to our inability toestimate future returns and credits to be issued. Distributors are generally able to return up to 10% of their purchases of slow, non-moving or obsolete inventory for credit every six months. At thetime of shipment to distributors, an accounts receivable for the selling price is recorded, as there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment, and inventory is relieved, as legal title to theinventory is transferred upon shipment. Revenues are recognized upon receiving notification from the distributors that products have been sold to end customers. Distributors provide informationregarding products and quantity, end customer shipments and remaining inventory on hand. The associated deferred margin is included in the deferred revenue line item in the consolidated balancesheets. We recorded initial IC product revenue in 2012, and a significant reserve for returns has been recorded due to the product's early stage of development and testing. IC product revenue was notsignificant in 2012 and 2013, and has been included in the licensing and other revenue line item in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).     Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments             We measure the fair value of financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniquesused to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:    Level 1Inputsused to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   Level 2Pricingis provided by third party sources of market information obtained from investment advisors rather than models. We do not adjust for or apply any additionalassumptions or estimates to the pricing information we receive from advisors. Our Level 2 securities include cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, which consisted primarily ofcorporate debt, and government agency and municipal debt securities from issuers with high quality credit ratings. Ourinvestment advisors obtain pricing data from independent sources, such as Standard & Poor's, Bloomberg and Interactive Data Corporation, and rely on comparable pricing of other securities    32         becausethe Level 2 securities we hold are not actively traded and have fewer observable transactions. We consider this the most reliable information available for the valuation of thesecurities.   Level 3Unobservableinputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment are used to measure fair value. These valuesare generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions. The determination of fair value for Level 3 investmentsand other financial instruments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity.    Valuation of long-lived Assets             We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when a triggering event is deemed to haveoccurred. This assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results, projected cash flows and current period market capitalizationlevels. If our estimates and assumptions change in the future, it could result in a material write-down of long-lived assets. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets, such as developedtechnology, customer relationships and patent license, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years. We recognize an impairment charge as the difference betweenthe net book value of such assets and the fair value of the assets on the measurement date.     Goodwill             We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of anasset may not be recoverable. We firstassess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessaryto perform the two-step impairment test. If the qualitative assessment warrants further analysis, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of the reportingunit is determined using the market approach. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired, and no further testingis performed. If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference. We have determined that we have asingle reporting unit for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. We performed the annual impairment test in September 2013, and the test did not indicate impairment of goodwill. As ofDecember 31, 2013, we did not identify any factors to indicate there was an impairment of our goodwill and determined that no additional impairment analysis was required.     Deferred tax valuation allowance             When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions wherewe conduct business. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accountingpurposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets. The net deferred tax assets are reduced by avaluation allowance if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We must make significant judgments todetermine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset.   33          Stock-based compensation             We recognize stock-based compensation for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, usually the vestingperiod, based on the grant-date fair value. We estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of fair value of share-based paymentawards on the date of grant using an option- pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include,but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The expected term of options granted isderived from historical data onemployee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price.

The decrease in licensing revenue wasattributable to a lack of new licensing agreements during 2012 and 2013 and a decline in the value of residual fee-generating license agreements. License revenue recognized in 2013 was generated fromagreements entered into in 2011 and prior years. We expect our licensing revenue to decrease in 2014 as we have not executed any new IP licenses since 2011. However, we expect to offset the decreasein licensing revenue with increased sales of our IC products, which are included in this line item.           Licensingrevenue decreased $4.6 million in 2012 due to the lack of new license agreements and a decline in the number of residual fee-generating license agreements. Licenserevenue recognized in 2012 was generated solely from agreements entered into in 2011 and prior years.                                        Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2013      2012      2011      2012 to 2013      2011 to 2012              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Royalty     $  3,617     $  4,742     $  8,120     $  (1,125  )      (24  )%  $  (3,378  )      (42  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        82  %     78  %     58  %                                                  Royaltyrevenue decreased $1.1 million in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing volumes from a fabless semiconductor licensee and a decrease in shipments by an IDMlicensee whose product is used in the Nintendo Wii® game console, partially offset by increases in manufacturing volumes of other licensees. We expect royalty revenues to decrease in 2014as we expect a decline in shipments of units incorporating our technology by licensees, as their products approach their end of life, and we do not expect to receive any additional royalties relatedto the Nintendo Wii system.           Royaltyrevenue decreased $3.4 million in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in shipments by an IDM licensee whose product is used in the Nintendo Wii® game console andTSMC, a major foundry partner.   34          Cost of Net Revenue and Gross Profit.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2013      2012      2011      2012 to 2013      2011 to 2012              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Cost of net revenue     $  474     $  334     $  3,295     $  140        42  %  $  (2,961  )      (90  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        11  %     5  %     23  %                                                                                  Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2013      2012      2011      2012 to 2013      2011 to 2012              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Gross profit     $  3,924     $  5,748     $  10,812     $  (1,824  )      (32  )%  $  (5,064  )      (47  )%      Gross margin        89  %     95  %     77  %                                                  Costof net revenue consists of personnel and related overhead allocation costs for engineers assigned to revenue-generating licensing arrangements and direct and indirect costs relatedto the sale of IC products.           Costof net revenue increased in 2013, primarily due to increased IC cost of net revenue from sales of our Bandwidth Engine ICs, although we decreased costs incurred on engineeringservices on existing licensing contracts. We expect that the cost of revenue will increase in the future in absolute dollars, as well as a percentage of total net revenue, because we anticipate anincrease in sales of our IC products.           Costof net revenue decreased in 2012, primarily due to the lack of new licensing agreements and reduced requirements for engineering services on existing contracts. Cost of net revenuein 2012 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.1 million, a decrease of $0.3 million compared with 2011. Total gross profit decreased to $5.7 million in 2012 primarilydue to the decrease in license and royalty revenues.     Research and Development.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2013      2012      2011      2012 to 2013      2011 to 2012              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Research and development     $  23,325     $  28,480     $  26,216     $  (5,155  )      (18  )%  $  2,264        9  %      Percentage of total net revenue        530  %     468  %     186  %                                                  Ourresearch and development expenses include costs related to the development of our IC products and amortization of technology-based intangible assets. We expense research anddevelopment costs as they are incurred.           The$5.2 million decrease in 2013 was primarily due to decreases in our mask tooling costs, personnel-related costs resulting from lower headcount, computer-aided software toolscosts and lower amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets.           The$2.3 million increase in 2012 was primarily due to increases in our mask tooling and other fabrication costs and stock-based compensation charges, partially offset bydecreases in personnel-related costs resulting from lower headcount and lower amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets.           Researchand development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 million, $2.7 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31,2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our mask tooling costs and other fabrication costs are expected to be higher in2014 compared with 2013. The primary driver of research and development expense will be our continued investment in our current and next generation IC products.   35                     Selling, General and Administrative.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2013      2012      2011      2012 to 2013      2011 to 2012              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Selling, general and administrative     $  6,161     $  8,218     $  8,869     $  (2,057  )      (25  )%  $  (651  )      (7  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        140  %     135  %     63  %                                                  Selling,general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, finance, human resources and general management. The$2.1 million decrease for 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related and legal costs. The $0.7 million decrease for 2012 was primarily due to a decrease inpersonnel-related, legal and stock-based compensation costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million, $1.1 million and$1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.           Weexpect total selling, general and administrative expenses to slightly increase in absolute dollars in 2014 as we expand sales and marketing efforts for our IC products.

As part of the agreement, we provided certain technology transfer support services, and 15 employees of our India subsidiary accepted employment with the purchaser.In 2012, we received approximately $3.4 million in cash, less transaction costs, from this agreement, and received the final payment of $0.6 million in 2013.           InDecember 2011, we entered into a patent purchase agreement for the sale of 43 United States and 30 related foreign memory technology patents for $35.0 million in cash. Werecognized a $35.6 million gain on this transaction. The gain was comprised of the $35.0 million of proceeds, plus $0.8 million, which we determined to be the value of ourretained license to these patents, less transaction costs.

Interest income remained consistent in 2013 and 2012 due to consistent average investment balances and was lower by $0.1 million in 2011primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates earned.   36          Income Tax Provision.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2013      2012      2011      2012 to 2013      2011 to 2012              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Income tax provision     $  71     $  110     $  288     $  (39  )      (35  )%  $  (178  )      (62  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        2  %     2  %     2  %                                                  Our2013 and 2012 income tax provisions were primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions. Our 2011 income tax provision was attributable to the federal alternative minimum tax, as wewere profitable in 2011, and foreign jurisdictions.           Asof December 31, 2013, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $104 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and approximately $94 million forstate income tax purposes that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and state income tax laws. The federal net operating loss carryforwardsexpire from 2025 to 2033, and state net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2014 to 2033. In 2014, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federalstatutory tax rate because of expected losses.           Asof December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had net deferred tax assets of approximately $55 million and $44 million, respectively. Because of uncertainties regarding therealization of deferred tax assets, we had recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.    Liquidity and Capital Resources            As of December 31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $50.5 million compared with a combinedbalance of $40.7 million at December 31, 2012. In the second quarter of 2013, we sold approximately 7.5 million shares of common stock in an equity offering, raising approximately$27.7 million, net of transaction expenses. The offering was made under our shelf registration statement, which became effective in November 2010 and expired in November 2013. Our principalsource of cash in 2011 was the sale of patents for $35 million in December 2011. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital, including development of our IC products, and anyacquisitions that we make that require cash consideration or expenditures.           In2013, we used $22.6 million in operating activities, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $24.8 million, , and $2.6 million used for operating assets andliabilities, adjusted for non-cash charges and gains, which included stock-based compensation expenses of $3.7 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.7 million.

Remaininginvesting activities consisted of investing our cash in marketable securities, which did not affect our liquidity. Our investing activities in 2012 primarily consisted of $3.4 million received,net of transaction costs, for the sale of assets and $0.7 million expended for purchases of fixed assets. Remaining investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketablesecurities, which did not affect our liquidity. Our investing activities in 2011 included the payment of $1.5 million in deferred consideration for the MagnaLynx acquisition in 2010 and thepurchase of $0.3 million of fixed assets.           Ourfinancing activities in 2013 primarily consisted of $27.8 million in net proceeds received from the sale of common stock though a public offering and $4.2 million inproceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. Our financing activities in 2012 primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise ofstock options and sales under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by a repurchase and retirement of common stock. Our financing activities in 2011 primarily consisted of proceeds fromthe exercise of stock options and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.           Ourfuture liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter, depending on numerous factors, including:     level of revenue;    cost, timing and success of technology development efforts, including meeting customer design specifications;      fabrication costs, including mask costs of our ICs, currently under development;      variations in manufacturing yields, materials costs and other manufacturing risks;      costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations; and      profitability of our business.            Weexpect our cash expenditures to continue to exceed receipts in 2014, as our revenues will not be sufficient to offset our operating expenses, which include significant research anddevelopment expenditures for the expansion and fabrication of our IC products. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, along with our existing capital and cash generated fromoperations, if any, to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that we need to obtain additional capital prior to achieving positive operating cash flows.There can be no assurance that our capital is sufficient to fund operations until such time as we begin to achieve positive cash flows. We might decide to raise additional capital, and there can be noassurance that such funding will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. The failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and financialcondition.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk         Interest rate risk            We have exposure to interest rate risk due to our investment portfolio. Our investments are made in accordance with an investmentpolicy under the guidance of the audit committee of our board of directors. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and meet liquidity needs. To achieve thisobjective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agency debt, municipal notes, corporate notesand bonds, certificates of deposit, and money market funds. We place our investments with high-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund.           Theinvestments, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as aseparate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Securities with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Securities with original maturities greaterthan three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Securities with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-terminvestments. All investments have a maturity of less than two years. No single security should exceed 5% of the portfolio or $2.0 million at the time of purchase. The portfolio's dollar-weighted average maturity of investments is within 12 months. These securities, which approximated $46.1 million as of December 31, 2013 and earned an average annual interest rateof approximately 0.3% in 2013, are subject to interest rate and credit risks. As of December 31, 2013, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to ouranalysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/- 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately $0.2 million. We do not have anyinvestments denominated in foreign currencies, and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments.   39         Foreign currency exchange rate risk            Currently, all of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as a result, we have not experienced significant foreignexchange gains or losses to date. However, the expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in their local currencies, therefore we have risk of foreign exchange gains and losses through thefunding of those expenditures. We do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for tradingor speculative purposes. However, in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases, we may choose to hedge those exposures. For most currencies, we are a net payer of foreign currenciesand, therefore, benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies.
