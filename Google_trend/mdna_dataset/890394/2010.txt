Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                   This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.    Overview             We design, develop, market and license differentiated embedded memory and high-speed parallel and serial I/O intellectual property, or IP, for advanced Systems on Chips, or SoC, designs. Our patented memory solutions include 1T-SRAM and 1T-Flash high-density and/or high performance alternatives to traditional volatile and non-volatile embedded memory. Our I/O IP includes physical layer (PHY) circuitry that allows integrated circuits to talk to each other or to discrete memory devices like DDR3 in the networking, storage, computer and consumer segments. Our PHYs support serial interface technologies such as 10G Base KR, XAUI, PCI Express and SATA as well as parallel interfaces like DDR3.            Our customers typically include fabless semiconductor companies, integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, and foundries. We generate revenue from the licensing of our IP, and our customers pay us fees for one or more of the following: licensing, non-recurring engineering services, royalties and maintenance and support. Royalty revenues are typically earned under our memory license agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate any of our memory technologies. Generally, we expect our total sales cycle, or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties, where applicable, from the licensee's use of our technologies, to run from 18 to 24 months. The portion of our sales cycle from the initial discussion to the receipt of license fees may run from 6 to 12 months, depending on the complexity of the proposed project and degree of development services required.            In the third quarter of 2007, we acquired analog/mixed-signal integrated circuit designs, intellectual property, related assets and subsidiaries from Atmel and LDIC. In December 2008, as part of our initiative to exit unprofitable and non-core product lines, we announced our plan to cease all further work and sales activities on the acquired analog/mixed-signal products, closed our subsidiaries in China and Romania, and eliminated approximately 90 employees in the first half of 2009. We incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.3 million and $2.7 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to this product line exit.            In June 2009, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets and business of Prism Circuits, Inc. (Prism Circuits), a provider of high-speed parallel and serial I/O technology. The acquisition significantly expanded our product portfolio by adding high speed multi-protocol compliant interface technology, which enables communication between semiconductors in a system. We believe the integration of our patented memory IP and the newly acquired differentiated interface technology will allow us to provide a more comprehensive and competitive solution to our customers, especially in the networking and communications markets. With the acquisition, we added over 50 engineers experienced in interface technology development and analog/mixed-signal applications. We paid Prism Circuits $15.0 million in cash (reduced by approximately $1.4 million of cash we acquired) at closing and assumed certain of its liabilities as consideration for the acquired assets. We also agreed to pay up to an additional $6.5 million of cash as an earn-out payment shortly after the first anniversary of the closing date, contingent upon our achievement of certain objectives relating to the Prism Circuits business during that twelve-month period. To the extent earned, any earn-out payment will likely be paid in the third quarter of 2010. In addition, in June and July 2009, we granted options to purchase 3.6 million shares of our common stock to the newly hired Prism Circuits employees.    30            Sources of Revenue             We generate two types of revenue: licensing and royalties.             Licensing.     Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services, prepaid pre-production royalties, and support and maintenance.            Our license agreements involve long sales cycles, which make it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed. In addition, our licensing revenue fluctuates from period to period, and it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter to quarter. Moreover, we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period.            Our licensing revenue consists primarily of fees for providing circuit design, layout and design verification and granting licenses to customers that embed our technology into their products. License fees generally range from $100,000 to several million dollars per contract, depending on the scope and complexity of the development project, and the extent of the licensee's rights. The licensee generally pays the license fees in installments at the beginning of the license term and upon the attainment of specified milestones. The vast majority of our contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed. Fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.             Royalty.     Royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our memory licensing contracts that require our licensees to report royalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our memory IP. We generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report.            Royalty-bearing license agreements provide for royalty payments at a stated rate. We negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of the licensee's sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology. Our license agreements generally require the licensee to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs.            As with our licensing revenue, the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict. They depend on the licensee's ability to market, produce and sell products incorporating our technology. Many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are used in consumer products, such as electronic game consoles, for which demand can be seasonal.     Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates             Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.            We have identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies may involve estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from our estimates, and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.    31              Revenue Recognition      General               We generate revenue from the licensing of our IP, and customers pay fees for licensing, development services, royalties and maintenance and support. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of signed agreements. When sales arrangements contain multiple elements (e.g., license and services), we review each element to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement. If more than one unit of accounting exists, the consideration payable to us under the agreement is allocated to each unit of accounting using either the relative fair value method or the residual fair value method. Revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that unit of accounting.       Licensing               Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services and support and maintenance. For license agreements that do not require significant development, modification or customization, revenues are generally recognized when the revenue recognition criteria have been met. If any of these criteria are not met, revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria have been met.            For license agreements that include deliverables requiring significant production, modification or customization, and where we have significant experience in meeting the design specifications involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. These judgmental elements include determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimating the total direct labor hours. We follow this method because it can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contract services. The direct labor hours for the development of the licensee's design are estimated at the beginning of the contract. As these direct labor hours are incurred, they are used as a measure of progress towards completion. We have the ability to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours on a contract-by-contract basis based on our experience in developing prior licensees' designs. During the contract performance period, we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete. Our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known. Under the percentage of completion method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined to be likely. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a loss accrual of $24,000 for one agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded loss accruals on two agreements for a total of $256,000. No loss accruals were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007. If the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer, then the excess amount is recorded as an unbilled contracts receivable.             For contracts involving design specifications that we have not previously met or if inherent risks make estimates doubtful, the contract is accounted for under the completed contract method, and we defer the recognition of all revenue until the design meets the contractual design specifications. In this event, the cost of revenue is expensed as incurred. When we have experience in meeting design    32              specifications but do not have significant experience to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours related to services to meet a design specification, we defer both the recognition of revenue and the cost. No revenue was recognized under the completed contract method for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. We recognized $128,000 of revenue under the completed contract method in 2007.            We provide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements. Under these arrangements, we provide unspecified upgrades, design rule changes and technical support. No other upgrades, products or other post-contract support are provided. Support and maintenance revenue is recognized at its fair value established by objective evidence, ratably over the period during which the obligation exists, typically 12 months. These arrangements are generally renewable annually by the customer.            Under limited circumstances, we also recognize prepaid pre-production royalties as license revenues. These are lump sum payments made when we enter into licensing agreements that cover future shipments of a product that is not commercially available from the licensee. We characterize such payments as license revenues because they are paid as part of the initial license fee and not with respect to products being produced by the licensee. These payments are non-cancelable and non-refundable. No revenue from prepaid production royalties was recognized in 2009, 2008 and 2007.       Royalty               Our licensing contracts typically also provide for royalties based on licensees' use of our technology in their currently shipping commercial products. We generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report. Under limited circumstances, we may also recognize prepaid post-production royalties as revenue upon execution of the contract, which are paid in a lump sum after the licensee commences production of the royalty-bearing product and applied against future unit shipments regardless of the actual level of shipments by the licensee. The criteria for revenue recognition of prepaid royalties are that a formal agreement with the licensee is executed, no deliverables, development or support services related to prepaid royalties are required, the fees are non-refundable and not contingent upon future product shipments by the licensee, and the fees are payable by the licensee in a time period consistent with our normal billing terms. If any of these criteria are not met, we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met.       Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments               We measure the fair value of financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:      Level 1Inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.    Level 2Pricing is provided by third party sources of market information obtained from investment advisors rather than models. We do not adjust for or apply any additional assumptions or estimates to the pricing information we receive from advisors. Our Level 2 securities include cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, which consisted primarily of commercial paper, corporate debt, and government agency and municipal debt securities from issuers with high quality credit ratings. Our investment advisors obtain pricing data from independent sources, such as Standard & Poor's, Bloomberg and Interactive Data Corporation, and rely on comparable pricing of other securities because the Level 2 securities we hold are not actively traded and have fewer observable transactions. We consider this the most reliable information available for the valuation of the securities.     33             Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment are used to measure fair value. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions. The determination of fair value for Level 3 investments and other financial instruments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity.      Valuation of long-lived Assets               We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when a triggering event is deemed to have occurred. This assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results, projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels. If our estimates and assumptions change in the future, it could result in a material write-down of long-lived assets. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology, patents and workforce, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to three years. We recognize an impairment charge as the difference between the net book value of such assets and the fair value of the assets on the measurement date.       Goodwill               We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We use a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using the market approach. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference. We performed the annual impairment test during the third quarter of 2009, and the test did not indicate impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2009, we had not identified any factors to indicate there was an impairment of our goodwill. If our stock price continues to experience significant price and volume fluctuations, this will impact the fair value of the reporting unit, which can lead to potential impairment in future periods.       Deferred tax valuation allowance               When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets. The net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2009, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $25.6 million, of which $21.6 million was attributable to U.S. and state net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and $4.0 million to other temporary differences.    34              Stock-based compensation               We recognize stock-based compensation for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, based on the grant-date fair value. We estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option- pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price.     Results of Operations             In the fourth quarter of 2009, we identified a calculation error in the third-party software we use for stock administration. The calculation errors resulted in an understatement of previously reported non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the first three quarters of 2009, as well as 2008, 2007 and 2006, and changed the timing of stock-based compensation expense. The cumulative effects of this error on our net losses were determined to be immaterial to previously reported financial results. We have retroactively corrected the amount of such expenses and our net loss for 2008 and 2007 in the discussion below, which compares the historical results of operations based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Report).       Net Revenue.                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2009      2008      2007      2008 to 2009      2007 to 2008              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Licensing     $  3,476     $  3,156     $  5,253     $  320        10  %  $  (2,097  )      (40  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        30  %     23  %     37  %                                                      Licensing revenue increased slightly in 2009 primarily because of revenue recognized under contracts we assumed in our acquisition of Prism Circuits. Revenue was recognized under the assumed contracts based on the fair value of the acquired fulfillment effort determined using estimated engineering labor hours required to complete each project. This increase was partially offset by a decline in the number and value of license agreements for our 1T-SRAM technology licenses in 2009.             The $2.1 million decrease in 2008 was primarily due to a decline in the value of license agreements for our 1T-SRAM licenses compared with 2007, although the total number of licensees increased in 2008. Specifically, we signed five new licenses for our 1T-SRAM display driver interface application, which had lower license fees than our traditional 1T-SRAM.                                                   Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2009      2008      2007      2008 to 2009      2007 to 2008              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Royalty     $  7,982     $  10,870     $  9,081     $  (2,888  )      (27  )%  $  1,789        20  %      Percentage of total net revenue        70  %     77  %     63  %                                                      Royalty revenue decreased $2.9 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in royalties earned from a major foundry licensee as a result of a decrease in its shipments of ICs incorporating 1T-SRAM technology and from an IDM licensee that provides ICs for the Nintendo Wii® game console, which transitioned its manufacturing of those ICs to a more advanced processing node during the first half of    35             2009. Our license agreement with the IDM at the advanced processing node provides for royalty reporting in the quarter following the product shipments in contrast to the previous license agreement, which had been amended in 2006 to provide for reporting in the shipment quarter. The combination of these two factors resulted in a larger decline than would have occurred solely from the decline in game console shipments. The decrease was partially offset by royalties received from a major OEM customer, which commenced reporting and paying royalties in the third quarter of 2008.             Royalty revenue increased $1.8 million in 2008 primarily due to an increase in royalties earned on the sales of SoCs incorporating our technology by an IDM licensee for the Nintendo Wii game console, an increase in royalties received from a major foundry partner as production on the 65nm manufacturing process increased, and royalties received from a major OEM customer that licenses our 1T-SRAM for advanced mobile phone applications. The increases were offset by decreased royalties received from licensees with products incorporating older generation technologies, such as products manufactured on the 180nm and 130nm processes.       Cost of Net Revenue and Gross Profit.                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2009      2008      2007      2008 to 2009      2007 to 2008              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Cost of net revenue     $  1,993     $  2,797     $  2,744      $  (804  )      (29  )%  $  53        2  %      Percentage of total net revenue        17  %     20  %     19  %                                                      Cost of net revenue consists of personnel costs for engineers assigned to revenue-generating licensing arrangements and related overhead allocation costs.            Cost of net revenue declined in 2009 primarily because we had fewer 1T-SRAM license agreements requiring significant engineering services. Cost of net revenue in 2009 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million, a decrease of $0.2 million compared with 2008. As a result of the lower cost of net revenue, our gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 83% of total revenue from 80% in 2008. We expect that cost of licensing revenue will grow in absolute dollars in the future because we anticipate entering into more license agreements on smaller process geometries, such as the 40nm process, which require more development effort. We expect cost as a percentage of total net revenue to increase, as well, from levels in 2009 and 2008.            The increase in cost of net revenue for 2008 was primarily due to licensing arrangements for our 1T-SRAM for use in display driver applications, which required the development of new macros for new foundry processes. Cost of net revenue in 2008 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million, a decrease of $0.1 million compared with 2007. As a result of the increased engineering costs to fulfill our delivery obligations, our gross profit decreased from $11.6 million in 2007 to $11.2 million in 2008 and, as a percentage of total net revenue, decreased slightly to 80% of total net revenue in 2008 from 81% in 2007.       Research and Development.                                                    Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2009      2008      2007      2008 to 2009      2007 to 2008              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Research and development     $  19,255     $  17,206     $  12,203     $  2,049        12  %  $  5,003        41  %      Percentage of total net revenue        168  %     123  %     85  %                                                      Our research and development expenses include development and design of variations of our 1T-SRAM and I/O technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees, development of our 1T-Flash technology solution, costs related to the development of the Bandwidth    36              Engine IC and amortization of intangible assets. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred costs of $0.4 million, $5.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, related to our former analog/mixed-signal product lines. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.            The $2.0 million increase in 2009 resulted from a number of operational changes in 2008 and 2009, including the following:       $5.1 million increase in costs related to the operations acquired from Prism Circuits;       $1.2 million increase in costs related to acquisition-related contingent compensation charges;      $0.7 million increase in amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets; partially offset by a      $4.1 million decrease in costs related to the analog/mixed-signal product lines resulting from the exit of these product lines which was completed in the first quarter of 2009;       $0.6 million decrease in costs related to the closure of our facility in Korea in June 2009; and      $0.2 million less in foundry charges related to silicon validation of our designs due to the decline in engineering under license agreement.             The $5.0 million increase in 2008 was primarily due to the combination of the following factors:       $3.1 million increase, primarily personnel-related, attributable to the analog/mixed-signal product lines acquired at the beginning of the third quarter of 2007;       $0.8 million increase in costs attributable to the expansion of our engineering team working on our non-volatile 1T-Flash memory technology and 1T-SRAM display driver interface applications;       $0.7 million increase in foundry charges to complete validation of our designs in silicon;      $0.3 million increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets from the Atmel and LDIC acquisitions; and      $0.3 million increase in license costs for our CAD tools; offset by a       $0.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense; and       $0.1 million decrease in other individually minor items.             Research and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Research and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The calculation error affecting stock-based compensation resulted in increasing research and development expense by $38,000 and $215,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in new product development for our embedded memory and I/O technologies and development of the Bandwidth Engine.    37        NAME="page_dk14301_1_38">                                                 Selling, General and Administrative.                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2009      2008      2007      2008 to 2009      2007 to 2008              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Selling, general and administrative     $  9,507     $  12,006     $  12,011      $  (2,499  )      (21  )%   $  (5  )       %      Percentage of total net revenue        83  %     86  %     84  %                                                      Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, application engineering, finance, human resources and general management.            The $2.5 million decrease for 2009 was primarily due to the combination of the following factors:       $1.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense;       $0.7 million decrease in personnel-related costs, primarily due to headcount reductions;      $0.3 million decrease in marketing activities;       $0.2 million decrease in sales expenses and commissions;       $0.1 million decrease in other individually minor items; and       $0.3 million increase in acquisition transaction costs, primarily legal and accounting fees, related to the acquisition of Prism Circuits in the second quarter of 2009.             Expense for 2008, as corrected for the calculation error related to stock-based compensation, was approximately the same as 2007. Operational changes were as follows:       $0.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense;       $0.4 million expense reduction attributable to the 2008 reversal of bad debt expense recorded in 2007;      $0.3 million increase attributable to the hiring of additional personnel to expand our sales and marketing organizations to enhance our global presence and add analog/mixed-signal expertise;       $0.3 million reduction in legal costs;       $0.3 million reduction in personnel costs in the general and administrative function due to lower headcount; and      $0.1 million increase in individually minor items.             Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million, $3.1 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The calculation error affecting stock-based compensation resulted in increasing selling, general and administrative expense by $131,000 and $352,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect total selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to an increase in sales and field applications personnel and related costs, higher legal costs related to patent and trademark activity and marketing efforts related to the expected introduction of the Bandwidth Engine IC in late 2010.    38              Impairment of Intangible Assets and Restructuring Charges.                                                    Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2009      2008      2007      2008 to 2009      2007 to 2008              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Impairment of intangible assets and restructuring charges     $  706     $  2,713     $        $  (2,007  )      (74  )%  $  2,713        100  %      Percentage of total net revenue        6  %     19  %                                                              In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded $0.3 million in restructuring charges resulting from the closure of our Seoul, Korea research and development office and elimination of its 15 positions. These charges were primarily related to employee terminations and costs to exit the leased facility there. Additionally, restructuring charges of $0.2 million were recorded in connection with the plan to exit the leased facility that had been occupied by Prism Circuits.             In the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated a plan to exit the unprofitable analog/mixed-signal product lines, which we had acquired in 2007 through asset purchase agreements with Atmel and LDIC. In connection with these asset purchases, we had recorded intangible assets, which were being amortized over three to five years. As a result of the plan to exit these product lines, the remaining book value of these intangible assets of $1.4 million was considered to have no future value and deemed impaired, as no future cash flows would be generated. The remaining net book value, as of the date of management's announcement to exit the product lines, was written off. This plan resulted in the elimination of approximately 90 employees, mainly located in our subsidiaries in China and Romania. The total costs in 2008 associated with the restructuring were $1.3 million, primarily related to accrued employee severance and the write-off of computer equipment and other assets. In the first quarter of 2009, we incurred an additional $0.3 million related to this exit initiative, primarily in the form of facility-related exit costs.            We do not expect to incur additional restructuring charges related to the closure of the China, Romania and Korea offices and the remaining cash expenditures related to these closures are expected to be paid in the first half of 2010.       Other Income, net.                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2009      2008      2007      2008 to 2009      2007 to 2008              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Other income, net     $  744     $  2,243     $  4,520      $  (1,499  )      (67  )%   $  (2,277  )      (50  )%      Percentage of total net revenue        6  %     16  %     32  %                                                      Other income, net primarily consisted of interest income on our investments, which was $0.9 million, $2.3 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest income declined by $1.4 million in 2009 primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates earned, as we transferred most of our cash into higher credit quality investments, such as money market funds that invest in securities of the U.S. government and its agencies that paid interest at lower rates.    39              Income Tax Benefit (Provision).                                                      Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2009      2008      2007      2008 to 2009      2007 to 2008              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Income tax benefit (provision)     $  155      $  (132  )   $  (25  )  $  287        217  %   $  (107  )     428  %      Percentage of total net revenue        1  %     1  %                                                              Our income tax benefit was primarily attributable to federal tax credits. Our income tax provisions were primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions.            As of December 31, 2009, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $41.6 million for federal income tax purposes and approximately $39.4 million for state income tax purposes that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and state income tax laws. These net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2013 to 2029. In 2010, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federal statutory tax rate because of expected continued losses.            As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately $25.6 million and $24.8 million, respectively. Because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets, we had recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             As of December 31, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $40.4 million compared with a combined balance of $67.5 million at December 31, 2008. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital and any acquisitions that we make which require cash consideration or expenditures. Contingent upon meeting specified earn-out milestones, we are obligated to pay up to an additional $6.5 million of cash to Prism Circuits in 2010.            In 2009, we used net cash of $11.7 million in operating activities. Primarily, that amount reflected the net effects of our net loss of $19.1 million, adjusted for $1.9 million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of the acquisition of Prism Circuits, non-cash charges, including stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million, amortization of intangible assets of $1.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $0.9 million and a non-cash restructuring charge of $0.1 million. The changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers, collection of receivables and payments to vendors.            Cash used in operating activities was $8.6 million for 2008, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $18.6 million, which was partially offset by non-cash charges, including stock-based compensation expense of $4.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.5 million, an intangible asset impairment charge of $1.4 million, non-cash restructuring charges of $0.3 million and $2.1 million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities.             Our investing activities in 2009 included a net payment of $13.6 million for the acquisition of Prism Circuits and $1.1 million for purchases of fixed assets during 2009. In 2008, we spent approximately $0.5 million of expenditures for property and equipment. Otherwise, our investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketable securities and rolling over those investments.            Cash used in financing activities consisted of $0.9 million used for stock repurchases under our repurchase program prior to its suspension in February 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $0.8 million for 2008, which was primarily attributable to $1.0 million of cash expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2008 to repurchase approximately 275,000 shares of our own common stock under a    40           repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors, partially offset by proceeds of $0.2 million from stock option exercises.             Our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter, depending on numerous factors, including:       level and timing of licensing and royalty revenue;       cost, timing and success of technology development efforts, including meeting customer design specifications;      fabrication costs, including mask costs, of our Bandwidth Engine integrated circuits, currently under development;      market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products;       competing technological and market developments;       cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights;       variations in manufacturing yields, materials costs and other manufacturing risks;       costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations; and       profitability of our business.             Although we expect our cash expenditures to continue to exceed receipts in 2010 as we continue to expand research and development efforts for our 1T-SRAM and 1T-Flash technologies and the newly introduced Bandwidth Engine product line, we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations, if any, to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We cannot be certain, however, that we will not require additional financing at some point in time. Should our cash resources prove inadequate, we may need to raise additional funding through public or private financings. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. The failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.     Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments              The impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:                                          Payment Due by Period              Total      Less than 1 year      1-3 years      More than 3 years          Operating Leases     $  1,059     $  484     $  283     $  292         Purchase Commitments        2,422        1,102        1,320                 Capital Lease        248        91        157                                                     $  3,729     $  1,677     $  1,760     $  292                                                     As of December 31, 2009, the Company had purchase commitments of $2.4 million for licenses related to computer-aided design tools payable through January 2013 and a $0.2 million capital lease obligation for testing equipment.    41            Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements             We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.     Indemnifications             In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter-party from losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties, a failure to perform certain covenants, or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. No amounts are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for 2009, 2008 or 2007 related to these indemnifications.
