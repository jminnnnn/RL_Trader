Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read inconjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.   Overview            Our strategy and primary business objective is to become a fabless semiconductor company focused on the development and sale ofBandwidth Engine integrated circuits (ICs) to networking equipment systems providers and their subsystem and component vendors. Our Bandwidth Engine family of ICs combines our 1T-SRAMhigh-densityembedded memory and high-speed 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) serial interface (I/O) technology with our intelligent access technology and a highly efficient interface protocol and isinitially being marketed to networking systems companies. Bandwidth Engine ICs have been designed to increase system performance by using a serial I/O to increase the accesses per second between theprocessor and memory components in networking systems.           Sincethe beginning of 2010, we have invested an increasing amount of our financial and engineering resources towards the development of our Bandwidth Engine family of ICs. We shippedinitial samples of our first Bandwidth Engine ICs to prospective customers in December 2010, and, in November 2011, we announced two design wins for low volume applications. Our future success andability to achieve and maintain profitability will be dependent on our success in developing a market for our Bandwidth Engine ICs.           Historically,our primary business has been defining, designing, marketing and licensing differentiated embedded memory and high-speed parallel and serial interfaceintellectual property (IP) for advanced systems on chip (SoCs) designs. However, our competitiveness and the demand for our IP have declined since the beginning of 2011 as we have begun to dedicatemore of our engineering and marketing resources to our IC efforts. We expect that this trend will continue as we place more emphasis on IC product sales as opposed to our IP transactions.           The1T-SRAM is our high-density, high-performance patented memory solution that represents an alternative to traditional volatile embedded memory. OurI/O IP includes physical layer (PHY) circuitry that allows ICs to communicate with one another in the networking, storage, computer and consumer market segments. Our PHY IP supports serial interfacetechnologies, such as 10 Gbps Base KR, XAUI, PCI Express and SATA, as well as parallel interfaces like DDR3. Our IP customers typically include fabless semiconductor companies, integrated devicemanufacturers (IDMs) and foundries.           Asa result of our reduced licensing activities, we expect our licensing and royalty revenue to decrease in future periods. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from ourBandwidth Engine ICs until the second half of 2012 or later, and we believe that the growth in our IC revenues will not offset the decline in our IP revenues until at least 2013. Accordingly, weexpect our losses from operations to increase in the near future.    Sources of Revenue            We currently generate two types of IP revenue: licensing and royalties.            Licensing.     Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services, prepaid pre-production royalties,andsupport and maintenance. Our license agreements involve long sales cycles, which make it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed. In addition, our licensing revenue fluctuates fromperiod to period, and it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter to quarter. Moreover, we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period isnot necessarily indicative of results in any future period.   29                Ourlicensing revenue consists primarily of fees for providing circuit design, layout and design verification and granting licenses to customers that embed our technology into theirproducts. License fees generally range from $100,000 to several million dollars per contract, depending on the scope and complexity of the development project, and the extent of the licensee's rights.The vast majority of our contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed. Fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.            Royalty.     Royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our memory licensing contracts that require our licensees toreport royaltiesand make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our memory IP. We recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive thelicensee's report.           Royalty-bearinglicense agreements provide for royalty payments at a stated rate. We negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of thelicensee's sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology. Our license agreements require the licensee to report themanufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs.           Aswith our licensing revenue, the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict. They depend on the licensee's ability to market, produce and sell products incorporating ourtechnology. Many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are used in consumer products, such as electronic game consoles, for which demand can be seasonal.    Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates            Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ofAmerica. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidatedfinancial statements.           Wehave identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies may involve estimates andjudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from ourestimates, and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.     Revenue Recognition     General             We generate revenue from the licensing of our IP, and customers pay fees for licensing, development services, royalties and maintenanceand support. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonablyassured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of signed agreements. When sales arrangements contain multiple elements (e.g., license and services), we review each element to determinethe separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement. If more than one unit of accounting exists, the consideration payable to us under the agreement is allocated to each unit ofaccounting using the relative fair value method. Revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that unit of accounting.   30          Licensing             Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements, development services and support and maintenance. For stand-alonelicense agreements or license deliverables in multi-deliverable arrangements that do not require significant development, modification or customization, revenue is recognized when all revenuerecognition criteria have been met. Delivery of the licensed technology is typically the final revenue recognition criterion met, at which time revenue is recognized. If any of the criteria are notmet, revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria have been met.           Forlicense agreements that include deliverables requiring significant production, modification or customization, and where we have significant experience in meeting the designspecifications involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue over the period in which the contractservices are performed. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion ofprojects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. These judgmental elements include determining that we have the experience to meetthe design specifications and estimating the total direct labor hours. We follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contractservices. The direct labor hours for the development of the licensee's design are estimated at the beginning of the contract. As these direct labor hours are incurred, they are used as a measure ofprogress towards completion. We have the ability to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours on a contract-by-contract basis based on our experience in developing priorlicensees' designs. During the contract performance period, we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimatesof revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete. Our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate inreported income or loss in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known. Under the percentage of completion method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contractsare recorded in the period in which such losses are determined to be likely. If the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings toa customer, then the excess amount is recorded as an unbilled contracts receivable.           Weprovide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements. Under these arrangements, we provide unspecified upgrades, design rule changes and technical support. No otherupgrades, products or other post-contract support are provided. Support and maintenance revenue is recognized at its fair value established by vendor-specific objective evidence,ratably over the period during which the obligation exists, typically 12 months. These arrangements are generally renewable annually by the customer.           Underlimited circumstances, we also recognize prepaid pre-production royalties as license revenue. These are lump sum payments made when we enter into licensing agreementsthat cover future shipments of a product that is not commercially available from the licensee. We characterize such payments as license revenue because they are paid as part of the initial license feeand not with respect to products being produced by the licensee. These payments are non-cancelable and non-refundable.     Royalty             Our licensing contracts typically also provide for royalties based on licensees' use of our memory technology in their currentlyshipping commercial products. We recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee's report. Under limited circumstances, we may also recognize prepaid post-productionroyalties as revenue upon execution of the contract, which are paid in a lump sum   31        afterthe licensee commences production of the royalty- bearing product and applied against future unit shipments regardless of the actual level of shipments by the licensee. The criteria for revenuerecognition of prepaid royalties are that a formal agreement with the licensee is executed, no deliverables, development or support services related to prepaid royalties are required, the fees arenon-refundable and not contingent upon future product shipments by the licensee, and the fees are payable by the licensee in a time period consistent with our normal billing terms. If anyof these criteria are not met, we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met.     Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments             We measure the fair value of financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniquesused to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:    Level 1Inputsused to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   Level 2Pricingis provided by third party sources of market information obtained from investment advisors rather than models. We do not adjust for or apply any additionalassumptions or estimates to the pricing information we receive from advisors. Our Level 2 securities include cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, whichconsisted primarily of corporate debt, and government agency and municipal debt securities from issuers with high quality credit ratings. Our investment advisors obtain pricing data from independentsources, such as Standard & Poor's, Bloomberg and Interactive Data Corporation, and rely on comparable pricing of other securities because the Level 2 securities we hold are not activelytraded and have fewer observable transactions. We consider this the most reliable information available for the valuation of the securities.   Level 3Unobservableinputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment are used to measure fair value. These valuesare generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions. The determination of fair value for Level 3 investmentsand other financial instruments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity.    Valuation of long-lived Assets             We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when a triggering event is deemed tohave occurred. This assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results, projected cash flows and current period market capitalizationlevels. If our estimates and assumptions change in the future, it could result in a material write-down of long-lived assets. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets,such as developed technology, patent license and workforce, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to seven years. We recognize an impairment charge as thedifference between the net book value of such assets and the fair value of the assets on the measurement date.     Goodwill             We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of anasset may not be recoverable. We use a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of the reportingunit is determined using the market approach.If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired, and we are not required to perform further testing. If thecarrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reportingunit's goodwill and compare it to the   32        carryingvalue of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference.We have determined that we have a single reporting unit for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment test. As we use the market approach to assess impairment, the price of our common stock is animportant component of the fair value calculation. If our stock price continues to experience significant price and volume fluctuations, this will impact the fair value of the reporting unit, whichcan lead to potential impairment in future periods. As of December 31, 2011, we had not identified any factors to indicate there was an impairment of our goodwill and determined that noadditional impairment analysis was required.     Deferred tax valuation allowance             When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions wherewe conduct business. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accountingpurposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets. The net deferred tax assets are reduced by avaluation allowance if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We must make significant judgments todetermine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset.     Stock-based compensation             We recognize stock-based compensation for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, usuallythe vesting period, based on the grant-date fair value. We estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of fair valueof share-based payment awardson the date of grant using an option- pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, butare not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The expected term of options granted is derivedfrom historical data on employee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price.    Results of Operations      Net Revenue.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2011      2010      2009      2010 to 2011      2009 to 2010              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Licensing     $  5,987     $  6,468     $  3,476     $  (481  )      (7  )%  $  2,992        86  %      Percentage of total net revenue        42  %     42  %     30  %                                                  Licensingrevenue decreased $0.5 million in 2011 due to a decline in the number and value of new license agreements. Licensing revenue in 2011 included revenuerecognized from the achievement offinal milestones for two 1T-SRAM technology license agreements executed in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect our licensing revenue to decrease in 2012 as we will not be pursuing new IPlicenses, and the Company's sales and marketing personnel will be focusing on selling Bandwidth Engine ICs.           The$3.0 million increase in licensing revenue in 2010 compared with 2009 resulted primarily from increased licensing activity in the fourth quarter of 2009 involving licenseagreements that required significant customization. Consequently, revenue under those agreements was recognized in 2010 in   33        accordancewith our revenue recognition accounting policies. We also signed a technology agreement with a major Japanese IDM customer in the second quarter of 2010, which contributed to the revenuegrowth.                                        Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2011      2010      2009      2010 to 2011      2009 to 2010              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Royalty     $  8,120     $  9,095     $  7,982     $  (975  )      (11  )%  $  1,113        14  %      Percentage of total net revenue        58  %     58  %     70  %                                                  Royaltyrevenue decreased $1.0 million in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in shipments by an IDM licensee whose product is used in the Nintendo Wii®game console, although we didexperience an increase in royalties received from TSMC, a major foundry partner, and from another licensee due to higher manufacturing volumes for their products. We expect royalty revenues todecrease in 2012, primarily due to reduced shipments by the IDM licensee, as the Nintendo Wii game console is expected to be replaced in 2012 by a new console that does not incorporate our technology.           Royaltyrevenue increased $1.1 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase in royalties received from TSMC, and a fabless semiconductor company resulting from highermanufacturing volumes for their products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in shipments by an IDM licensee whose product is used in the Nintendo Wii game console, as well asdecreased royalties received from licensees with products incorporating older generation technologies, such as 1.80 micron and 1.30 micron fabrication processes, which are approaching end of productlife.     Cost of Net Revenue and Gross Profit.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2011      2010      2009      2010 to 2011      2009 to 2010              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Cost of net revenue     $  3,295     $  2,826     $  1,993     $  469        17  %  $  833        42  %      Percentage of total net revenue        23  %     18  %     17  %                                                                                  Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2011      2010      2009      2010 to 2011      2009 to 2010              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Gross profit     $  10,812     $  12,737     $  9,465     $  (1,925  )      (15  )%  $  3,272        35  %      Percentage of total net revenue        77  %     82  %     83  %                                                  Costof net revenue consists of personnel costs for engineers assigned to revenue-generating licensing arrangements and related overhead allocation costs. Direct laborhours are tracked for each licensing arrangements and are used to measure the progress of completion.           Costof net revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to two 1T-SRAM projects that were substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 in which we expensed$1.2 million of previously capitalized deferred costs. Cost of net revenue in 2011 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million, an increase of $0.1 million comparedwith 2010. Total gross profit decreased to $10.8 million in 2011 primarily due to the lower margin contribution from the two 1T-SRAM projects and the decrease in royalty revenues. Weexpect that the cost of licensing revenue will decrease in absolute dollars in the future because we anticipate entering into fewer license agreements. We expect cost as a percentage of total netrevenue to increase as we begin to generate revenues more from the sale of ICs rather than the licensing of IP.           Theincrease in cost of net revenue for 2010 compared with 2009 resulted primarily from an increase in the number of licensing contracts requiring customization. Cost of net revenue in2010 included stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million, which was consistent with the prior year. Total gross profit increased to $12.7 million in 2010 primarily due to anincrease in license and royalty revenues.   34                         Research and Development.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2011      2010      2009      2010 to 2011      2009 to 2010              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Research and development     $  26,216     $  25,534     $  19,255     $  682        3  %  $  6,279        33  %      Percentage of total net revenue        186  %     164  %     168  %                                                  Ourresearch and development expenses include development and design of variations of our 1T-SRAM and I/O technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used bylicensees, costs related to the development of the Bandwidth Engine IC and amortization of technology-based intangible assets. In 2009, we incurred costs of $0.4 million, related to our formeranalog/mixed-signal product lines, which we exited in late 2008. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.           The$0.7 million increase in 2011 was primarily due to increases in license costs for our CAD software tools, costs related to the development of our Bandwidth Engine IC andstock-based compensation charges, offset by a decrease in acquisition-related contingent compensation charges.           The$6.3 million increase in 2010 was primarily due to our expanded engineering team working on our I/O and Bandwidth Engine IC products, mask tooling and other fabrication costs,increased amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets and increased costs for our CAD software tools.           Researchand development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $2.0 million, $1.5 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011,2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect that research and development expenses will remain flat or decrease slightly in absolute dollars, but will increase as a percentage of total revenue as our IPrevenues decline faster than our IC revenues ramp. The primary driver of research and development expense will be our continued investment in our current and next generation Bandwidth Engine ICproducts.     Selling, General and Administrative.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2011      2010      2009      2010 to 2011      2009 to 2010              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Selling, general and administrative     $  8,869     $  10,391     $  9,507     $  (1,522  )      (15  )%  $  884        9  %      Percentage of total net revenue        63  %     67  %     83  %                                                  Selling,general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, application engineering, finance, human resources and generalmanagement.           The$1.5 million decrease for 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related, acquisition-related and consulting costs.           The$0.9 million increase for 2010 was primarily due to an increase in legal, marketing and personnel-related costs.           Selling,general and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $1.7 million for the years endedDecember 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect total selling, general and administrative expenses to remain flat or slightly decrease in absolute dollars, but increase as apercentage of revenues as our IP revenues decline faster than our IC revenues ramp.   35          Gain on Sale of Patents.                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2011      2010      2009      2010 to 2011      2009 to 2010              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Gain on sale of patents     $  35,611     $       $       $  35,611        100  %  $                   Percentage of total net revenue        252  %                                                                  InDecember 2011, we entered into a patent purchase agreement for the sale of 43 United States and 30 related foreign memory technology patents for $35.0 million in cash. Werecognized a $35.6 million gain on this transaction, which has been recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The gain was comprised of the$35.0 million of proceeds, plus $0.8 million, which we determined to be the value of our retained license to these patents, net of transaction costs.

Interest income declined by $0.2 million in 2011 and $0.6 million in 2010 primarily due to lower average investment balances andlower interest rates earned.     Income Tax Provision (Benefit).                                          Year ended December 31,      Year-Over-Year Change              2011      2010      2009      2010 to 2011      2009 to 2010              (dollar amounts in thousands)         Income tax provision (benefit)     $  288     $  51     $  (155  )  $  237        465  %  $  206        133  %      Percentage of total net revenue        2  %             1  %                                                  Our2011 income tax provision was attributable to the federal alternative minimum tax, as we were profitable in 2011, and foreign jurisdictions. Our 2010 income tax provision wasprimarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions. Our 2009 income tax benefit was primarily attributable to U.S. federal refundable tax credits.           Asof December 31, 2011, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $52.7 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and approximately $62.0 millionfor state income tax purposes that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and state income tax laws. The federal net operating loss carryforwardsexpire from 2027 to 2030, and state net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2017 to 2030. In 2012, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federalstatutory tax rate because of expected losses.           Asof December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had net deferred tax assets of approximately $32.4 million and $35.0 million, respectively. Because of uncertainties regardingthe realization of deferred tax assets, we had recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.   36         Liquidity and Capital Resources            As of December 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $58 million compared with a combinedbalance of $37.5 million at December 31, 2010. Our principal source of cash in 2011 was the sale of patents for $35 million in December 2011. In December 2010, we soldapproximately 5 million shares of common stock in a registered direct equity offering, raising approximately $20 million, net of transaction expenses of approximately$0.1 million. The offering was made under our existing $50 million shelf registration statement that became effective in November 2010. Our primary capital requirements are to fundworking capital, including development of Bandwidth Engine ICs, and any acquisitions that we make that require cash consideration or expenditures.           In2011, we used $15.7 million in operating activities, which primarily resulted from the net income of $11.3 million and $1.3 million generated from changes inoperating assets and liabilities, reduced by the $35.6 million gain on the sale of patents and adjusted for non-cash charges consisting of stock-based compensation of$3.8 million and depreciation and amortization of $3.7 million. The changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers, collection of receivablesand payments to vendors.           In2010, we used $15.6 million in operating activities, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $23.1 million, partially offset by non-cash chargesconsisting of stock-based compensation expense of $3.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.8 million and $0.4 million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities.The changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers, collection of receivables and payments to vendors.           In2009, we used net cash of $11.7 million in operating activities. Primarily, that amount reflected the net effects of our net loss of $19.1 million, adjusted for$1.9 million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of the acquisition of Prism Circuits, non-cash charges, including stock-based compensation expense of$3.1 million, amortization of intangible assets of $1.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $0.9 million and a non-cash restructuring charge of$0.1 million. The changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers, collection of receivables and payments to vendors.           Additionalcash uses in 2011 included the payment of $1.5 million in deferred consideration for the MagnaLynx acquisition in 2010 and the purchase of $0.3 million of fixedassets.           Ourinvesting activities in 2010 included business acquisition payments of $7.9 million, of which $4.6 million related to a contingent payment related to the acquisition of PrismCircuits and $3.3 million related to the acquisition of MagnaLynx in the first quarter of 2010. In 2010, we purchased $1.4 million of fixed assets. Remaining investing activities consisted ofinvesting our cash in marketable securities.           Ourinvesting activities in 2009 included a net payment of $13.6 million for the acquisition of Prism Circuits and $1.1 million for purchases of fixed assets during 2009.           Ourfinancing activities in 2011 primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Our cash from financing activities in 2010 consisted of the proceeds of ourregistered direct offering of common stock and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Cash used in financing activities in 2009 consisted of $0.9 million used for stock repurchases underour repurchase program prior to its suspension in February 2009.           Ourfuture liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter, depending on numerous factors, including:     level and timing of licensing, royalty and IC product revenue;    37           cost, timing and success of technology development efforts, including meeting customer design specifications;      fabrication costs, including mask costs of our Bandwidth Engine ICs, currently under development;      variations in manufacturing yields, materials costs and other manufacturing risks;      costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations; and      profitability of our business.            Weexpect our cash expenditures to continue to exceed receipts in 2012 as we will generate minimal revenue from IC sales and expect reduced licensing and royalty revenues compared with2011, and we will continue our research and development efforts for the expansion and fabrication of the Bandwidth Engine IC product line. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents andinvestments, along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations, if any, to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Should our cash resources proveinadequate, we may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing, and have a shelf registration allowing us to sell up to approximately $30 million of oursecurities from time to time until November 2013. We also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in our interests, including,but not limited to, from the sale of our debt and/or equity securities under our existing shelf registration statement. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to uson favorable terms, if at all. The failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.    Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments            The impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow infuture periods is as follows:                                  Payment Due by Period              Total      Less than 1 year      1-3 years      3-5 years      More than 5 years          Operating leases     $  6,406     $  837     $  1,546     $  1,366     $  2,657         Purchase commitments        3,349        3,299        50                         Capital leases        153        153                                                                           $  9,908     $  4,289     $  1,596     $  1,366     $  2,657                                                       Asof December 31, 2011, we had purchase commitments of $3.1 million for licenses related to computer-aided design tools payable through January 2013, $0.2 millionin other purchase commitments and $0.2 million in capital lease obligations for testing equipment. In July 2010, we entered into a 10 year operating lease agreement for approximately47,000 square feet with Mission West Properties, Inc. for our corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements            We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material currentor future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

Such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers anddirectors. No material amounts are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for 2011, 2010 or 2009 related to these indemnifications.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk         Interest rate risk            We have exposure to interest rate risk due to our investment portfolio. Our investments are made in accordance with an investmentpolicy approved by our board of directors. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and meet liquidity needs. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio ofcash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agency debt, municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, andmoney market funds. We place our investments with high-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund.           Theinvestments, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains andlosses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Securities with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Securities withoriginal maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Securities with remaining maturities greater than oneyear are classified as long-term investments. All investments have a maturity of less than two years. No single security should exceed 5% of the portfolio at the time of purchase. Theportfolio's dollar-weighted average maturity of investments is within 12 months. These securities, which approximated $21.0 million as of December 31, 2011 and earned an averageannual interest rate of approximately 0.5% in 2011, are subject to interest rate and credit risks. As of December 31, 2011, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio.According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/- 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately $0.1 million. We do not haveany investments denominated in foreign currencies, and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments.    Foreign currency exchange rate risk            Currently, all of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as a result, we have not experienced significant foreignexchange gains or losses to date. However, the expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in their local currencies, therefore we have risk of foreign exchange gains and losses through thefunding of those expenditures. We do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for tradingor speculative purposes. However, in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases, we may choose to hedge those exposures. For most currencies, we are a net payer of foreign currenciesand, therefore, benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies.   39                  Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
