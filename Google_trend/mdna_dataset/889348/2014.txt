Item 7.        MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward-Looking Statements     When used in this Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the words or phrases “will likely result,” “management expects” or “we expect,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made.  Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected.  The risks are included in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” and “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K.  We have no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions, which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.     You should read the financial information set forth below in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.     Business Operations     We are engaged in the contract production of structural aircraft parts for fixed wing aircraft and helicopters in both the commercial and defense markets.  Within the global aerostructure supply chain, we are either a Tier 1 supplier to aircraft OEMs or a Tier 2 subcontractor to major Tier 1 manufacturers.  We also are a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Defense, primarily the Air Force.  In conjunction with our assembly operations, we provide engineering, program management, supply chain management, and MRO services.           Page 18                           Critical Accounting Policies     Revenue Recognition     We recognize revenue from our contracts over the contractual period under the percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting.  Under the POC method of accounting, revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract.  Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as an asset captioned “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.”  Contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as a liability captioned “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.”  Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract.  Estimates are reviewed monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the financial statements in the period the change becomes known.  The use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods.  As a result, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and taxes) as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period.  We continually evaluate all of the issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the POC method of accounting; however, we cannot assure you that our estimates will be accurate.  If our estimates are not accurate or a contract is terminated, we will be forced to adjust revenue in later periods.  Furthermore, even if our estimates are accurate, we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and we may need to borrow money to pay taxes until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts.        Page 19                              Results of Operations     Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012     Revenue .  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $82,988,522 compared to $89,272,582 for the same period last year, representing a decrease of $6,284,060 or 7.0%.     Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1,373,456 compared to $6,239,286 for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $4,865,830 or 78%.  This decrease is consistent with our strategy, as we transition away from being a prime government contractor.     Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $54,837,383 compared to $56,357,371 for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $1,519,988 or 2.7%.     Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $26,777,683 for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $26,675,925 for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $101,758 or 0.4%.     During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received approximately $122.3 million of new contract awards, which included no government prime contract awards, approximately $96.0 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $26.3 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $81.6 million of new contract awards in 2012, which included $.4 million of government prime contract awards, $74.7 million of government subcontract awards and $6.5 million of commercial contract awards.     Gross profit .  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $18,433,247 compared to $24,232,613 for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $5,799,366.  Gross profit percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 22.2% compared to 27.1% for the same period last year.     The gross margin percentage is lower in 2013 than in 2012 because of adjustments to our long term programs with Spirit, NGC and Boeing as well as the C-5 Top Program.  The adjustment for our Spirit program was the result of price reductions given as part of an agreement to increase the program value and to extend the life of the program until 2019. The adjustment for NGC is a reserve against anticipated price reductions that may be necessary upon completion of a government pricing analysis. The adjustment for our Boeing program was a result of the negotiations for program changes described in the liquidity section.  The Boeing adjustment approximates a 200 basis point decrease in our gross margin percentage. The adjustment for the C-5 Top Program was the result of excess time and work required on C-5 wing tip panels     Additionally, the gross margin percentage was 80 basis points below our expected gross margin range of 23%-24%, because of additional engineering time required on a program we have with UTS Aerospace.     Because of the extremely competitive market as we transition to more commercial work, the cost justification audit related to the anticipated multiyear release on the E-2D program, as well as the normal lower margins achieved during the early stages of long-term commercial programs, we expect our gross margin percentage for 2014 to be in the range of 20%-21%.       Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $6,704,524 compared to $7,322,630 for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $618,106, or 8.4%.  This decrease was primarily due to an approximately $500,000 decrease in accrued officer’s bonus as computed pursuant to the officers’ employment agreements, a $266,000 decrease in accounting and legal fees, and a $213,000 decrease in payroll taxes, offset by a $326,000 increase in salaries as a result of increased headcount.     Interest expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $653,786, compared to $416,373 for 2012, an increase of $237,413 or 57%. The increase in interest expense is the result of an increase in the average amount of outstanding debt during 2013 as compared to 2012.     Income from operations .  We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $11,728,723 compared to $16,909,983 for the year ended December 31, 2012.  The decrease in income from operations is a result of the lower revenue and lower gross margin, as described above.             Page 20                Year Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011     Revenue .  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $89,272,582 compared to $74,135,669 for the same period in 2011, representing an increase of $15,136,913 or 20.4%.  The increase in revenue was primarily the result of work performed on our three major subcontract awards won in 2008.  The Gulfstream G650, Boeing A-10 and NGC E-2D programs accounted for 17.6%, 16.7% and 25.5%, of our revenue in 2012, respectively.     Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $6,239,286 compared to $6,740,870 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $501,584 or 7.4%.  This decrease was consistent with our strategy, as we transition away from being a prime government contractor.     Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $56,357,371 compared to $57,199,673 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $842,302 or 1%.     Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $26,675,925 for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $10,195,126 for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $16,480,799 or 162%.  This increase was primarily the result of higher production rates on the G650, as well as revenue from new production programs such as the HondaJet advanced light business jet.      During the year ended December 31, 2012, we received approximately $81.6 million of new contract awards, which included approximately $.4 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $74.7 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $6.5 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $83.6 million of new contract awards in 2011, which included $11.7 million of government prime contract awards, $24.8 million of government subcontract awards and $47.1 million of commercial contract awards.     Gross profit .  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $24,232,613 compared to $18,809,940 for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $5,422,673.  Gross profit percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 27.1% compared to 25.4% for the same period in 2011.  The gross margin percentage was within 10 basis points of our expected gross margin range of 25%-27%.     Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $7,322,630 compared to $7,931,586 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $608,956, or 7.7%.  This decrease was primarily due to an approximately $423,000 decrease in board of directors fees, which is in line with our expectations, as we changed our non-employee director compensation plan, which limits the expenses related to stock options, a $242,000 decrease in moving expenses, which was a one-time expense related to our move to larger facilities in December 2011 and a $143,000 decrease in consultants, offset by a $238,000 increase in accounting and legal fees.     Interest expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $416,373, compared to $343,491 for 2011, an increase of $72,882 or 21%. The increase was in interest expense is the result of an increase in outstanding debt during 2012 as compared to 2011.     Income from operations .  We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 of $16,909,983 compared to $10,878,354 for the year ended December 31, 2011.  The increase in operating income was predominately the result of the increased revenue and gross margin discussed earlier.        Business Outlook      We provided soft guidance that 2014 would be a return to top line growth over 2013 with revenue possibly reaching the 2012 results.  While we did have some anticipated 2014 first quarter revenue move into the fourth quarter of 2013, we remain comfortable with this estimate.  During 2014, many of our commercial programs will begin to transition toward full production.  As a result, product deliveries and customer billings are expected to surpass those of 2013, our best year ever in terms of product shipments.  The increased product shipments will be partially offset by investment in new programs in 2014 and therefore we are estimating cash flow from operations of approximately $1 million to $1.25 million.      Our newer commercial programs such as the HondaJet, Cessna Citation X and Embraer Phenom 300 business jet programs are anticipated to become a higher percentage of total revenue on a quarter over quarter and year over year comparison basis.  Historically, we have lower margins during the early stages of long-term programs.  Therefore, we expect this product mix in 2014 will produce a gross profit margin for full year 2014 in the range of 20% to 21%.  As marketing and sales forecasts for these commercial programs permit us to increase our estimate of production quantity, our gross margins on these programs will typically improve.  Looking beyond this year to 2015, we see continued strength in production rates of our business jet programs, steady production on our more mature programs and new starts that combined could produce the highest revenue in our history.  Likewise as unit costs decrease with increased build rates we anticipate gross margin expanding in full year 2015 to be higher than in 2014.     The statements in the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements of this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times.             Page 21                    Liquidity and Capital Resources     General.  At December 31, 2013, we had working capital of $88,440,083 compared to $79,708,725 at December 31, 2012, an increase of $8,731,358, or 11%.     Cash Flow.  A large portion of our cash is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments.  Costs for which we are not able to bill on a progress basis are components of “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” on our balance sheet and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed.  These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms.     Because the POC method of accounting requires us to use estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period.  Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts.     Our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings (“CEE”) increased by approximately $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 of which the Boeing A-10 contract accounted for approximately $2.1 million of this increase.  The trend, however, in this program was very positive in the last six months of 2013, as we billed $11 million and decreased the CEE by nearly $1 million.  We expect that this trend of higher billings and decreasing CEE to continue in 2014.     In order to perform on new programs, such as the UTS Aerospace and Embraer programs, we may be required to expend up-front costs that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units.  In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could be required to bear impairment charges which may be material, for costs that are not recoverable.  Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity and results of operations.     We continue to work to obtain better payment terms with our customers, including accelerated progress payment arrangements, as well as exploring alternative funding sources.     At December 31, 2013, our cash balance was $2,166,103 compared to $2,709,803 at December 31, 2012, a decrease of $543,700.  Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2013 decreased to $4,392,254 from $6,774,346 at December 31, 2012.     Bank Credit Facilities and Term Loans     Until December 2012, the Company was party to a Credit Agreement, dated August 13, 2007, as amended, between the Company and Sovereign Bank (the “Prior Agreement”), which provided for a revolving credit facility and two term loans.  Immediately prior to entering into the Restated Agreement (identified below), a revolving credit facility in the aggregate of $18.0 million was available to the Company under the Prior Agreement.     On December 5, 2012, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Sovereign Bank (“Restated Agreement”) as the sole arranger, administrative agent, collateral agent and lender and Valley National Bank as lender.  The Restated Agreement increased the revolving credit facility under the Prior Agreement from $18 million to $35 million (the “Sovereign Revolving Facility”), refinanced one of the previous term loans as a revolving credit loan, continued the other term loan and then-existing revolving credit loans, and amended and restated the general terms of the Prior Agreement.  The revolving credit loans under the Restated Agreement mature on December 5, 2016.  The Sovereign Revolving Facility and term loan under the Restated Agreement are secured by all of our assets.     As of December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Restated Agreement.     As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $21.4 million outstanding under the Restated Agreement.  As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $23.5 million outstanding under the Sovereign Revolving Facility.     On October 22, 2008, the Company obtained a $3.0 million term loan from Sovereign Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Sovereign Term Loan”). This term loan was refinanced as part of the revolving credit loan under the Restated Agreement of December 5, 2012.     On March 9, 2012, the Company obtained a $4.5 million term loan from Sovereign Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Sovereign Term Loan 2”).  The Sovereign Term Loan 2 was used by the Company to purchase tooling and equipment for new programs.  The Sovereign Term Loan 2 was continued under the Restated Agreement, and is payable in monthly installments of $75,000, with a final payment of the remaining principal balance on March 9, 2017.  The Sovereign Term Loan 2 bears interest at the lower of LIBOR plus 3% or Sovereign Bank’s prime rate. The Sovereign Term Loan 2 is subject to the amended and restated terms and conditions of the Restated Agreement.     In connection with the Sovereign Term Loan 2, the Company and Sovereign Bank entered into a five-year interest rate swap agreement, in the notional amount of $4.5 million. Under the interest rate swap, the Company pays an amount to Sovereign Bank representing interest on the notional amount at 4.11% and receives an amount from Sovereign representing interest on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 3%.  The effect of this interest rate swap will be the Company paying a fixed interest rate of 4.11% over the term of the Sovereign Term Loan 2.     We believe that our existing resources, together with the availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs for at least the next 12 months.             Page 22                Contractual Obligations.  The table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years.           Contractual Obligations                                                                          Payments Due By Period ($)     Total    Less than 1 year    1-3 years    4-5 years    After 5 years     Debt    $3,000,000    $900,000    $1,800,000    $300,000    -     Capital Lease Obligations    218,536    120,349    98,187    -    -     Operating Leases    13,967,059    1,591,604    3,163,151    3,318,847    $5,893,457     Employment Agreement Compensation **    2,799,000    923,000    1,876,000    -    -     Interest Rate Swap Agreement    31,992    -    31,992    -    -                        Total Contractual Cash Obligations    $20,016,587    $3,534,953    $6,969,330    $3,618,847    $5,893,457                          **The employment agreements provide for bonus payments that are excluded from these amounts.     Inflation.
