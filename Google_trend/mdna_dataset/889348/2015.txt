Item 7.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward-Looking Statements     When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the words or phrases “will likely result,” “management expects” or “we expect,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. The risks are included in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” and “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions, which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.     You should read the financial information set forth below in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.      Business Operations     We are engaged in the contract production of structural aircraft parts for fixed wing aircraft and helicopters in both the commercial and defense aerospace markets. We have also recently expanded our presence in the aerosystems segment of the aerospace market, with our production of various reconnaissance pod structures and fuel panel systems. Within the global aerostructure and aerosystem supply chain, we are either a Tier 1 supplier to aircraft OEMs or a Tier 2 subcontractor to major Tier 1 manufacturers. We also are a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Defense, primarily the U.S. Air Force. In conjunction with our assembly operations, we provide engineering, program management, supply chain management and kitting, and MRO services.          Page 20         Critical Accounting Policies      Revenue Recognition     We recognize revenue from our contracts over the contractual period under the percentage-of-completion (“POC”) method of accounting. Under the POC method of accounting, revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract. Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as an asset captioned “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.” Contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as a liability captioned “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.” Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract. Estimates are reviewed monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the financial statements in the period the change becomes known. The use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods. As a result, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and taxes) as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period. We continually evaluate all of the issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the POC method of accounting; however, we cannot assure you that our estimates will be accurate. If our estimates are not accurate or a contract is terminated, we will be forced to adjust revenue in later periods. Furthermore, even if our estimates are accurate, we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and we may need to borrow money to pay for costs until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts.          Page 21         Results of Operations     Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013     Revenue . Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $39,687,010 compared to $82,988,522 for the same period last year, representing a decrease of $43,301,512 or 52.2%.      Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $778,175 compared to $1,373,456 for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $595,281 or 43%. This decrease is consistent with our shift from being primarily a prime contractor to the U.S. Government to a subcontractor to large prime contractors.     Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2,059,029 compared to $54,837,383 for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $52,778,354 or 96%. Approximately $50.3 million of this decrease was a result of the change in estimate on our Wing Replacement Program for the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 Thunderbolt aircraft. During the period ended June 30, 2014, the Company adjusted the estimated total revenue and recorded a loss on the A-10 contract. This change in estimate predominately accounts for the large decrease in revenue from government subcontracts.      Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $36,849,806 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $26,777,683 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $10,072,123 or 37.6%. Approximately $5.1 million of this increase in revenue was a result in the ramp up in production on the Embrear Phenom 300 program. Additionally, approximately $1.3 million of the increase was related to production on the Cessna Citation program and $700,000 was related to the HondaJet program. All of these programs were won in the 2011-2012 timeframe and achieved regular production during 2014.      During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received approximately $92.9 million of new contract awards, which included $0.5 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $67.1 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $25.3 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $122.3 million of new contract awards in 2013, which included no government prime contract awards, $96.0 million of government subcontract awards and $26.3 million of commercial contract awards.     Gross profit/loss . Gross profit/loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was a loss of $29,724,699 compared to a profit of $18,433,247 for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $48,157,946. Gross profit/loss percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was (74.9%) compared to 22.2% for the same period last year. The swing in gross margin from a profit to a loss is the result of the change in estimate on the A-10 program described above.     Because of the extremely competitive market as we transition to more commercial work, the cost justification audit related to the anticipated multiyear release on the E-2D program, as well as the normal lower margins achieved during the early stages of long-term commercial programs, and the remaining effect of the A-10 program, we expect our gross margin percentage for 2015 to be in the range of 19%-21%.     Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $7,308,220 compared to $6,704,524 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $603,696, or 9.0%. This increase was primarily due to an approximately $148,000 increase in salaries, $100,000 of which is the result of the separation payment paid to our former CEO, a $140,000 increase in Board of Directors’ fees, the result of having one more board member in 2014 than in 2013, a $110,000 increase in computer expenses, resulting from increased computer licensing costs associated with our larger staff, an $86,000 increase in consulting fees, predominately the result of the consulting fees paid to our former CEO after his employment ended, and an $80,000 increase in employee insurance and benefits, the result of increases associated with insurance costs nationally.      Interest expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $794,428, compared to $653,786 for 2013, an increase of $140,642 or 21.5%. The increase in interest expense is the result of an increase in the average amount of outstanding debt during 2014 as compared to 2013.      Income  (loss)  from operations . We had a loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $37,032,919 compared to income of $11,728,723 for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulting predominately from the A-10 change in estimate.      Income Taxes.  Because of the change in estimate on the Company’s A-10 program, described above, the Company incurred a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014. This net loss, after adjustment for carrying back tax losses to recover previously paid taxes, results in a net operating loss carryforward at December 31, 2014 of approximately $7,600,000 which will expire in 2029.     Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012     Revenue . Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $82,988,522 compared to $89,272,582 for the same period in 2012, representing a decrease of $6,284,060 or 7.0%.          Page 22         Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1,373,456 compared to $6,239,286 for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $4,865,830 or 78%. This decrease is consistent with our strategy, as we transition away from being a prime government contractor.     Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $54,837,383 compared to $56,357,371 for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $1,519,988 or 2.7%.      Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $26,777,683 for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $26,675,925 for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $101,758 or 0.4%.      During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received approximately $122.3 million of new contract awards, which included no government prime contract awards, approximately $96.0 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $26.3 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $81.6 million of new contract awards in 2012, which included $.4 million of government prime contract awards, $74.7 million of government subcontract awards and $6.5 million of commercial contract awards.     Gross profit . Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $18,433,247 compared to $24,232,613 for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $5,799,366. Gross profit percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 22.2% compared to 27.1% for the same period last year.      The gross margin percentage is lower in 2013 than in 2012 because of adjustments to our long term programs with Spirit (now Triumph) on the G650, NGC and Boeing as well as the C-5 TOP Program. The adjustment for our G650 program was the result of price reductions given as part of an agreement to increase the program value and to extend the life of the program until 2019. The adjustment for NGC was a result of price reductions that were necessary upon the completion of a government pricing analysis. The adjustment for our Boeing program was a result of the negotiations for program changes. The Boeing adjustment approximates a 200 basis point decrease in our gross margin percentage. The adjustment for the C-5 TOP Program was the result of excess time and work required on C-5 wing tip panels     Additionally, the gross margin percentage was 80 basis points below our expected gross margin range of 23%-24%, because of excess engineering time required on our Pod program with UTAS Aerospace.     Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $6,704,524 compared to $7,322,630 for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $618,106, or 8.4%. This decrease was primarily due to an approximately $500,000 decrease in accrued officer’s bonus as computed pursuant to the officers’ employment agreements, a $266,000 decrease in accounting and legal fees, and a $213,000 decrease in payroll taxes, offset by a $326,000 increase in salaries as a result of increased headcount.      Interest expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $653,786, compared to $416,373 for 2012, an increase of $237,413 or 57%. The increase in interest expense is the result of an increase in the average amount of outstanding debt during 2013 as compared to 2012.      Income from operations . We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $11,728,723 compared to $16,909,983 for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in income from operations is a result of the lower revenue and lower gross margin, as described above.        Business Outlook     The statements in the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times.        Liquidity and Capital Resources     General.  At December 31, 2014, we had working capital of $60,864,742 compared to $88,440,083 at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $27,575,341, or 31%. This decrease was predominately the result of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts (“CEE”) being approximately $33.5 million lower at December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, because of the change in estimate on the A-10 program, previously discussed, offset by the increase in refundable income taxes.         Page 23         Cash Flow.  A large portion of our cash is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments. Costs for which we are not able to bill on a progress basis are components of CEE on our balance sheet and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed. These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms.      Because the POC method of accounting requires us to use estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period. Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts.      In order to perform on new programs, such as the UTAS Aerospace and Embraer programs, we may be required to expend up-front costs that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units.  In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could be required to bear impairment charges which may be material, for costs that are not recoverable.  Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity and results of operations.     We continue to work to obtain better payment terms with our customers, including accelerated progress payment arrangements, as well as exploring alternative funding sources.     At December 31, 2014, our cash balance was $1,504,907 compared to $2,166,103 at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $661,196. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2014 increased to $6,466,814 from $4,392,254 at December 31, 2013.      Bank Credit Facilities.        Until December 2012, the Company was party to a Credit Agreement, dated August 13, 2007, as amended, between the Company and Sovereign Bank (the “Prior Agreement”), which provided for a revolving credit facility and two term loans. Immediately prior to entering into the Restated Agreement (identified below), a revolving credit facility in the aggregate of $18.0 million was available to the Company under the Prior Agreement.     On December 5, 2012, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Sovereign Bank (“Restated Agreement”) as the sole arranger, administrative agent, collateral agent and lender and Valley National Bank as lender. The Restated Agreement increased the revolving credit facility under the Prior Agreement from $18 million to $35 million (the “Revolving Facility”), refinanced one of the previous term loans as a revolving credit loan, continued the other term loan and then-existing revolving credit loans, and amended and restated the general terms of the Prior Agreement. The revolving credit loans under the Restated Agreement mature on December 5, 2016. The Revolving Facility and term loan under the Restated Agreement are secured by all of our assets.     On August 6, 2014, the Company entered into a First Amendment and Waiver to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) with Santander Bank, N.A., formerly known as Sovereign Bank, N.A., to (i) amend certain terms of the Revolving Facility to provide that contract reimbursement payments that may be received by the Company in connection with the Company’s A-10 program will be used to prepay revolving credit loans made pursuant to the Revolving Facility and (ii) waive non-compliance by the Company of the Restated Agreement covenant requiring Minimum Net Income (as defined in the Restated Agreement) to be at least $1.00 as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2014.       As of December 31, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Restated Agreement.     As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had $25.2 million and $21.4 million, respectively, outstanding under the Revolving Facility.         Page 24         On October 22, 2008, the Company obtained a $3.0 million term loan from Sovereign Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Sovereign Term Loan”). This term loan was refinanced as part of the revolving credit loan under the Restated Agreement of December 5, 2012.     On March 9, 2012, the Company obtained a $4.5 million term loan from Sovereign Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Sovereign Term Loan 2”). The Sovereign Term Loan 2 was used by the Company to purchase tooling and equipment for new programs. The Sovereign Term Loan 2 was continued under the Restated Agreement, and is payable in monthly installments of $75,000, with a final payment of the remaining principal balance on March 9, 2017. The Sovereign Term Loan 2 bears interest at the lower of LIBOR plus 3% or Sovereign Bank’s prime rate. The Sovereign Term Loan 2 is subject to the amended and restated terms and conditions of the Restated Agreement.     In connection with the Sovereign Term Loan 2, the Company and Sovereign Bank entered into a five-year interest rate swap agreement, in the notional amount of $4.5 million. Under the interest rate swap, the Company pays an amount to Sovereign Bank representing interest on the notional amount at 4.11% and receives an amount from Sovereign representing interest on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 3%. The effect of this interest rate swap will be the Company paying a fixed interest rate of 4.11% over the term of the Sovereign Term Loan 2.     We believe that our existing resources, together with the availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs for at least the next 12 months.      Contractual Obligations.  The table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years.                  Payments Due By Period       Contractual Obligations      Total         Less than 1   year         1-3 years         4-5 years         After 5   years                                                                       Debt     $  2,100,000        $  900,000        $  1,200,000        $  -        $  -                                                                       Capital Lease Obligations        161,556           71,713           67,023        $  22,819           -                                                                       Operating Leases        12,375,456           1,562,684           3,239,849           3,400,216        $  4,172,707                                                                       Employment Agreement Compensation **        1,176,000           588,000           588,000           -           -                                                                       Interest Rate Swap Agreement        14,716           -           14,716           -           -                                                                       Total Contractual Cash Obligations     $  15,827,728        $  3,122,397        $  5,109,588        $  3,423,035        $  4,172,707        **The employment agreements provide for bonus payments that are excluded from these amounts.     Inflation.  Inflation historically has not had a material effect on our operations.     Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK     Management does not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item.     Item 8.        FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
