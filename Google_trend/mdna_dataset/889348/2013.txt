Item 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward-Looking Statements        When used in this Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the words or phrases “will likely result,” “management expects” or “we expect,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made.  Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected.  The risks are included in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” and “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K.  We have no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions, which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.        You should read the financial information set forth below in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.        Business Operations        We are engaged in the contract production of structural aircraft parts principally for the U.S. Air Force and other branches of the U.S. armed forces, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor for other defense prime contractors. We also act as a subcontractor to prime aircraft manufacturers in the production of commercial aircraft parts.        We also operate as a subcontractor to prime contractors in the production of commercial aircraft parts.           Page 18                                        Critical Accounting Policies        Revenue Recognition     We recognize revenue from our contracts over the contractual period under the percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting.  Under the POC method of accounting, revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract.  Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as an asset captioned “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.”  Contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as a liability captioned “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.”  Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract.  Estimates are reviewed monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the financial statements in the period the change becomes known.  The use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods.  As a result, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and taxes) as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period.  We continually evaluate all of the issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the POC method of accounting; however, we cannot assure you that our estimates will be accurate.  If our estimates are not accurate or a contract is terminated, we will be forced to adjust revenue in later periods.  Furthermore, even if our estimates are accurate, we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and we may need to borrow money to pay taxes until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts.        Page 19                                 Results of Operations        Year Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011        Revenue .  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $89,272,582 compared to $74,135,669 for the same period last year, representing an increase of $15,136,913 or 20.4%.  The increase in revenue is primarily the result of work performed on our three major subcontract awards won in 2008.  The Gulfstream G650, Boeing A-10 and NGC E-2D programs accounted for 17.6%, 16.7% and 25.5%, of our revenue in 2012, respectively.        Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $6,239,286 compared to $6,740,870 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $501,585 or 7.4%.  This decrease is consistent with our strategy, as we transition away from being a prime government contractor.        Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $56,357,371 compared to $57,199,673 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $842,302 or 1%.        Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $26,675,925 for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $10,195,126 for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $16,480,799 or 162%.  This increase is primarily the result of higher production rates on the G650, as well as revenue from new production programs such as the HondaJet advanced light business jet.  We expect that commercial programs will generate a larger percentage of our overall revenue in the next year, as other new commercial programs increase production.        During the year ended December 31, 2012, we received approximately $81.6 million of new contract awards, which included approximately $.4 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $74.7 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $6.5 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $83.6 million of new contract awards in 2011, which included $11.7 million of government prime contract awards, $24.8 million of government subcontract awards and $47.1 million of commercial contract awards.        Gross profit .  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $24,232,613 compared to $18,809,940 for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $5,422,673.  Gross profit percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 27.1% compared to 25.4% for the same period last year.  The gross margin percentage was within 10 basis points of our expected gross margin range of 25%-27%.        Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $7,322,630 compared to $7,931,586 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $608,956, or 7.7%.  This decrease was primarily due to an approximately $423,000 decrease in board of directors fees, which is in line with our expectations, as we changed our non-employee director compensation plan, which limits the expenses related to stock options, a $242,000 decrease in moving expenses, which was a one-time expense related to our move to larger facilities in December 2011 and a $143,000 decrease in consultants, offset by a $238,000 increase in accounting and legal fees.        Interest expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $416,373, compared to $343,491 for 2011, an increase of $72,882 or 21%. The increase in interest expense is the result of an increase in outstanding debt during 2012 as compared to 2011.        Income from operations .  We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 of $16,909,983 compared to $10,878,354 for the year ended December 31, 2011.  The increase in operating income was predominately the result of the increased revenue and gross margin discussed earlier.        Year Ended December 31, 2011 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010        Revenue .  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $74,135,669 compared to $43,990,784 for the same period last year, representing an increase of $30,144,885 or 68.5%.  The increase in revenue is primarily the result of work performed on our three major subcontract awards won in 2008.  The Gulfstream G650, Boeing A-10 and NGC E-2D programs accounted for 11%, 30% and 26% of our revenue in 2011, respectively.        Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $6,740,870 compared to $4,471,399 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $2,269,471 or 51%.        Page 20                       Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $57,199,673 compared to $31,963,271 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $25,236,402 or 79%, primarily the result of the A-10 and E-2D programs.        Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $10,195,126 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $7,556,114 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $2,639,012 or 35%.  This increase is primarily the result of higher production rates on the G650.        During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received approximately $83.6 million of new contract awards, which included approximately $11.7 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $24.8 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $47.1 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $61.7 million of new contract awards in 2010, which included $8.5 million of government prime contract awards, $48.6 million of government subcontract awards and $4.6 million of commercial contract awards.        Gross profit .  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $18,809,940 compared to $6,112,824 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $12,697,116.  Gross profit percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 25.4% compared to 13.9% for the same period last year.  Gross margin for 2010 was negatively affected by a change in estimate on a long term program.  Gross margin for 2011 has returned to a more normal level, and is within the Company’s expected range.        Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $7,931,586 compared to $5,415,292 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $2,516,294, or 46%.  This increase was primarily due to an approximately $664,000 increase in accrued bonuses, a $463,000 increase in board of directors fees, $263,000 of expenses related to moving to our new facility, a $226,000 increase in computer expenses, a $200,000 increase in salaries and a $111,000 increase in office expense.  The increase in board of directors fees was the result of an increase in fair market value of the options granted to the non-employee board members as compensation.  The increase in salaries is the result of higher employee count as well as normal salary increases.  The increase in accrued bonus is the result of higher executive officer bonus computed pursuant to the executive officer employment agreements.        Interest expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $343,491, compared to $158,406 for 2010, an increase of $185,085 or 117%. The increase in interest expense is the result of an increase in outstanding debt during 2011 as compared to 2010.        Income from operations .  We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $10,878,354 compared to $697,532 for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The increase in operating income was predominately the result of the increased revenue and gross margin discussed earlier.        Business Outlook        Because of the uncertainty of sequestration, which has existed in the military aerospace business environment since mid-2012, we have experienced slower than expected new business awards and releases that were expected on long-term programs that have been delayed.  As a result, we project that 2013 revenue and earnings will be lower than 2012 and the results will be similar to those of 2011.  We further expect that product shipments will be greater in 2013 than in 2012 as many of our programs transition from development to production. These increasing shipments, combined with less spending for startup costs associated with new contracts and a decline in non-recurring expenses on our maturing programs, is expected to result in positive cash flow from operations.        The statements in the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements of this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times.           Liquidity and Capital Resources        General.  At December 31, 2012, we had working capital of $79,708,725 compared to $52,186,436 at December 31, 2011, an increase of $27,522,289, or 53%.                 Page 21                 Cash Flow.  A large portion of our cash is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments.  Costs for which we are not able to bill on a progress basis are components of “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” on our balance sheet and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed.  These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms.        Because the POC method of accounting requires us to use estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period.  Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts.        Our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings increased by approximately $29.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2012.  The Boeing A-10 contract accounted for approximately $10.4 million of this increase.  Although this contract does provide for milestone billings, the program has reached the end of the milestone billing phase and as such we are no longer able to invoice this program on a progress basis.  Additionally, Boeing has made engineering changes to parts under contract with us.  We have not yet completed pricing negotiations related to these changes.  We are contractually obligated to continue production on these parts; however, we are not able to invoice for the expected full value until price negotiations are completed.        Because of our high growth rate, in order to perform on new programs, such as the recently announced Goodrich and Embraer programs, we may be required to expend up-front costs that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units.  In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could be required to bear impairment charges which may be material, for costs that are not recoverable.  Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity and results of operations.        We continue to work to obtain better payment terms with our customers, including accelerated progress payment arrangements, as well as exploring alternative funding sources.        Additionally, at December 31, 2012, our cash balance was $2,709,803 compared to $878,200 at December 31, 2011, an increase of $1,831,603.  Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2012 increased to $8,287,250 from $4,285,570 at December 31, 2011.  As of December 31, 2012 approximately $1,512,000 of accounts receivable are classified as non-current other assets.     Bank Credit Facilities.  In August 2007, we entered into a revolving credit facility with Sovereign Bank (the “Sovereign Revolving Facility”), secured by all of our assets.    On May 26, 2010, the Company and Sovereign Bank entered into a third amendment to the Sovereign Revolving Facility increasing the existing revolving credit   facility under the Credit Agreement from an aggregate of $3.5 million to an aggregate of $4.0 million and extending the term of the revolving credit facility from August 2011 to August 2013.  In addition, the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility was decreased to (i) the greater of 3.75% or 3.25% in excess of the LIBOR Rate or (ii) the greater of 3.75% or 0.50% in excess of Sovereign Bank’s prime rate, as elected by the Company in accordance with the Credit Agreement .     On May 10, 2011, the Company entered into a fifth amendment to the Sovereign Revolving Facility, increasing the existing revolving credit facility from an aggregate of $4 million to an aggregate of $10 million and extending the term from August 2013 to August 2014.  In addition, the interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit facility will no longer be subject to a minimum rate of 3.75%.        On September 1, 2011, the Company entered into a sixth amendment to the Sovereign Revolving Facility, providing for a $3.0 increase until November 30, 2011 of the existing revolving credit facility, from an aggregate of $10.0 million to an aggregate of $13.0 million.     On November 29, 2011, the Company entered into a seventh amendment to the Sovereign Revolving Facility   which increased the existing revolving credit facility from an aggregate of $13.0 million to an aggregate of $18.0 million and extended the term of earlier terminating revolving credit loans to August 2014.  The Amendment also provides for a reduction in the interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit facility to 2.75% in excess of the LIBOR rate or Sovereign Bank’s prime rate, as elected by the Company in accordance with the Credit Agreement, a reduction in the commitment fee to a rate of 0.4% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment, commencing December 31, 2011 and the addition of a covenant to the Credit Agreement requiring that the Company maintain a ratio of Unsubordinated Liabilities to Capital Base, as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement.                    Page 22              On December 5, 2012, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Sovereign Bank as the sole arranger, administrative agent and collateral agent and Valley National Bank.  The Restated Agreement provides for a revolving credit loan commitment, which replaces the Sovereign Revolving Facility, of $35 million and a term loan of $3.9 million.  The term of the Restated Agreement is through December 2016.  The Restated Agreement increases the availability under, and amends and restates the Credit Agreement, dated as of August 13, 2007, as subsequently amended, between the Company and Sovereign Bank (the “Prior Agreement”), which provided for a revolving credit loan commitment and two term loans.  One of the term loans under the Prior Agreement was refinanced as a revolving credit loan under the Restated Agreement.  The other term loan and the revolving credit loans under the Prior Agreement continued as a term loan and revolving credit loan under the Restated Agreement.       As of December 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.          As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $23.5 million outstanding under the Restated Agreement.  As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $16.1 million outstanding under the Sovereign Revolving Facility.       On October 22, 2008, we obtained a $3 million term loan from Sovereign Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Sovereign Term Facility”).  Prior to entering into the term loan we had borrowed $2.5 million under the Sovereign Revolving Facility to fund the initial tooling costs related to the previously mentioned long-term contract with Spirit.  We used the proceeds from the Sovereign Term Facility to repay the borrowings under the Sovereign Revolving Facility and to pay for additional tooling related to the Spirit contract.  This term loan was refinanced as a revolving credit loan under the Restated Agreement of December 5, 2012.        On March 9, 2012, the Company obtained a $4.5 million term loan from Sovereign Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Sovereign Term Facility 2”). Sovereign Term Facility 2 was used to purchase tooling and equipment for new programs.  Sovereign Term Facility 2 bears interest at the lower of LIBOR plus 3% or Sovereign Bank’s prime rate.        The terms and conditions of the Sovereign Revolving Facility are applicable to the Sovereign Term Facility.        Additionally, the Company and Sovereign Bank entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement, in the notional amount of $4.5 million.  Under the interest rate swap, the Company pays an amount to Sovereign Bank representing interest on the notional amount at a fixed rate of 4.11% and receives an amount from Sovereign Bank representing interest on the notional amount of a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 3%.  The effect of this interest rate swap will be the Company paying a fixed interest rate of 4.11% over the term of the Sovereign Term Facility 2.        We believe that our existing resources, together with the availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs for at least the next 12 months.        Contractual Obligations.  The table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years.           Contractual Obligations    Payments Due By Period ($)     Total    Less than 1 year    1-3 years    4-5 years    After 5 years     Debt    $3,900,000    $900,000    $1,800,000    $1,200,000    -     Capital Lease Obligations    410,437    200,564    172,470    37,403    -     Operating Leases    15,521,140    1,554,080    3,154,289    3,239,849    $7,572,922     Employment Agreement Compensation **    1,807,500    884,500    923,000    -    -     Interest Rate Swap Agreement    60,516    -    60,516    -    -     Total Contractual Cash Obligations    $21,699,593    $3,539,144    $6,110,275    $4,477,252    $7,572,922       **The employment agreements provide for bonus payments that are excluded from these amounts.     Inflation.  Inflation historically has not had a material effect on our operations.                 Page 23              Item 7A.                    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK        Management does not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item.        Item 8.                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
