Item 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward-Looking Statements        When used in this Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the words or phrases “will likely result,” “management expects” or “we expect,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made.  Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected.  The risks are included in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” and “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K.  We have no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions, which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.        You should read the financial information set forth below in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.        Business Operations        We are engaged in the contract production of structural aircraft parts principally for the U.S. Air Force and other branches of the U.S. armed forces, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor for other defense prime contractors. Our strategy for growth has focused primarily as a subcontractor for leading aerospace prime contractors.        Due to our success as a subcontractor to defense prime contractors and growth in the commercial sector, we are also pursuing opportunities to increase our commercial subcontracting business.         Page 17                              Among our significant contracts are:               ·      A long-term requirements contract of approximately $70 million from The Boeing Company for assemblies for 242 enhanced wings for the A-10 “Thunderbolt” attack jet. The initial orders under this contract were for $13.2 million.  The scope of work under this contract has increased to a potential value of $81 million as of December 31, 2010.               ·      An initial order of $7.9 million as part of a $98 million agreement from NGC to provide structural kits for an in-production aircraft. The 8-year agreement has the potential to generate up to $195 million in revenue over the life of the program.               ·      A long-term multi-million dollar contract from Spirit AeroSystems for major aerostructure assemblies for the Gulfstream G650 aircraft for which we will build fixed leading edge assemblies.  We anticipate that this contract will generate significant revenue for us in the future. The initial order is valued at approximately $3.5 million.  The scope of work under this contract has a potential value of $47 million over the life of the program.  Deliveries of these assemblies began in 2009 and continue through 2014.        While historically our direct U.S. Government work has typically ranged from six months to two years, our major subcontract awards for the E-2D, A-10 and G650 average a 7 year life.  Except in cases where contract terms permit us to bill on a progress basis, we must incur upfront costs in producing assemblies and bill our customers upon delivery.  Because of the upfront costs incurred, the timing of our billings and the nature of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting described below, there can be a significant disparity between the periods in which (a) costs are expended, (b) revenue and earnings are recorded and (c) cash is received.           Critical Accounting Policies        Revenue Recognition     We recognize revenue from our contracts over the contractual period under the percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting.  Under the POC method of accounting, revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract.  Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as an asset captioned “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.”  Contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as a liability captioned “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.”  Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract.  Estimates are reviewed monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the financial statements in the period the change becomes known.  The use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods.  As a result, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and taxes) as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period.  We continually evaluate all of the issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the POC method of accounting; however, we cannot assure you that our estimates will be accurate.  If our estimates are not accurate or a contract is terminated, we will be forced to adjust revenue in later periods.  Furthermore, even if our estimates are accurate, we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and we may need to borrow money to pay taxes until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts.      Page 18                               Results of Operations        Year Ended December 31, 2010 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009        Revenue .  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $43,990,784 compared to $43,906,825 for the same period last year, representing an increase of $83,958 or 0.19%.  The increase in revenue is primarily the result of work performed on our three major subcontract awards won in 2008.  The Gulfstream G650 program, Boeing A-10 program and NGC E-2D program accounted for 10%, 35% and 27% of our revenue in 2010, respectively.        Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $4,471,399 compared to $12,249,372 for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $7,777,973 or 64%.  The decrease in revenue from prime government contracts is predominately the result of changes in estimates that were necessary on three programs. The Department of Defense (“DOD”) opted to terminate the T-38 program one release earlier than expected, which caused us to revise our revenue estimate on this program.  The DOD placed purchase orders for 9 of the 10 projected years of the T-38 program.  By not placing an order for the final year (estimated to be 43 aircraft), the value of the contract approximated $56 million, instead of the $61 million that the Company had expected.  This change in estimate results in an adjustment of approximately $4.6 million.  In addition, we had two C-5 contracts where we revised our revenue estimates based on our inability to get DOD approval of a first article and the related reductions in revenue associated with the government not ordering the expected production units on these programs.  The two C-5 contracts were not related to the C-5 TOP contract.  The change in estimate for the two C-5 contracts approximated $2.6 million.        Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $31,963,271 compared to $18,826,766 for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $13,136,505 or 70%, primarily the result of the A-10 and E-2D programs.        Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $7,556,114 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $12,830,687 for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $5,274,573 or 41%.  This decrease is the result of the normal production schedule anticipated on the G650 program during testing, FAA certification and initial low rate production.        During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received approximately $61.7 million of new contract awards, which included approximately $8.5 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $48.6 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $4.6 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $23.4 million of new contract awards in 2009, which included $10.6 million of government prime contract awards, $6.9 million of government subcontract awards and $5.9 million of commercial contract awards.        As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $486 million in bids outstanding.  We continue to make bids on contracts on a weekly basis.        As the above results show, the Company has had success in our efforts to increase our subcontract business and as a result we expect to continue to focus our marketing efforts in this area for the foreseeable future.        Gross profit .  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $6,112,824 compared to $11,309,617 for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $5,196,793.  As a percentage of revenue, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 13.9% compared to 25.8% for the same period last year.  The reduced gross profit percentage is the result of the changes in estimates on the three programs described above.        Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $5,415,292 compared to $5,197,663 for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $217,629, or 4.2%.  This increase was primarily due to an approximately $303,000 increase in accounting and legal fees,  a $142,000 increase in public fees and a $101,000 increase in salaries offset by a decrease in accrued bonus of $350,000 and a  decrease in consulting fees of approximately $135,000.  The increase in accounting and legal fees was the result of strategic planning work done during the fourth quarter of 2010.  The increase in public fees was the result of increased investor relations activity.  The increase in salaries is the result of normal salary increases.  The decrease in accrued bonus is the result of lower          Page 19                               executive officer bonus computed pursuant to the executive officer employment agreements.  The decrease in consulting fees is the result of decreased computer consultant work in 2010.        Interest Expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $158,406, compared to $252,961 for 2009, a decrease of $94,555 or 37%. The decrease in interest expense is the result of a decrease in outstanding debt during 2010 as compared to 2009.            Page 20                           Income from operations .  We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $697,532 compared to $6,111,954 for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease in operating income was predominately the result of the change in estimates on the three contracts discussed earlier.          Year Ended December 31, 2009 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008        Revenue .  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $43,906,825 compared to $35,588,831 for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing an increase of $8,317,994 or 23%.  The increase in revenue is primarily the result of work performed on our three major subcontract awards won in 2008.  The Gulfstream G650 program, Boeing A-10 program and NGC E-2D program accounted for 21.4%, 17.7% and 6.3% of our revenue in 2009, respectively.        Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $12,249,372 compared to $17,412,962 for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $5,163,590 or 30%.  Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $18,826,766 compared to $10,766,994 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $8,059,772 or 75%, primarily the result of the A-10 and E-2D programs.  Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $12,830,687 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $7,408,875 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $5,421,812 or 73%, primarily a result of the G650 program.        During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received approximately $23.4 million of new contract awards, which included approximately $10.6 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $6.9 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $5.9 million of commercial subcontract awards, compared to $55.4 million of new contract awards in 2008, which included $9.2 million of government prime contract awards, $36.2 million of government subcontract awards and $10.0 million of commercial contract awards.        As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $270 million in bids outstanding.  We continue to make bids on contracts on a weekly basis.        As the above results show, the Company has had success in our efforts to increase our subcontract business and as a result we expect to continue to focus our marketing efforts in this area for the foreseeable future.        Gross profit .  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $11,309,617 compared to $8,523,588 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $2,786,029.  As a percentage of revenue, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 25.8% compared to 24.0% for the same period last year.  The increase in gross margin percentage was the result of better margins obtained on our new long-term programs as these programs mature and as we have renegotiated pricing on program changes and add on orders.        Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $5,197,663 compared to $4,717,080 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $480,583, or 10.2%.  This increase was primarily due to an approximately $835,000 increase in salaries, the result of changing the classification of certain employees from factory overhead in 2008 to selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009 offset by a decrease in consulting fees of approximately $219,000 and a decrease in public company fees of approximately $115,000.        Interest Expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $252,961, compared to $31,847 for 2008, an increase of $221,114 or 694%.  Interest expense is increased due to the Company entering into a new term loan with Sovereign Bank in October 2008, for the purpose of funding tooling on new commercial contracts.            Page 21                           Income from operations .  We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 of $6,111,954 compared to $3,806,508 for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The increase in income was a result of higher revenue and gross margin as described previously.     Business Outlook        Our expectations for 2011 are as follows:            ·      Revenue in the range of $78-$81 million, a 77%-84% increase over 2010, primarily due to the continued increase in work on our three major long-term programs (A-10, E-2D and G650);               ·      Gross margin percentage in the range of 25%-27%;               ·      Net income in the range of $9.2-$9.5 million.           Our future results of operations and other forward looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, including this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.  See “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward-Looking Statements.”  The statements in the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements of this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times.        Liquidity and Capital Resources        General.  At December 31, 2010, we had working capital of $44,377,170 compared to $39,118,450 at December 31, 2009, an increase of $5,258,720, or 13%.        Cash Flow.  A large portion of our cash is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments.  Costs for which we are not able to bill on a progress basis are components of “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” on our balance sheet and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed.  These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms.        Because the POC method of accounting requires us to use estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period.  Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts.        Our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings increased by approximately $4,146,945 during the year ended December 31, 2010.  The net increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts was primarily due to higher levels of procurement and production related to work on contract with Boeing, Spirit and NGC.  In order to perform on new programs we may be required to expend up-front costs, that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units.  In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could be required to bear impairment charges which may be material, for costs that are not recoverable.  Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity.        Additionally, at December 31, 2010, our cash balance was $823,376 compared to $2,224,825 at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $1,401,449.  Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2010 increased to $6,152,544 from $5,403,932 at December 31, 2009 and $2,479,335 at September 30, 2010.  During 2010 a large portion of our cash has been used to get the E-2D and A-10 programs up to their production levels.     Sovereign Bank Credit Facilities.  In August 2007, we entered into a new two-year, $2.5 million revolving credit facility with Sovereign Bank (the “Sovereign Revolving Facility”), secured by all of our assets.  On July 7, 2009, the Company and Sovereign Bank amended the terms of the Sovereign Revolving Facility, increasing the existing revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement from an aggregate of $2,500,000 to an aggregate of $3,500,000 and extending the term of the revolving credit facility from August 2010 to August 2011. In addition, the interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit facility was amended to (i) the greater of 4.0% or 3.5% in excess of the LIBOR rate or (ii) the greater of 4.0% or      Page 22                           0.75% in excess of Sovereign Bank’s prime rate, as elected by the Company in accordance with the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement was further amended to increase the commitment fee from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment commencing September 30, 2009, and to permit the Company’s sale of a certain single customer accounts receivable.    On May 26, 2010, the Company and Sovereign Bank entered into a third amendment to the Sovereign Revolving Facility increasing the existing revolving credit   facility under the Credit Agreement from an aggregate of $3.5 million to an aggregate of $4.0 million and extending the term of the revolving credit facility from August 2011 to August 2013.  In addition, the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility was decreased to (i) the greater of 3.75% or 3.25% in excess of the LIBOR Rate or (ii) the greater of 3.75% or 0.50% in excess of Sovereign Bank’s prime rate, as elected by the Company in accordance with the Credit Agreement .        Page 23                           On October 22, 2008, we obtained a $3 million term loan from Sovereign Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Sovereign Term Facility”).  Prior to entering into the term loan we had borrowed $2.5 million under the Sovereign Revolving Facility to fund the initial tooling costs related to the previously mentioned long-term contract with Spirit.  We used the proceeds from the Sovereign Term Facility to repay the borrowings under the Sovereign Revolving Facility and to pay for additional tooling related to the Spirit contract.  The Sovereign Term Facility bears interest at the lower of LIBOR plus 2.5% or Sovereign Bank’s prime rate (2.758% as of December 31, 2010) and is secured by all of our assets.        The terms and conditions of the Sovereign Revolving Facility are applicable to the Sovereign Term Facility.        Additionally, the Company and Sovereign Bank entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement, in the notional amount of $3 million.  Under the interest rate swap, the Company pays an amount to Sovereign Bank representing interest on the notional amount at a rate of 5.8% and receives an amount from Sovereign representing interest on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 2.5%. The effect of this interest rate swap will be the Company paying a fixed interest rate of 5.8% over the term of the Sovereign Term Facility.     As of December 31, 2010, because of the change in estimate on three prime government contracts which resulted in approximately $7.2 million adjustment to revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company was not in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement. Sovereign Bank has waived these covenants as of December 31, 2010.  In addition, the credit agrement's computation for the Debt Service Coverage Ratio has been amended beginning in the first quarter of 2011 so that the change in estimate adjustment doesn’t result in a covenant violation during the year ended December 31, 2011.  As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $800,000 outstanding under the Sovereign Revolving Facility.        We believe that our existing resources, together with the availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs for at least the next 12 months.        Contractual Obligations.  The table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years.           Contractual Obligations    Payments Due By Period ($)     Total    Less than 1 year    1-3 years    4-5 years    After 5 years     Debt    $1,750,000    $600,000    $1,150,000    -    -     Capital Lease Obligations    125,105    85,005    40,100    -    -     Operating Leases    1,873,301    447,770    936,241    $489,290    -     Employment Agreement Compensation **    2,076,300    1,229,000    847,300    -    -     Interest Rate Swap Agreement    45,404    -    45,404    -    -     Total Contractual Cash Obligations    $5,870,110    $2,361,775    $3,019,045    $489,290    $-       **The employment agreements provide for bonus payments that are excluded from these amounts.     Inflation.  Inflation historically has not had a material effect on our operations.        Item 8.                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
