Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward-Looking Statements     When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the words or phrases “will likely result,” “management expects” or “we expect,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. The risks are included in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” and “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions, which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.     You should read the financial information set forth below in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.      Business Operations     We are engaged in the contract production of structural aircraft parts for fixed wing aircraft and helicopters in both the commercial and defense markets. We have also recently expanded our presence in the aerosystems segment of the market, with our production of various reconnaissance pod structures and fuel panel systems. Within the global aerostructure and aerosystem supply chain, we are either a Tier 1 supplier to aircraft OEMs or a Tier 2 subcontractor to major Tier 1 manufacturers. We also are a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Defense, primarily the U.S. Air Force. In conjunction with our assembly operations, we provide engineering, program management, supply chain management and kitting, and MRO services.          19         Critical Accounting Policies      Revenue Recognition     We recognize revenue from our contracts over the contractual period under the percentage-of-completion (“POC”) method of accounting. Under the POC method of accounting, revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract. Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as an asset captioned “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.” Contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as a liability captioned “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.” Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract. Estimates are reviewed monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the financial statements in the period the change becomes known. The use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods. As a result, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and taxes) as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period. We continually evaluate all of the issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the POC method of accounting; however, we cannot assure you that our estimates will be accurate. If our estimates are not accurate or a contract is terminated, we will be forced to adjust revenue in later periods. Furthermore, even if our estimates are accurate, we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and we may need to borrow money to pay for costs until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts.          20         Results of Operations     Year Ended December 31, 2015 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014     Revenue . Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $100,202,557 compared to $39,687,010 for the same period last year, representing an increase of $60,515,547.      Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $892,752 compared to $778,175 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $114,577 or 14.7%.      Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $56,982,785 compared to $2,059,029 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $54,923,756. Because of the change in estimate on our Wing Replacement Program for the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 Thunderbolt aircraft (“WRP”) described below, our 2014 revenue from government subcontracts was unusually low, which resulted in the increase in revenue for 2015 as compared to 2014.       Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $42,327,020 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $36,849,806 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $5,477,214 or 14.9%. This increase is the result of an approximate $2.8 million increase in revenue on our Embraer Phenom 300 program and an a approximate $5.1 million increase in our Honda program. These programs have progressed out of the low rate early stage into a more normal production phase. These increases were offset by small decreases in our G650 program and our Sikorsky S-92 programs.      During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received approximately $61.6 million of new contract awards, which included $13.3 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $14.1 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $34.2 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $92.9 million of new contract awards in 2014, which included $0.5 million in government prime contract awards, $67.1 million of government subcontract awards and $25.3 million of commercial contract awards.   In September of last year we received a $65 million multi-year contract modification adding four additional years' worth of E-2/C-2 wing kits.  This amount was entirely included in new contract awards for the 2014 period.  This means we will no longer receive annual purchase orders for our largest program as has been the case historically, making the comparison to last year less informative.        Cost of sales      Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $83,600,854 and $69,411,709, respectively, an increase of $14,189,145 or 20.4%.     The components of the cost of sales were as follows:              Year ended             December 31,   2015         December 31,   2014                                   Procurement     $  57,473,129        $  45,106,460       Labor        9,188,417           8,558,125       Factory overhead        16,431,764           15,350,942       Other contract costs        507,544           396,182                                   Cost of Sales     $  83,600,854        $  69,411,709                                                                Procurement for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $57,473,129 compared to $45,106,460, an increase of $12,366,669 or 27.4%. The increase in procurement was the result of increased procurement on the Company’s E-2D program, as we ramp up to support our recently won multi-year contract.       Labor costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $9,188,417 compared to $8,558,125, an increase of $630,292 or 7.4%. This increase is due to more direct touch employees needed to support increased delivery volume in 2015 compared to 2014, specifically on our Embraer and Honda programs.            21          Factory overhead for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $16,431,764 compared to $15,350,942, an increase of $1,080,822 or 7.0%. This increase is the result of an increase of approximately $1,002,645 for employee benefits, predominately increasing insurance rates, offset by decreases in indirect labor of $337,322 as we continue to improve the efficiency of our workforce .     Gross profit/loss . Gross profit/loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a profit of $16,601,703 compared to a loss of $29,724,699 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $46,326,402. Gross profit/loss percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 16.6% compared to (74.9%) for the same period last year. The swing in gross margin from a profit to a loss is the result of the change in estimate on the A-10 program described above.     Favorable/Unfavorable Adjustments to Gross Profit     During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, circumstances required that we make changes in estimates to various contracts. Such changes in estimates resulted in decreases in total gross profit as follows:              Year Ended             2015         2014         2013                                               Favorable adjustments     $  1,067,000        $  700,000        $  1,258,000       Unfavorable adjustments        (2,942,000  )        (43,268,000  )        (4,958,000  )    Net adjustments     $  (1,875,000  )     $  (42,568,000  )        (3,700,000  )     For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had one contract on which we have experienced technical issues, which resulted in excess engineering time and additional procurement costs that caused an unfavorable adjustment of approximately $1,434,000. Additionally there was one contract that was running over the budgeted labor, which caused an unfavorable adjustment of approximately $758,000. No other individual favorable or unfavorable changes in estimates for the year ended December 31, 2015 were material. Additionally, on one contract we had significant engineering changes, which resulted in excess labor and procurement costs that caused an unfavorable adjustment of approximately $3,000,000.     For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately $39,915,000 of the unfavorable adjustment was the result of the changes in estimates on the Company’s A-10 WRP described earlier. In addition, the Company has one contract that has had shipping dates extended a number of times. As a result, labor and procurement costs have changed since the initial contract estimate, which resulted in an unfavorable adjustment of approximately $693,000. The Company also has one contract on which we have experienced technical issues, which resulted in excess engineering time that caused an unfavorable adjustment of approximately $599,000. Also, the Company has one multi-year contract that has experienced procurement price increases that has caused an unfavorable adjustment of approximately $555,000. No other individual favorable or unfavorable changes in estimates for the year ended December 31, 2014.     For the year ended December 31, 2013 we had three contracts which resulted in favorable adjustments of $395,000, $350,000 and $106,000, respectively. This was the result of receiving increased delivery orders during 2013 which allowed us to improve labor efficiency and to negotiate quantity discounts on procurement. Additionally, we had two contracts which resulted in unfavorable adjustments of $708,000 and $448,000, respectively. These unfavorable adjustments were the result of giving pricing discounts to customers, in exchange for increasing the on certain long term agreements. Lastly, we had one contract that had an unfavorable adjustment of $1,500,000, which was the result of excess labor and material costs incurred for rework and tooling adjustments. No other individual favorable or unfavorable changes in estimates for the year ended December 31, 2013 were material.              22           Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $7,636,148 compared to $7,308,220 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $327,928, or 4.5%. This increase was primarily due to an approximately a $70,000 increase in accrued bonuses, the result of officers not earning a bonus in 2014 because of our net loss, a $90,000 increase in Board of Directors’ fees, which was the result of having 6 outside directors on our board of directors for all of 2015, an $88,000 increase in marketing and advertising expenses and a $78,000 increase in computer expenses, resulting from increased computer licensing costs associated with our larger staff.      Interest expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $918,129 compared to $794,428 for 2014, an increase of $123,701 or 15.6%. The increase in interest expense is the result of an increase in the average amount of outstanding debt during 2015 as compared to 2014.      Income  (loss)  from operations . We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $8,965,555 compared to a loss from operations of $37,032,919 for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting predominantly from the A-10 change in estimate.      Provision for (benefit from) income taxes   Our historic effective tax rate has been between 30%-32% of taxable income. The rate has been below the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% because of our ability to utilize the domestic production activity deduction, available to companies that do manufacturing within the United States. Beginning in 2015, we are providing for state income taxes in states wehere, although we don’t have any property or full time employees, the historic method for the allocation of state income taxes, we do have sales and have employees present on at least a part time basis. As such the effective tax rate for 2015 is approximately 37%. We expect that future tax rates will approximate the 2015 effective tax rate.     Year Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013     Revenue . Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $39,687,010 compared to $82,988,522 for the same period last year, representing a decrease of $43,301,512 or 52.2%.      Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $778,175 compared to $1,373,456 for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $595,281 or 43.3%. This decrease is consistent with our shift from being primarily a prime contractor to the U.S. Government to a subcontractor to large prime contractors.     Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2,059,029 compared to $54,837,383 for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $52,778,354 or 96.2%. Approximately $50.3 million of this decrease was a result of the change in estimate on our Wing Replacement Program for the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 Thunderbolt aircraft. During the period ended June 30, 2014, the Company adjusted the estimated total revenue and recorded a loss on the A-10 contract. This change in estimate predominately accounts for the large decrease in revenue from government subcontracts.      Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $36,849,806 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $26,777,683 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $10,072,123 or 37.6%. Approximately $5.1 million of this increase in revenue was a result in the ramp up in production on the Embrear Phenom 300 program. Additionally, approximately $1.3 million of the increase was related to production on the Cessna Citation program and $700,000 was related to the HondaJet program. All of these programs were won in the 2011-2012 timeframe and achieved regular production during 2014.      During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received approximately $92.9 million of new contract awards, which included $0.5 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $67.1 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $25.3 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $122.3 million of new contract awards in 2013, which included no government prime contract awards, $96.0 million of government subcontract awards and $26.3 million of commercial contract awards.     Cost of sales     Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $69,411,709 and $64,555,275, respectively, an increase of $4,856,434,or 7.5%.            23         The components of the cost of sales were as follows:              Year ended             December 31,   2014         December 31,   2013                                   Procurement     $  45,106,460        $  44,003,746       Labor        8,558,125           6,428,728       Factory overhead        15,350,942           13,980,889       Other contract costs        396,182           141,912                                   Cost of Sales     $  69,411,709        $  64,555,275                                                                                            Procurement for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $45,106,460 compared to $44,003,746, an increase of $1,102,714 or 2.5%. The increase in procurement was the result of increased procurement on the Company’s E-2D program.      Labor costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $8,558,125 compared to $6,428,728, an increase of $2,129,397 or 33.1%. This increase is due to more direct touch employees needed to support increasing delivery volume in 2014 compared to 2013, specifically on our Embraer and Honda programs.     Factory overhead for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $15,350,942 compared to $13,980,889, an increase of $1,370,053 or 9.8%. This increase is the result of an increase of approximately $675,000 for indirect labor and payroll costs and an increase of approximately $288,000 in factory supplies related to an increase in work .            24         Gross profit/loss . Gross profit/loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was a loss of $29,724,699 compared to a profit of $18,433,247 for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $48,157,946. Gross profit/loss percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was (74.9%) compared to 22.2% for the same period last year. The swing in gross margin from a profit to a loss is the result of the change in estimate on the A-10 program described above.     Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $7,308,220 compared to $6,704,524 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $603,696, or 9.0%. This increase was primarily due to an approximately $148,000 increase in salaries, $100,000 of which is the result of the separation payment paid to our former CEO, a $140,000 increase in Board of Directors’ fees, the result of having one more board member in 2014 than in 2013, a $110,000 increase in computer expenses, resulting from increased computer licensing costs associated with our larger staff, an $86,000 increase in consulting fees, predominately the result of the consulting fees paid to our former CEO after his employment ended, and an $80,000 increase in employee insurance and benefits, the result of increases associated with insurance costs nationally.      Interest expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $794,428, compared to $653,786 for 2013, an increase of $140,642 or 21.5%. The increase in interest expense is the result of an increase in the average amount of outstanding debt during 2014 as compared to 2013.      Income  (loss)  from operations . We had a loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $37,032,919 compared to income of $11,728,723 for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulting predominately from the A-10 change in estimate.      Business Outlook     The statements in the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     General.  At December 31, 2015, we had working capital of $67,292,917 compared to $59,284,642 at December 31, 2014, an increase of $8,008,275, or 13.5%.      C ash Flow.  A large portion of our cash is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments. Costs for which we are not able to bill on a progress basis are components of CEE on our balance sheet and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed. These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms.      Because the POC method of accounting requires us to use estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period. Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts.      In order to perform on new programs, we may be required to expend up-front costs that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units.  In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could be required to bear impairment charges, which may be material for costs that are not recoverable.  Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity and results of operations.     We continue to work to obtain better payment terms with our customers, including accelerated progress payment arrangements, as well as exploring alternative funding sources.     At December 31, 2015, our cash balance was $1,002,023 compared to $1,504,907 at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $502,884. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2015 increased to $7,665,837 from $6,466,814 at December 31, 2014.             25         Bank Credit Facilities.     On December 5, 2012, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Santander Bank (“Restated Agreement”) as the sole arranger, administrative agent, collateral agent and lender and Valley National Bank as lender. The Restated Agreement provided for a revolving credit facility of $35 million (the “Revolving Facility”). The Revolving Facility and term loan under the Restated Agreement are secured by all of our assets.     As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Restated Agreement.     As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $23.7 million and $25.2 million, respectively, outstanding under the Revolving Facility.     On March 9, 2012, the Company obtained a $4.5 million term loan from Santander Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Santander Term Loan”). The Santander Term Loan was used by the Company to purchase tooling and equipment for new programs. The Santander Term Loan was continued under the Restated Agreement, and was payable in monthly installments of $75,000, with a final payment of the remaining principal balance on March 9, 2017. The Santander Term Loan bore interest at the lower of LIBOR plus 3% or Santander Bank’s prime rate. The Santander Term Loan was subject to the amended and restated terms and conditions of the Restated Agreement.     In connection with the Santander Term Loan, the Company and Santander Bank entered into a five-year interest rate swap agreement, in the notional amount of $4.5 million. Under the interest rate swap, the Company paid an amount to Santander Bank representing interest on the notional amount at 4.11% and received an amount from Sovereign representing interest on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 3%. The effect of this interest rate swap was that the Company paid a fixed interest rate of 4.11% over the term of the Santander Term Loan.     On March 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank United, N.A. as the sole arranger, administrative agent and collateral agent (the “BankUnited Facility”). The BankUnited Facility provides for a revolving credit loan commitment of $30 million and a $10 million term loan. The proceeds of the BankUnited Facility were used to pay off all amounts outstanding under the Santander Term Loan and the Revolving Facility. The term of the BankUnited Facility is through March of 2019. The revolving loan bears interest at a rate based upon a pricing grid, as defined in the agreement. The range for LIBOR based loans is between 2% and 2.75% above the then applicable LIBOR rate. The range of base rate loans is between the bank’s prime rate and 0.25% above the bank’s prime rate.      In connection with the BankUnited Facility, the Company terminated the Santander interest rate swap agreement.      We believe that our existing resources, together with the availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs for at least the next 12 months.      Contractual Obligations.  The table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years.                  Payments Due By Period       Contractual Obligations      Total         Less than 1  year         1-3 years         4-5 years         After 5  years       Debt     $  1,200,000        $  900,000        $  300,000           -           -       Capital Lease Obligations        295,452           111,491           124,165        $  59,796           -       Operating Leases        10,812,771           1,600,467           3,318,847           3,484,025        $  2,409,432       Employment Agreement Compensation **        606,000           606,000           --           -           -       Interest Rate Swap Agreement        4,453           -           4,453           -           -       Total Contractual Cash Obligations     $  12,918,676        $  3,217,958        $  3,747,465        $  3,543,821        $  2,409,432        **The employment agreements provide for bonus payments that are excluded from these amounts.     Inflation.
