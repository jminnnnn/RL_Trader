Item 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward-Looking Statements        When used in this Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the words or phrases “will likely result,” “management expects” or “we expect,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made.  Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected.  The risks are included in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” and “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K.  We have no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions, which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.        You should read the financial information set forth below in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.        Business Operations        We are engaged in the contract production of structural aircraft parts principally for the U.S. Air Force and other branches of the U.S. armed forces, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor for other defense prime contractors. Our strategy for growth has focused on government and military sales as a prime contractor and increasingly as a subcontractor for leading aerospace prime contractors.        Due to our success as a subcontractor to defense prime contractors and growth in the commercial sector, we are also pursuing opportunities to increase our commercial subcontracting business.         Page 17                              Among our significant contracts are:               ·      A long-term requirements contract of approximately $70 million from The Boeing Company for assemblies for 242 enhanced wings for the A-10 “Thunderbolt” attack jet. The initial orders under this contract were for $13.2 million.               ·      An initial order of $7.9 million as part of a $98 million agreement from NGC to provide structural kits for an in-production aircraft. The 8-year agreement has the potential to generate up to $150 million in revenue over the life of the program.               ·      A long-term multi-million dollar contract from Spirit AeroSystems for major aerostructure assemblies for the Gulfstream G650 aircraft for which we will build fixed leading edge assemblies.  We anticipate that this contract will generate significant revenue for us in the future. The initial order is valued at approximately $3.5 million.  Deliveries of these assemblies began in 2009 and continue through 2014.                 The lengths of our contracts vary but are typically between nine months and two years for U.S. government contracts (although our T-38 contract and our C-5 TOP contract are for periods of ten years and seven years, respectively),  and up to ten years for commercial contracts. Except in cases where contract terms permit us to bill on a progress basis, we must incur upfront costs in producing assemblies and bill our customers upon delivery.  Because of the upfront costs incurred, the timing of our billings and the nature of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting described below, there can be a significant disparity between the periods in which (a) costs are expended, (b) revenue and earnings are recorded and (c) cash is received.           Critical Accounting Policies        Revenue Recognition     We recognize revenue from our contracts over the contractual period under the percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting.  Under the POC method of accounting, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract.  Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as an asset captioned “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.”  Contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as a liability captioned “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.”  Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract.  Estimates are reviewed monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the financial statements in the period the change becomes known.  The use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods.  As a result, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and taxes) as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period.  We continually evaluate all of the issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the POC method of accounting; however, we cannot assure you that our estimates will be accurate.  If our estimates are not accurate or a contract is terminated, we will be forced to adjust revenue in later periods.  Furthermore, even if our estimates are accurate, we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and we may need to borrow money to pay taxes until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts.      Page 18                               Results of Operations        Year Ended December 31, 2009 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008        Revenue .  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $43,906,825 compared to $35,588,831 for the same period last year, representing an increase of $8,317,994 or 23%.  The increase in revenue is primarily the result of work performed on our three major subcontract awards won in 2008.  The Gulfstream G650 program, Boeing A-10 program and NGC E-2D program accounted for 21.4%, 17.7% and 6.3% of our revenue in 2009, respectively.        Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $12,249,372 compared to $17,412,962 for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $5,163,590 or 30%.  Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $18,826,766 compared to $10,766,994 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $8,059,772 or 75%, primarily the result of the A-10 and E-2D programs.  Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $12,830,687 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $7,408,875 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $5,421,812 or 73%, primarily a result of the G650 program.        During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received approximately $23.4 million of new contract awards, which included approximately $10.6 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $6.9 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $5.9 million of commercial subcontract awards, compared to $55.4 million of new contract awards in 2008, which included $9.2 million of government prime contract awards, $36.2 million of government subcontract awards and $10.0 million of commercial contract awards.        As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $270 million in bids outstanding.  We continue to make bids on contracts on a weekly basis.        As the above results show, the Company has had success in our efforts to increase our subcontract business and as a result we expect to continue to focus our marketing efforts in this area for the foreseeable future.        Gross profit .  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $11,309,617 compared to $8,523,588 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $2,786,029.  As a percentage of revenue, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 25.8% compared to 24.0% for the same period last year. The increase in gross margin percentage was the result of better margins obtained on our new long-term programs as these programs mature and as we have renegotiated pricing on program changes and add on orders  .        Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $5,197,663 compared to $4,717,080 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $480,583, or 10.2%.  This increase was primarily due to an approximately $835,000 increase in salaries, the result of changing the classification of certain employees from factory overhead in 2008 to selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009 offset by a decrease in consulting fees of approximately $219,000 and a decrease in public company fees of approximately $115,000.        Interest Expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $252,961, compared to $31,847 for 2008, an increase of $221,114 or 694%.  Interest expense is increased due to the Company entering into a new term loan with Sovereign Bank in October 2008, for the purpose of funding tooling on new commercial contracts.            Page 19                           Income from operations .  We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 of $6,111,954 compared to $3,806,508 for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The increase in income was a result of higher revenue and gross margin as described previously.    Year Ended December 31, 2008 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007    Revenue.   Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $35,588,831 compared to $27,985,476 for the same period last year, representing an increase of $7,603,355 or 27%.  The increase in revenue is primarily the result of our efforts to increase our military and commercial subcontract business.  We generate revenue primarily from government contracts for which we act as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor and, to a lesser extent, from commercial contracts.  Revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $17,412,962 compared to $17,519,198 for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of $106,236 or 0.6%.  Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $10,766,994 compared to $8,563,465 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $2,203,529 or 26%.  Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $7,408,875 for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $1,902,813 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $5,506,062 or 289%.    During the year ended December 31, 2008, we received approximately $55.4 million of new contract awards, which included approximately $9.2 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $36.2 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $10.0 million of commercial subcontract awards, compared to $37.7 million of new contract awards in 2007, which included $22.7 million of government prime contract awards, $9.0 million of government subcontract awards and $6.0 million of commercial contract awards.    As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $374 million in bids outstanding.  We continue to make bids on contracts on a weekly basis.    Gross profit .  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $8,523,588 compared to $7,389,391 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $1,134,197.  As a percentage of revenue, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 24.0% compared to 26.4% for the same period last year.    The decrease in gross margin percentage was anticipated by management and was due to the impact of starting of new long term contracts and our shift to more subcontracting business which is more price competitive.    Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $4,717,080 compared to $4,355,027 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $362,053, or 8.3%.  This increase was primarily due to a $100,000 increase in non-cash fees for stock options issued as compensation to our board of directors, a result of the higher valuation, on the same number of options issued, based on the Black-Sholes option pricing model, a $78,000 increase in public fees, which included fees paid for investor relations, fees for printing our reports and SEC filings, transfer agent fees and other expenses associated with being a public company, a $50,000 increase in miscellaneous charges taken by our commercial customers because we are doing more subcontracting work and an $88,000 increase in accounting and legal fees, which includes increased fees for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.    Interest Expense . Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $31,847, compared to $22,441 for 2007, an increase of $9,406 or 41%.  Interest expense is increased due to the company entering into a new term loan with Sovereign Bank in October 2008, for the purpose of funding tooling on new commercial contracts.     Income from operations .  We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $3,806,508 compared to $3,034,364 for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The increase in income was a result of higher sales.         Page 20                                      Business Outlook        Our expectations for 2010 are as follows:            ·      Revenue in the range of $48-$51 million, a 9%-16% increase over 2009, primarily due to the continued increase in work on our three major long-term programs (A-10, E-2D and G650);               ·      Gross margin percentage in the range of 24%-26%, comparable to our 2009 gross margin percentage;               ·      Net income in the range of $4.3-$4.8 million, a 10%-23% increase over 2009, primarily due to the expected increased revenue described above.           Our future results of operations and other forward looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, including this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.  See “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward-Looking Statements.”  The statements in the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements of this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times.        Liquidity and Capital Resources        General.  At December 31, 2009, we had working capital of $39,118,450 compared to $35,135,395 at December 31, 2008, an increase of $3,983,055, or 11.3%.        Cash Flow.  A large portion of our cash is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments.  Costs for which we are not able to bill on a progress basis are components of “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” on our balance sheet and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed.  These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms.        Because the POC method of accounting requires us to use estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period.  Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts.        Our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, net of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, increased by approximately $5,153,000 during the year ended December 31, 2009.  The net increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts was primarily due to higher levels of procurement and production related to work on new contract awards and advances made to expedite delivery of tooling required for our new long-term contracts with Boeing, Spirit and NGC.  In order to perform on new programs we may be required to expend up-front costs, that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units.  In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could be required to bear impairment charges which may be material, for costs that are not recoverable.  Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity.  Our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, net of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, increased during the year, however when compared to the balances at September 30, 2009 the balance declined by $220,000 as we have been able to begin billing certain of our long-term contracts.        Additionally, at December 31, 2009, our cash balance was $2,224,825 compared to $424,082 at December 31, 2008, an increase of $1,800,743 and our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2009 increased to $5,403,932 from $2,975,012 at December 31, 2008 and $4,996,501 at September 30, 2009.     Sovereign Bank Credit Facilities.  In August 2007, we entered into a new two-year, $2.5 million revolving credit facility with Sovereign Bank (the “Sovereign Revolving Facility”), secured by all of our assets.  On July 7, 2009, the Company and Sovereign Bank amended the terms of the Sovereign Revolving Facility, increasing the existing revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement from an aggregate of $2,500,000 to an aggregate of $3,500,000 and extending the term of the revolving credit facility from August 2010 to August 2011.          Page  21             In addition, the interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit facility was amended to (i) the greater of 4.0% or 3.5% in excess of the LIBOR rate or (ii) the greater of 4.0% or 0.75% in excess of Sovereign Bank’s prime rate, as elected by the Company in accordance with the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement was further amended to increase the commitment fee from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment commencing September 30, 2009, and to permit the Company’s sale of a certain single customer accounts receivable.    As of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $2,200,000 outstanding under the Sovereign Revolving Facility.         Page 22                            On October 22, 2008, we obtained a $3 million term loan from Sovereign Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Sovereign Term Facility”).  Prior to entering into the term loan we had borrowed $2.5 million under the Sovereign Revolving Facility to fund the initial tooling costs related to the previously mentioned long-term contract with Spirit.  We used the proceeds from the Sovereign Term Facility to repay the borrowings under the Sovereign Revolving Facility and to pay for additional tooling related to the Spirit contract.  The Sovereign Term Facility bears interest at the lower of LIBOR plus 2.5% or Sovereign Bank’s prime rate (2.735% as of December 31, 2009) and is secured by all of our assets.        The terms and conditions of the Sovereign Revolving Facility are applicable to the Sovereign Term Facility.        Additionally, the Company and Sovereign Bank entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement, in the notional amount of $3 million.  Under the interest rate swap, the Company pays an amount to Sovereign Bank representing interest on the notional amount at a rate of 5.8% and receives an amount from Sovereign representing interest on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 2.5%. The effect of this interest rate swap will be the Company paying a fixed interest rate of 5.8% over the term of the Sovereign Term Facility.        We believe that our existing resources, together with the availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs for at least the next 12 months.        Contractual Obligations.  The table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years.           Contractual Obligations    Payments Due By Period ($)                Total                Less than 1 year                1-3 years            4-5 years            After 5 years     Debt    $2,350,000    $600,000    $1,200,000    $550,000    -     Capital Lease Obligations    87,949    36,592    51,357    -    -     Operating Leases    2,308,029    434,728    908,972    964,329    -     Employment Agreement Compensation **    3,218,000    1,142,000    2,076,000    -    -     Interest Rate Swap Agreement    52,874    -    52,874    -    -     Total Contractual Cash Obligations    $8,016,852    $2,213,320    $4,289,203    $1,514,329    $-       **The employment agreements provide for bonus payments that are excluded from these amounts.     Inflation.  Inflation historically has not had a material effect on our operations.        Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK        We are exposed to market risks, which include changes in interest rates and changes to the credit markets. We attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and through maintaining counter-party credit limits. These hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and credit risks. Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and liquidity of the credit markets. All interest rate swap contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate. We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.  We manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital.         Page 23                               Interest rate Swap Agreement.        As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement recorded in other non-current liabilities in our balance sheet was $80,113, which represented the estimated amount that would be payable upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreement based on market conditions at the time.  Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement are reflected as an adjustment to current and non-current liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the other comprehensive income (loss) as such hedges are deemed fully effective.                Item 8.                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
