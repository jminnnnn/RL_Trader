Item 7.        MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward-Looking Statements        When used in this Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the words or phrases “will likely result,” “management expects” or “we expect,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made.  Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected.  The risks are included in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” and “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-K.  We have no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions, which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.        You should read the financial information set forth below in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.        Business Operations        We are engaged in the contract production of structural aircraft parts principally for the U.S. Air Force and other branches of the U.S. armed forces, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor for other defense prime contractors. We also act as a subcontractor to prime aircraft manufactures in the production of commercial aircraft parts.        Our strategy for growth has been focused primarily as a subcontractor for leading aerospace defense prime contractors.        Due to our success as a subcontractor to defense prime contractors and growth in the commercial sector, we are also pursuing opportunities to increase our commercial subcontracting business.         Page 17                                      Critical Accounting Policies        Revenue Recognition     We recognize revenue from our contracts over the contractual period under the percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting.  Under the POC method of accounting, revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract.  Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as an asset captioned “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.”  Contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as a liability captioned “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.”  Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract.  Estimates are reviewed monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the financial statements in the period the change becomes known.  The use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods.  As a result, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and taxes) as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period.  We continually evaluate all of the issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the POC method of accounting; however, we cannot assure you that our estimates will be accurate.  If our estimates are not accurate or a contract is terminated, we will be forced to adjust revenue in later periods.  Furthermore, even if our estimates are accurate, we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and we may need to borrow money to pay taxes and to meet operating cash flow needs until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts.      Page 18                               Results of Operations        Year Ended December 31, 2011 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010        Revenue .  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $74,135,669 compared to $43,990,784 for the same period last year, representing an increase of $30,144,885 or 68.5%.  The increase in revenue is primarily the result of work performed on our three major subcontract awards won in 2008.  The Gulfstream G650 program, Boeing A-10 program and NGC E-2D program accounted for 11%, 30% and 26% of our revenue in 2011, respectively.        Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $6,740,870 compared to $4,471,399 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $2,269,471 or 51%. This increase was primarily the result of work performed on the C-5 TOP program.        Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $57,199,673 compared to $31,963,271 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $25,236,402 or 79%, primarily the result of the A-10 and E-2D programs.        Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $10,195,125 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $7,556,114 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $2,639,011 or 35%.  This increase is primarily the result of higher production rates on the G650.        During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received approximately $83.6 million of new contract awards, which included approximately $11.7 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $24.8 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $47.1 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $61.7 million of new contract awards in 2010, which included $8.5 million of government prime contract awards, $48.6 million of government subcontract awards and $4.6 million of commercial contract awards.  Included in these new contracts were awards from new customers, such as Bell and Honda.        Gross profit .  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $18,809,940 compared to $6,112,824 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $12,697,116.  Gross profit percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 25.4% compared to 13.9% for the same period last year.  Gross margin for 2010 was negatively affected by the change in estimate described in the gross profit analysis comparing the year ended December 31, 2010 to year ended December 31, 2009.  Gross margin for 2011 has returned to a more normal level, and is within the Company’s expected range.        Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $7,931,586 compared to $5,415,292 for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $2,516,294, or 46%.  This increase was primarily due to an approximately $664,000 increase in accrued bonuses, a $463,000 increase in board of directors fees, $263,000 of expenses related to moving to our new facility, a $226,000 increase in computer expenses, a $200,000 increase in salaries and a $111,000 increase in office expense.  The increase in board of directors’ fees was the result of the Black Scholes valuation of the options granted to the non-employee board members as compensation.  Because of the large expenses related to the Black Scholes valuation in recent years, we have taken steps to limit board fees in 2012, and beyond, by limiting the compensation for each board member and reducing the number of options issued.  The increase in salaries is the result of higher employee count as well as normal salary increases.  The increase in accrued bonus is the result of higher executive officer bonus computed pursuant to the executive officer employment agreements.        Interest Expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $343,491, compared to $158,406 for 2010, an increase of $185,085 or 117%. The increase in interest expense is the result of an increase in outstanding debt during 2011 as compared to 2010.        Income from operations .  We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $10,878,354 compared to $697,532 for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The increase in operating income was predominately the result of the increased revenue and gross margin discussed earlier.          Page 19                                       Year Ended December 31, 2010 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009        Revenue .  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $43,990,784 compared to $43,906,825 for the same period last year, representing an increase of $83,958 or 0.19%.  The increase in revenue is primarily the result of work performed on our three major subcontract awards won in 2008.  The Gulfstream G650 program, Boeing A-10 program and NGC E-2D program accounted for 10%, 35% and 27% of our revenue in 2010, respectively.          Page 20                                      Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $4,471,399 compared to $12,249,372 for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $7,777,973 or 64%.  The decrease in revenue from prime government contracts is predominately the result of changes in estimates that were necessary on three programs. The Department of Defense (“DOD”) opted to terminate the T-38 program one release earlier than expected, which caused us to revise our revenue estimate on this program.  The DOD placed purchase orders for 9 of the 10 projected years of the T-38 program.  By not placing an order for the final year (estimated to be 43 aircraft), the value of the contract approximated $56 million, instead of the $61 million that the Company had expected.  This change in estimate resulted in an adjustment of approximately $4.6 million.  In addition, we had two C-5 contracts where we revised our revenue estimates based on our inability to get DOD approval of a first article and the related reductions in revenue associated with the government not ordering the expected production units on these programs.  The two C-5 contracts were not related to the C-5 TOP contract.  The change in estimate for the two C-5 contracts approximated $2.6 million.        Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $31,963,271 compared to $18,826,766 for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $13,136,505 or 70%, primarily the result of the A-10 and E-2D programs.        Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $7,556,114 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $12,830,687 for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $5,274,573 or 41%.  This decrease is the result of the normal production schedule anticipated on the G650 program during testing, FAA certification and initial low rate production.        During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received approximately $61.7 million of new contract awards, which included approximately $8.5 million of government prime contract awards, approximately $48.6 million of government subcontract awards and approximately $4.6 million of commercial contract awards, compared to $23.4 million of new contract awards in 2009, which included $10.6 million of government prime contract awards, $6.9 million of government subcontract awards and $5.9 million of commercial contract awards.        Gross profit .  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $6,112,824 compared to $11,309,617 for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $5,196,793.  As a percentage of revenue, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 13.9% compared to 25.8% for the same period last year.  The reduced gross profit percentage is the result of the changes in estimates on the three programs described above.        Selling, general and administrative expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $5,415,292 compared to $5,197,663 for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $217,629, or 4.2%.  This increase was primarily due to an approximately $303,000 increase in accounting and legal fees,  a $142,000 increase in public fees and a $101,000 increase in salaries offset by a decrease in accrued bonus of $350,000 and a  decrease in consulting fees of approximately $135,000.  The increase in accounting and legal fees was the result of strategic planning work done during the fourth quarter of 2010.  The increase in public fees was the result of increased investor relations activity.  The increase in salaries is the result of normal salary increases.  The decrease in accrued bonus is the result of lower executive officer bonus computed pursuant to the executive officer employment agreements.  The decrease in consulting fees is the result of decreased computer consultant work in 2010.        Interest Expense.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $158,406, compared to $252,961 for 2009, a decrease of $94,555 or 37%. The decrease in interest expense is the result of a decrease in outstanding debt during 2010 as compared to 2009.          Page 21                                       Income from operations .  We had income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $697,532 compared to $6,111,954 for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease in operating income was predominately the result of the change in estimates on the three contracts discussed earlier.        Business Outlook        Our expectations for 2012 are as follows:                     ·    Revenue in the range of $95-$98 million, a 28%-32% increase over 2011, primarily due to the continued increase in work on our three major long-term programs (A-10, E-2D and G650);                     ·    Gross margin percentage in the range of 25%-27%;                     ·    Net income in the range of $12-$13 million.           As of February 28, 2012, we had approximately $282 million of bids outstanding.  We continue to make bids on contracts, however as we have shifted our business towards more subcontracting work, we have been more selective on the contracts on which to bid.  As a result the amount of bids outstanding has declined, as compared to last year.        Our future results of operations and other forward looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, including this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.  See “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward-Looking Statements.”  The statements in the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements of this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times.        Liquidity and Capital Resources        General.  At December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $52,186,436 compared to $44,377,170 at December 31, 2010, an increase of $7,809,266, or 18%.        Cash Flow.  A large portion of our cash is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments.  Costs for which we are not able to bill on a progress basis are components of “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” on our balance sheet and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed.  These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms.        Because the POC method of accounting requires us to use estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period.  Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts.        Our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings increased by approximately $31.8 during the year ended December 31, 2011.  The Boeing A-10 contract accounted for approximately $18 million of this increase.  Although this contract does provide for milestone billings, the Company has been limited in its ability to invoice Boeing because of the lack of performance by a supplier.  This has resulted in us not achieving certain milestone billing events.  Even with the replacement of the supplier in the fourth quarter of 2011, we remain behind contractually required delivery schedule on portions of this job.  Additionally, the contract provides that we can’t bill Boeing for approved changes to first articles until such time as the government approves the entire A-10 wing.  We have submitted all first articles on this program and are awaiting government approval of Boeing’s complete submission.  Lastly, a significant amount of production has been completed, however it can’t be shipped and invoiced, as we are awaiting a minor Boeing configuration change.  The effect of these conditions on the Boeing contract has a material impact on our liquidity.         Page 22                              In order to perform on new programs, such as the recently announced Bell, Honda and Goodrich programs, we may be required to expend up-front costs, that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units.  In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could be required to bear impairment charges which may be material, for costs that are not recoverable.  Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our profitability and liquidity.        Additionally, at December 31, 2011, our cash balance was $878,200 compared to $823,376 at December 31, 2010, an increase of $54,824.  Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2011 decreased to $4,285,570 from $6,152,544 at December 31, 2010.  During 2011 a large portion of our cash flow has been used to get the E-2D and A-10 programs up to their production levels.     Sovereign Bank Credit Facilities.  In August 2007, we entered into a two-year, $2.5 million revolving credit facility with Sovereign Bank (the “Sovereign Revolving Facility”), secured by all of our assets.  On July 7, 2009, the Company and Sovereign Bank amended the terms of the Sovereign Revolving Facility, increasing the existing revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement from an aggregate of $2,500,000 to an aggregate of $3,500,000 and extending the term of the revolving credit facility from August 2010 to August 2011. In addition, the interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit facility was amended to (i) the greater of 4.0% or 3.5% in excess of the LIBOR rate or (ii) the greater of 4.0% or 0.75% in excess of Sovereign Bank’s prime rate, as elected by the Company in accordance with the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement was further amended to increase the commitment fee from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment commencing September 30, 2009, and to permit the Company’s sale of a certain single customer accounts receivable.    On May 26, 2010, the Company and Sovereign Bank entered into a third amendment to the Sovereign Revolving Facility increasing the existing revolving credit   facility under the Credit Agreement from an aggregate of $3.5 million to an aggregate of $4.0 million and extending the term of the revolving credit facility from August 2011 to August 2013.  In addition, the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility was decreased to (i) the greater of 3.75% or 3.25% in excess of the LIBOR Rate or (ii) the greater of 3.75% or 0.50% in excess of Sovereign Bank’s prime rate, as elected by the Company in accordance with the Credit Agreement .     On May 10, 2011, the Company entered into a fifth amendment to the Sovereign Revolving Facility, increasing the existing revolving credit facility from an aggregate of $4 million to an aggregate of $10 million and extending the term from August 2013 to August 2014.  In addition, the interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit facility will no longer be subject to a minimum rate of 3.75%.        On September 1, 2011, the Company entered into a sixth amendment to the Sovereign Revolving Facility, providing for a $3,000,000 increase until November 30, 2011 of the existing revolving credit facility, from an aggregate of $10,000,000 to an aggregate of $13,000,000.     On November 29, 2011, the Company entered into a seventh amendment to the Sovereign Revolving Facility   which increased the existing revolving credit facility from an aggregate of $13,000,000 to an aggregate of $18,000,000 and extended the term of earlier terminating revolving credit loans to August 2014.  The Amendment also provides for a reduction in the interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit facility to 2.75% in excess of the LIBOR rate or Sovereign Bank’s prime rate, as elected by the Company in accordance with the Credit Agreement, a reduction in the commitment fee to a rate of 0.4% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment, commencing December 31, 2011 and the addition of a covenant to the Credit Agreement requiring that the Company maintain a ratio of Unsubordinated Liabilities to Capital Base, as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement.       As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the credit agreement.          As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $16,100,000 and $800,000, respectively, outstanding under the Sovereign Revolving Facility.       On October 22, 2008, we obtained a $3 million term loan from Sovereign Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Sovereign Term Facility”).  Prior to entering into the term loan we had borrowed $2.5 million under the Sovereign Revolving Facility to fund the initial tooling costs related to the previously mentioned long-term contract with Spirit.  We used the proceeds from the Sovereign Term Facility to repay the borrowings under the Sovereign Revolving Facility and to pay for additional tooling related to the Spirit contract.         Page 23                           The Sovereign Term Facility bears interest at the lower of LIBOR plus 2.5% or Sovereign Bank’s prime rate (2.77% as of December 31, 2011) and is secured by all of our assets.     The terms and conditions of the Sovereign Revolving Facility are applicable to the Sovereign Term Facility.     Additionally, the Company and Sovereign Bank entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement, in the notional amount of $3 million.  Under the interest rate swap, the Company pays an amount to Sovereign Bank representing interest on the notional amount at a rate of 5.8% and receives an amount from Sovereign representing interest on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 2.5%. The effect of this interest rate swap will be the Company paying a fixed interest rate of 5.8% over the term of the Sovereign Term Facility.   On March 9, 2012, the Company obtained a $4.5 million term loan from Sovereign Bank to be amortized over five years (the “Sovereign Term Facility 2”).  Sovereign Term Facility 2 will be used to purchase tooling and equipment for new programs.  Sovereign Term Facility 2 bears interest at the lower of LIBOR plus 3% or Sovereign Bank’s prime rate.      Additionally, the Company and Sovereign Bank entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement, in the notional amount of $4.5 million.  Under the interest rate swap, the Company pays an amount to Sovereign Bank representing interest on the notional amount at a rate of 4.11% and receives an amount from Sovereign Bank representing interest on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 3%. The effect of this interest rate swap will be the Company paying a fixed interest rate of 4.11% over the term of the Sovereign Term Facility 2.      We believe that our existing resources, together with the availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs for at least the next 12 months.        Contractual Obligations.  The table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years.         Contractual Obligations    Payments Due By Period ($)     Total    Less than 1 year    1-3 years    4-5 years    After 5 years     Debt    $1,150,000    $600,000    $550,000    -    -     Capital Lease Obligations    626,620    287,380    259,635    79,605    -     Operating Leases    17,038,790    1,517,650    3,145,684    3,163,151    9,212,305     Employment Agreement Compensation **    2,654,800    847,300    1,807,500    -    -     Interest Rate Swap Agreement    42,011    -    42,011    -    -     Total Contractual Cash Obligations    $21,512,221    $3,252,330    $5,804,830    $3,242,756    $9,212,305       **The employment agreements provide for bonus payments that are excluded from these amounts.     Inflation.  Inflation historically has not had a material effect on our operations.     Item 7A.            QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK     Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  We are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates. We do not utilize any particular strategy or instruments to manage our interest rate risk.        Item 8.                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
