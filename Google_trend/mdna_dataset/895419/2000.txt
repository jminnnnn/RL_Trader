Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations  All statements,  trend analysis and other information contained in the following discussion  relative to markets for our  products  and trends in revenue,  gross margins, and anticipated expense levels, as well as other statements,  including words  such as  "may,"  "will,"  "anticipate,"  "believe,"  "plan,"  "estimate," "expect," and "intend" and other similar expressions constitute  forward-looking statements.  These  forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  business  and economic  risks and  uncertainties,  and our actual  results of  operations  may differ  materially  from  those  contained  in the  forward-looking  statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences  include, but are not limited to, those  discussed in "Certain  Business Risks and  Uncertainties"  in Item 1 of this report,  as well as other risks and  uncertainties  referenced in this report.  Overview - --------  We are the world leader in developing and manufacturing  semiconductor materials and electronic  devices made from SiC. We recognize  product revenue at the time of  shipment  or in  accordance  with the  terms of the  relevant  contract.  We recognize the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of blue and green LED products. We offer LEDs at two brightness levels- high brightness blue and green products and standard blue  products.  Our LED devices are utilized by end users for automotive  backlighting,  LCD backlighting  (including  wireless handsets), indicator  lamps,  miniature  white  lighting,  indoor sign and arena  displays, outdoor  full  color  stadium  displays,  traffic  signals  and  other  lighting applications. LED products represented 63% of our revenue in fiscal 2000 and 49% in fiscal 1999.  We also derive  revenue from the sale of materials  products  made from SiC that are  used  primarily  for  research  and  development   for  new   semiconductor applications.  We also sell SiC  crystals  to C&C,  which  incorporates  them in gemstone  applications.  Sales  of  SiC  materials  products  and  SiC  crystals represented  26% of our  revenue  in fiscal  2000 and  approximately  37% during fiscal 1999.  The  balance  of our  revenue,  11% for fiscal  2000 and 14% for fiscal  1999 is derived  from  government  contract  funding.   Under  various  programs,   U.S. Government  entities  further the  development  of our technology by funding our research and development  efforts. All resulting technology remains our property after the completion of the contract, subject to certain license rights retained by the  government.  Contract  revenue  includes  funding of direct research and development costs and a portion of our general and  administrative  expenses and other  operating  expenses for contracts under which we expect funding to exceed direct  costs  over the  life of the  contract.  For  contracts  under  which we anticipate  that direct costs will exceed  amounts to be funded over the life of the contract (i.e., certain cost-share arrangements),  we report direct costs as research and  development  expenses with related  reimbursements  recorded as an offset to those expenses.  We have new product  initiatives  for RF and microwave  transistors and recently began shipping limited quantities of our first RF devices. We believe that these products can be used in a variety of  applications,  including power  amplifiers for wireless  infrastructure,  home-based  subscriber  units,  digital broadcast applications  and solid state radar.  We also have new product  initiatives  for high power devices for power conversion and switching uses and blue laser diodes for  high-density  digital  versatile  disk,  or DVD,  players and other optical storage  applications.  We are  also  developing  LEDs  with a  higher  luminous efficiency to expand our existing family of devices.  The  following  table shows our  statement  of  operations  data  expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:                                        -23-                                                          Years Ended                                            -----------------------------------                                            June 25,      June 27,     June 28,                                              2000          1999         1998                                            --------      --------     -------- Revenue:      Product revenue, net................    89.1%         85.7%        79.4%      Contract revenue, net...............    10.9          14.3         20.6                                            --------      --------     --------          Total revenue...................   100.0         100.0        100.0  Cost of Revenue:      Product revenue, net................    40.0          43.2         49.4      Contract revenue, net.............       8.2          11.5         17.1                                            --------      --------     --------          Total cost of revenue...........    48.2          54.7         66.5                                            --------      --------     -------- Gross margin.............................    51.8          45.3         33.5  Operating expenses:      Research and development..........       6.5           7.1          4.0      Sales, general and administrative       10.2          10.4         10.0      Other expense.......................     1.2           1.9          1.1                                            --------      --------     --------      Income from operations..............    33.9          25.9         18.4  Other non-operating income.............       0.6           0.2          0.0 Interest income, net....................      8.6           1.7          1.7                                            --------      --------     --------      Income before income taxes......        43.1          27.8         20.1 Income tax expense.......................    15.0          7.8          5.9                                            --------      --------     --------      Net income..........................    28.1%         20.0%        14.2%                                            ========      ========     ========   Fiscal Years Ended June 25, 2000 and June 27, 1999 - --------------------------------------------------  Revenue  Revenue grew 74% to $108.6  million in fiscal 2000 from $62.4  million in fiscal 1999. This increase was attributable to higher product  revenue,  which rose 81% to $96.7 million in fiscal 2000 from $53.4 million in fiscal 1999. This increase in product  revenue  was a result of the 124% rise in sales of our LED  products and a 24%  increase in SiC  material  revenue in fiscal 2000  compared to fiscal 1999, respectively.  Our high brightness LED products  experienced the heaviest demand. While our LED chip volume has grown 78% in fiscal 2000 over units shipped in fiscal 1999,  our average sales prices for LEDs have also  increased 26% over the prior year.  The greater  average sales price  reflects a significant  shift in mix to the higher priced high  brightness LED products.  During fiscal 2000,  the high  brightness products  sold for an average sales price that was 125% higher than the standard brightness  product.   For  fiscal  2000,  more  than  70%  of  LED  sales  were attributable to high brightness  products.  During fiscal 1999, less than 15% of LED sales were from the high brightness devices. The average sales price for the high  brightness  product  line  declined  12% in fiscal 2000 as compared to the prior year.  The increase in high  brightness  unit volume was due to the strong demand from  customers  and the  availability  of  additional  capacity from our factory  as  a  result  of  our  facility  and  equipment  expansion  and  yield improvements.  Unit shipments of the high brightness  product also increased due to the  introduction  of  small-sized  chips                                        -24-   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. The small-sized  high brightness chips represented 8% of total LED volume for that quarter.  While we continue to improve  our  manufacturing  process and yields on our high brightness and standard brightness  products,  we must continue to significantly increase our production output to meet the growing demands of our customers.  We believe that our LED products  continue to be attractive to the  marketplace due to our low prices and industry  standard vertical  structure.  We expect that in order to increase market demand for all of our LED products, we must continue to lower average sales prices, which is common in our industry. During fiscal 2001, we believe that the average  sales price for all LED products will decline based on current and projected orders. However, we are targeting strong growth for our LED  revenue  in  fiscal  2001 to more  than  offset  these  lower  prices  with significantly  higher  volume,  stemming  from  strong  customer  demand and our continued capacity expansion and yield improvements.  Revenue  attributable  to sales of SiC  materials  was 24% higher in fiscal 2000 than the same period in 1999 due to a  significant  increase in sales to C&C for gemstone  applications  and demand for wafer products.  In the second quarter of fiscal  2000,  C&C  announced  lower  sales and  higher  inventory  levels  than anticipated and we agreed to allow C&C to reschedule  approximately  one-half of its purchase commitments from the first half of calendar 2000 to the second half of the year. For fiscal 2001, we believe  gemstone sales will comprise less than 5% of total  revenue  and strong  demand  from our LED  business  will more than offset  further  reductions  in gemstone  sales.  Demand for our wafer  business remains  solid,  and we are targeting  increased  revenue from these products in fiscal 2001 due to higher demand for optoelectronic production and microwave and power device research.  Contract revenue  received from U.S.  Government  agencies  increased 32% during fiscal 2000  compared to fiscal 1999,  due to  increased  revenue on a microwave contract  awarded in late fiscal 1999, and additional  contract  awards for Cree Lighting  during  fiscal 2000.  We are  targeting  contract  revenue to increase slightly in fiscal 2001 based on contracts awarded in late fiscal 2000.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased 99% to $56.2 million in fiscal 2000 from $28.2 million in fiscal  1999.  This  increase is due  primarily  to the rise in LED sales volume discussed  above and improved  profitability.  During  fiscal 2000,  the average sales price of high brightness and standard brightness LED products declined 12% and 21%, respectively,  over the prior year. During the same comparative period, the cost of these devices  declined 45% and 28%,  respectively.  The lower costs resulted from improved yields and greater throughput.  Profits on wafer and gemstone  products have also improved during fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999,  due to higher  quality  materials  being produced with greater  yields.  As a result,  average wafer costs for SiC material  sales also declined 34% during fiscal 2000 over the comparative period.  For fiscal 2001,  we are targeting our average sales prices for LEDs to decline. Historically,  we have been successful in matching lower sales prices with lower costs.  During  fiscal  2001,  we plan to continue  our focus on reducing  costs through higher production yields and from significantly greater volumes as fixed costs are spread over a greater number of units.                                        -25-   Research and Development  Research and development  expenses  increased 59% in fiscal 2000 to $7.1 million from $4.4  million in fiscal 1999.  Much of this  increase was caused by greater investments for research and development in RF and microwave and optoelectronics programs.  In May of 1999, we signed a $2.6 million  agreement with Microvision, Inc. or MVIS, for the development of  edge-emitting  LEDs and blue laser diodes. In April 2000,  we amended our contract with MVIS to extend the agreement for an additional  two-year  period.  Under the  amended  agreement,  MVIS will fund an additional $10.0 million.  As development  costs are incurred under the original and amended contract, funding from MVIS is offset against these expenses. During fiscal 2000,  approximately $3.1 million of funding from MVIS was offset against research and development expenses. During fiscal 1999, only $500,000 was applied to research and development  expenses.  The remaining $9.0 million of funding is expected to be applied to research and  development  expenses in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002,  with $4.5 million of funding  expected to be applied each year. We believe that  including  the offset of MVIS funds in fiscal  2001,  research and development  expenses  will  continue  to grow in future  periods;  however,  we believe that as a percentage  of revenue,  research and  development  costs will remain constant.  Sales, General and Administrative  Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 71% in fiscal 2000 to $11.1 million from $6.5 million in fiscal 1999 due primarily to the general  growth in our  business.  In future  periods,  we believe  that total  sales,  general and administrative  costs will continue to increase in connection with the growth of our  business;  however,  we believe that as a  percentage  of revenue they will remain constant.  Other Expense  Other expense increased 11% to $1.3 million during fiscal 2000 from $1.2 million in fiscal 1999 due to higher write-downs for fixed assets during the year.  Other Non-Operating Income  Other  non-operating  income  increased  372% to  $700,000  in fiscal  2000 from $100,000  in  fiscal  1999 due to  greater  income  recognized  from the sale of investment securities. During fiscal 2000, a $4.1 million gain was recognized on the sale of  securities.  This gain  combined  with  one-time  proceeds  from an insurance recovery of $400,000,  more than offset a $3.8 million one-time charge for  expenses  incurred  with the  acquisition  of Nitres,  Inc. In fiscal 1999, $100,000 was recognized on the sale of securities.  Interest Income, net  Interest income, net has increased 788% to $9.4 million in fiscal 2000 from $1.1 million in fiscal 1999 due to higher  average cash balances  being  available in fiscal 2000 as a result of two public stock offerings  completed in January 2000 and February  1999.  Higher  interest  rates in fiscal 2000 also  contributed to increased  interest income.  In addition,  in November 1997, we obtained a $10.0 million term loan from  NationsBank to fund the acquisition and  construction of our  manufacturing  facility  in Durham,  North  Carolina.  The  majority of the interest incurred in the first half of fiscal 1999 was expensed and was shown as an offset to "Interest  income,  net". This loan was repaid in the third quarter of fiscal 1999;  therefore,  there was no interest expense  associated with this loan in fiscal 2000.                                        -26-   Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense for fiscal 2000 was $16.3 million compared to $4.9 million in fiscal 1999. This increase resulted from increased  profitability  during fiscal 2000 over  fiscal  1999.  Our  effective  tax rate  during  fiscal  2000 was 35% compared to 28% in fiscal 1999 due to a  reduction  in the reserve for  deferred tax assets.  Fiscal Years Ended June 27, 1999 and June 28, 1998 - --------------------------------------------------  Revenue  Revenue  grew 42% to $62.4  million in fiscal 1999 from $44.0  million in fiscal 1998. This increase was attributable to higher product  revenue,  which rose 53% to $53.4 million in fiscal 1999 from $34.9 million in fiscal 1998. This increase in product revenue was a result of the 62% rise in sales of our LED products and 58%  increase  in  materials  revenue in fiscal 1999  compared  to fiscal  1998, respectively.  Growth in LED volume  resulted from the  introduction of the new high brightness devices  and  improvements  in the product  design of and strong  demand for the standard  brightness  product.  During  fiscal 1999,  LED volume grew 160% while average sales prices declined 38%.  Revenue attributable to sales of SiC material was 58% higher in fiscal 1999 than in the same period of fiscal 1998 due to a significant  increase in sales to C&C for gemstone  applications  and strong demand for wafer products.  During fiscal 1998,  C&C was in the initial  stages of operation;  therefore,  unit sales were limited. Revenue from sales of SiC wafers were higher in fiscal 1999 as compared to  fiscal  1998,  due  to  quality  improvements  in  wafers,  along  with  the availability of the larger two-inch wafer during fiscal 1999.  During fiscal 1999, sales from our displays business declined 96% from the prior year period as we had chosen to discontinue this product line.  Contract revenue received  from U.S.  Government  agencies  also  declined 1% during  fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998,  as a significant  contract that funded  optoelectronic research was exhausted in early fiscal 1999.  Gross Profit  Gross  margin  climbed to 45% of revenue  during  fiscal 1999 as compared to 34% during fiscal 1998.  This increase is  predominantly  attributable to design and manufacturing improvements that occurred in fiscal 1999 resulting in significant reductions  in cost.  With the  introduction  of the new  conductive  buffer LED technology in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 1998, we were able to  significantly lower costs of production due to fewer manufacturing steps required with the new chip structure and improved  yield.  During the first six months of fiscal 1998, we  introduced  a smaller  LED chip  size and,  in  December  1997,  we began to fabricate  devices on a larger  two-inch  wafer.  During much of fiscal 1998, we were still in the process of establishing  these new  manufacturing  designs and had not achieved production  efficiency.  In addition, the larger two-inch wafer had not been in full production for much of fiscal 1998; therefore,  average die yields were  significantly  lower.  During fiscal 1999,  margins realized on the high  brightness  products  were lower than those derived from our standard blue LED  product,  as the yield  from the  manufacturing  process  was less than our standard product.  Average  wafer costs for SiC material  products  sales also  declined 32% during fiscal 1999 over the  comparative  period due to more  efficient  processes  and improved yield.                                        -27-   Research and Development  Research and development  expenses increased 150% in fiscal 1999 to $4.4 million from  $1.8  million  in  fiscal  1998.  Much  of this  increase  was  caused  by significantly  higher  costs  for  the  initial  development  of  the  new  high brightness  LED  products.  In May of 1999,  the company  signed a $2.6  million agreement  with MVIS for the  development of  edge-emitting  LEDs and blue laser diodes.  As development  costs were incurred  under this contract,  funding from MVIS was offset  against  these  expenses.  During  fiscal  1999,  approximately $500,000  of  funding  from MVIS was offset  against  research  and  development expenses.  The  remaining  $2.1  million of funding was applied to research  and development expenses in fiscal 2000.  Sales, General and Administrative  Sales, general and administrative  expenses increased 48% in fiscal 1999 to $6.5 million from $4.4 million in fiscal 1998 due primarily to the general  growth in our business.  In addition,  in fiscal 1998 two  insurance  events were recorded that reduced expenses by $400,000.  As a result of the dismissal of a securities class action  lawsuit in November  1997, we were  reimbursed  $200,000 for costs incurred in connection with the lawsuit. Most of these expenses were recorded in fiscal  1997.  In  addition,  we  received a $200,000  reimbursement  of medical expenses due to a negotiated cost cap in a partially  self-funded insured health plan.  Other Expense  Other expense increased 135% to $1.2 million during fiscal 1999 from $500,000 in fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1999, we realized impairments to leasehold costs as a result of  management's  decision to move equipment from our leased  facility to our new  manufacturing  site. We also wrote-off  other assets that had no future value to us.  Other Non-Operating Income  Other  non-operating  income  increased 100% to $100,000 in fiscal 1999 due to a gain  recorded for the sale of securities in that year. In fiscal 1998 there was no "Other non-operating income".  Interest Income, net  Interest  income,  net has  increased  40% to $1.1  million in fiscal  1999 from $800,000 in fiscal 1998 due to higher average cash balances  being  available in fiscal 1999 as a result of a public stock offering completed in February 1999. A portion of the  proceeds  received  from the offering was used to repay all debt that was outstanding;  therefore during much of the third quarter and all of the fourth  quarter of fiscal  1999,  there was no  interest  expense  incurred.  In November 1997, we obtained a term loan from  NationsBank to fund the acquisition and construction of our manufacturing  facility in Durham, North Carolina.  Most of that interest was capitalized during fiscal 1998.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense for fiscal 1999 was $4.9 million  compared to $2.6 million in fiscal 1998. This increase resulted from increased  profitability  during fiscal 1999 over  fiscal  1998.  Our  effective  tax rate  during  fiscal  1999 was 28% compared to 29% in fiscal 1998.                                        -28-  Liquidity and Capital Resources - -------------------------------  We have funded our operations to date through sales of equity,  bank  borrowings and revenue from product and contract sales. As of June 25, 2000, we had working capital of $266.0 million,  including  $246.3 million in cash, cash  equivalents and short-term  investments.  Operating  activities  generated  $63.0 million in fiscal 2000  compared  with $20.4 million  generated  during  fiscal 1999.  This increase was primarily attributable to net income and other non-cash expenses of $42.7  million,  a $12.8  million  increase  in  accounts  payable  and  accrued expenses,  and  a  $27.3  million  tax  benefit  associated  with  stock  option exercises.  These  amounts  were partly  offset by a $11.6  million  increase in deferred income taxes, and a $5.3 million rise in inventory.  Most of the $274.6  million of cash used in investing  activities in fiscal 2000 was related to purchases of held to maturity investments. We also invested $12.5 million to acquire available for sale marketable  securities.  We invested $78.0 million in capital  expenditures  during  fiscal 2000  compared to $41.4 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. The majority of the increase in spending was due to new equipment additions to increase  manufacturing  capacity in our crystal growth,  epitaxy and package and test areas.  Also we completed a 42,000  square foot  facility  expansion at our  production  site near  Research Triangle  Park,  North  Carolina  and began the  construction  of an  additional 250,000  square  foot  facility  expansion  at the same site.  In  addition,  we acquired a 120,000  square  foot shell  building  on 17.5 acres of land near our present  facility.  We  plan  to  use  this  facility  for  sales,  general  and administrative,  as well as for general employee service functions.  The cost to acquire this facility (not  including the upfit costs for  completing  the shell building) was $8.2 million.  The $272.9 million of cash provided by financing  activities  during fiscal 2000 related  primarily  to the receipt of $266.1  million in net  proceeds  from the January  2000  stock  offering  and the  exercise  of stock  options  and  stock warrants.  The stock warrants  exercised were distributed in connection with our September  1995 private  placement and have an exercise  price of $13.62.  As of June 25, 2000 warrants  remained  outstanding to purchase 231,000 shares;  these warrants will expire in September 2000.  We may also  issue  additional  shares of common  stock for the  acquisition  of complementary  businesses  or other  significant  assets.  From  time to time we evaluate potential  acquisitions of and investments in complementary  businesses and anticipate continuing to make such evaluations.  We are currently engaged in construction activities relating to a 250,000 square foot  expansion of our main facility to provide  added  capacity for our LED and materials and future product lines.  We are targeting  phases of this project to be finished beginning in December 2000, with the balance targeted for completion within 18 months.  We anticipate  total costs for these facilities to be between $45.0 million and $50.0 million.  Estimates for equipment costs relating to this expansion and other additions total approximately $65.0 million. We plan to fund this expansion with cash from operations and cash on hand.                                           -29-  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Quantitative Disclosures: - -------------------------  As of June 25, 2000,  the Company  maintains an investment in equity  securities that is treated for  accounting  purposes under SFAS 115 as "available for sale" securities.  This  investment  is carried at fair market value based upon quoted market price of that investment as of June 25, 2000,  with net unrealized  gains or losses  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported  as a separate  component  of stockholder's  equity.
