Item 7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Executive Summary The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including a brief discussion of our business and products, key factors that impacted our performance and a summary of our operating results. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods. Overview Cree, Inc. (Cree, we, our, or us) is a leading innovator of lighting-class light emitting diode (LED) products, lighting products and wide bandgap semiconductor products for power and radio-frequency (RF) applications. Our products are targeted for applications such as indoor and outdoor lighting, video displays, transportation, electronic signs and signals, power supplies, inverters and wireless systems. As discussed more fully below, we operate in three reportable segments: Lighting Products, LED Products and Wolfspeed. Our lighting products primarily consist of LED lighting systems and lamps. We design, manufacture and sell lighting fixtures and lamps for the commercial, industrial and consumer markets. Our LED products consist of LED chips and LED components. Our LED products enable our customers to develop and market LED-based products for lighting, video screens, automotive and other industrial applications. Our Wolfspeed business consists of silicon carbide (SiC) materials, power devices and RF devices based on wide bandgap semiconductor materials such as SiC and gallium nitride (GaN). Our materials products and power devices are used in solar, electric vehicles, motor drives, power supplies and transportation applications. Our RF devices are used in military communications, radar, satellite and telecommunication applications. As discussed more fully in Note 1, “Business,” in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, on July 13, 2016, we executed a definitive agreement to sell the Wolfspeed business to Infineon Technologies AG (Infineon).  Beginning in July 2016, the Company classified the results of the Wolfspeed business as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated statements of loss for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.  On March 6, 2017, the definitive agreement with Infineon was terminated. As a result of the termination of the agreement, we have reclassified the results of the Wolfspeed business as continuing operations in our consolidated statements of loss, and presented it as a separate reportable segment, for all periods presented. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations were reclassified as held and used in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. The majority of our products are manufactured at our production facilities located in North Carolina, Wisconsin and China. We also use contract manufacturers for certain products and aspects of product fabrication, assembly and packaging. We operate research and development facilities in North Carolina, Arkansas, California, Wisconsin, India, Italy and China (including Hong Kong). Cree, Inc. is a North Carolina corporation established in 1987, and our headquarters are in Durham, North Carolina. For further information about our consolidated revenue and earnings, please see our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Reportable Segments Our  three  reportable segments are: • Lighting Products • LED Products • Wolfspeed Reportable segments are components of an entity that have separate financial data that the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews when allocating resources and assessing performance. Our CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. 30 Our CODM does not review inter-segment transactions when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment, and inter-segment transactions are not included in our segment revenue disclosure. As such, total segment revenue is equal to our consolidated revenue. Our CODM reviews gross profit as the lowest and only level of segment profit. As such, all items below gross profit in the Consolidated Statements of Loss must be included to reconcile the consolidated gross profit to our consolidated loss before income taxes. For financial results by reportable segment, please refer to Note  14 , “Reportable Segments,” in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Research and Development Research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products, enhancements of existing products and general technology research. These costs consisted primarily of employee salaries and related compensation costs, occupancy costs, consulting costs and the cost of development equipment and supplies. The following sets forth our research and development expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):   Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 25, 2017   June 26, 2016   June 28, 2015   2016 to 2017   2015 to 2016 Research and development $158,549   $168,848   $182,797   ($10,299 )   (6 )%   ($13,949 )   (8 )% Percent of revenue 11 %   10 %   11 %                 Research and development expenses decreased in fiscal  2017  to  $158.5 million  compared to  $168.8 million  in fiscal  2016 , which decreased from  $182.8 million  in fiscal  2015 . The decrease in fiscal  2017  compared to fiscal  2016  was primarily due to cost management and the nature of current research and development projects. The decrease in fiscal  2016  compared to fiscal  2015  was primarily due to a shift in emphasis to lighting-related research and development, which is inherently less expensive than LED research and development.  36 Our research and development expenses vary significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, including the timing of new product introductions and the number and nature of our ongoing research and development activities.  Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and our executive and administrative personnel (for example, finance, human resources, information technology and legal) and consisted of salaries and related compensation costs; consulting and other professional services (such as litigation and other outside legal counsel fees, audit and other compliance costs); marketing and advertising expenses; facilities and insurance costs; and travel and other costs. The following table sets forth our sales, general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):     Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 25, 2017   June 26, 2016   June 28, 2015   2016 to 2017   2015 to 2016 Sales, general and administrative $277,175   $283,052   $290,730   ($5,877 )   (2 )%   ($7,678 )   (3 )% Percent of revenue 19 %   18 %   18 %                 Sales, general and administrative expenses in fiscal  2017  decreased  2%  to  $277.2 million  from  $283.1 million  in fiscal  2016 , which was a  3%  decrease from  $290.7 million  in fiscal  2015 . The decrease in fiscal  2017  compared to fiscal  2016  was primarily due to lower spending on corporate sales and marketing expenses related to lower sales and a decrease in litigation spending partially offset by higher Wolfspeed transaction expenses. The decrease in fiscal  2016  compared to fiscal  2015  was primarily due to lower spending on corporate sales and marketing expenses related to lower sales, partially offset by an increase in legal fees associated with intellectual property protection and enforcement. Amortization or Impairment of Acquisition-Related Intangibles As a result of our acquisitions, we have recognized various amortizable intangible assets, including customer relationships, developed technology, non-compete agreements and trade names.  Amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions was as follows (in thousands, except percentages):   Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 25,  2017   June 26,  2016   June 28,  2015   2016 to 2017   2015 to 2016 Customer relationships $6,235   $6,374   $5,614   ($139 )   (2 )%   $760   14  % Developed technology 20,860   20,321   18,642   539   3  %   1,679   9  % Non-compete agreements 404   2,037   1,960   (1,633 )   (80 )%   77   4  % Trade names, finite-lived —   —   4   —   —  %   (4 )   (100 )% Total $27,499   $28,732   $26,220   ($1,233 )   (4 )%   $2,512   10  % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased in fiscal  2017  compared to fiscal  2016  primarily due to less amortization expense for customer relationships and non-compete agreements in fiscal 2017. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the amortization of developed technology related to the acquisition of Arkansas Power Electronics International, Inc. (APEI) that was placed in service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles increased in fiscal  2016  compared to fiscal  2015  primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to the APEI acquisition as discussed in Note 3, “Acquisition,” in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 37 Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We operate a capital intensive business. As such, we dispose of a certain level of our equipment in the normal course of business as our production processes change due to production improvement initiatives or product mix changes. Due to the risk of technological obsolescence or changes in our production process, we regularly review our equipment and capitalized patent costs for possible impairment. The following table sets forth our loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets (in thousands, except percentages):   Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 25, 2017   June 26, 2016   June 28, 2015   2016 to 2017   2015 to 2016 Loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets $2,521   $16,913   $47,722   ($14,392 )   (85 )%   ($30,809 )   (65 )% We recognized a net loss of  $2.5 million ,  $16.9 million , and  $47.7 million  on the disposal of long-lived assets in fiscal years  2017 ,  2016 , and  2015 , respectively. The decrease in net loss in fiscal  2017  compared to fiscal  2016  was primarily due to the planned sale or abandonment of certain long-lived assets in fiscal  2016  to reduce excess manufacturing capacity pursuant to our restructuring plan discussed above. The net losses in fiscal  2016  and fiscal  2015  were primarily due to the planned sale or abandonment of certain long-lived assets to reduce excess manufacturing capacity pursuant to our restructuring plan discussed above.  Wolfspeed Transaction Termination Fee As discussed more fully in Note 1, “Business,” in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, as a result of the termination of the agreement to sell the Wolfspeed business to Infineon, Infineon paid us a termination fee of $12.5 million in cash on March 10, 2017.  Non-Operating Income (Expense), net The following table sets forth our non-operating income (expense), net (in thousands, except percentages):   Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 25, 2017   June 26, 2016   June 28, 2015   2016 to 2017   2015 to 2016 Gain on sale of investments, net $93   $238   $925   ($145 )   (61 )%   ($687 )   (74 )% Gain (loss) on equity investment 7,543   (15,357 )   (22,624 )   22,900   (149 )%   7,267   (32 )% Dividends from equity investment 16   1,655   2,581   (1,639 )   (99 )%   (926 )   (36 )% Interest income, net 3,696   4,472   9,086   (776 )   (17 )%   (4,614 )   (51 )% Foreign currency gain (loss), net 2,460   (4,500 )   (929 )   6,960   (155 )%   (3,571 )   384  % Other, net 200   457   572   (257 )   (56 )%   (115 )   (20 )% Non-operating income (expense), net $14,008   ($13,035 )   ($10,389 )   $27,043   (207 )%   ($2,646 )   25  % During fiscal  2017 ,  2016  and  2015 , we were in a net interest income position. Our short-term investments consisted primarily of municipal bonds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency securities, non-U.S. certificates of deposit and non-U.S. government securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is preservation of principal. Other long-term investments consisted of our approximately 15% common stock ownership interest in Lextar Electronics Corporation (Lextar), which was completed in December 2014. This investment was accounted for under the equity method from the date of investment until June 2016 when we chose for our representative not to stand for re-election as a member of the Lextar board of directors. We utilize the fair value option in accounting for our investment in Lextar. Gain on sale of investments, net .   Gain on sale of investments, net  was  $93 thousand ,  $238 thousand  and  $925 thousand  in fiscal  2017 , fiscal  2016  and fiscal  2015 , respectively. Gain on sale of investments, net decreased in fiscal  2017  primarily due to lower sales of investments. Gain on sale of investments, net decreased in fiscal  2016  primarily due to lower sales of investments. 38 Gain (loss) on equity investment .  Gain on equity investment was  $7.5 million  in fiscal 2017 and loss on equity investment was  $15.4 million  and  $22.6 million  in fiscal  2016  and fiscal  2015 , respectively. We had a gain on equity investment in fiscal  2017  due to the increase in the fair value of our Lextar investment. We had a loss on equity investment in fiscal  2016  and fiscal 2015 due to decreases in the fair value of our Lextar investment. Lextar’s stock is publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and its share price increased from 15.70 New Taiwanese Dollars (TWD) at June 26, 2016 to 18.40 TWD at June 25, 2017.  Lextar's share price declined from 30 TWD at the date of our investment in December 2014 to 21.55 TWD at June 28, 2015 and to 15.70 TWD at June 26, 2016. This volatile stock price trend may continue in the future given the risks inherent in Lextar’s business and trends affecting the Taiwan and global equity markets. Any future stock price changes will be recorded as further gains or losses on equity investment based on the increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value of the investment during the applicable fiscal period. Further losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Dividends from equity investment .  Dividends from equity investment  were  $0.0 million ,  $1.7 million  and  $2.6 million  in fiscal  2017 , fiscal  2016  and fiscal  2015 , respectively, due to our Lextar investment. Interest income, net .   Interest income, net  was  $3.7 million ,  $4.5 million  and  $9.1 million  in fiscal  2017 , fiscal  2016  and fiscal  2015 , respectively. The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal  2017  compared to fiscal  2016  was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields. The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal  2016  compared to fiscal  2015  was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields. Foreign currency gain (loss), net .  Foreign currency gain (loss), net  consisted primarily of remeasurement adjustments resulting from our Lextar investment and consolidating our international subsidiaries. The foreign currency gain, net in fiscal  2017  was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate between both the Chinese Yuan and the Euro and the United States Dollar which was partially offset by an unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment. The foreign currency loss, net in fiscal  2016  was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Chinese Yuan and the United States Dollar. The foreign currency gain, net for fiscal  2015  was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Euro and the United States Dollar. Other, net .  Other, net was  $200 thousand ,  $457 thousand  and  $572 thousand  in fiscal  2017 , fiscal  2016  and fiscal  2015 , respectively.  Income Tax Expense (Benefit) The following table sets forth our income tax expense (benefit) in dollars and our effective tax rate (in thousands, except percentages):   Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 25,  2017   June 26,  2016   June 28,  2015   2016 to 2017   2015 to 2016 Income tax expense (benefit) $93,454   ($1,970 )   ($19,247 )   95,424   (4,844 )%   17,277   (90 )% Effective tax rate (2,004 )%   8 %   23 %                 We recognized income tax expense of  $93.5 million  in fiscal  2017  as compared to income tax benefit of  $2.0 million  in fiscal  2016 . The decrease in the effective tax rate from  8%  in fiscal  2016  to  (2,004)%  in fiscal  2017  was due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets and other deferred charges in a period of a pre-tax loss, as discussed more fully in Note 12 “Income Taxes” to our audited financial statements in Part II, Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. We have entered into operating leases primarily for certain of our U.S. and international facilities in the normal course of business. Future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of  June 25, 2017  are detailed above in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the section entitled “Contractual Obligations.” Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the application of U.S. GAAP, we are required to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the accounting estimates from period to period are reasonably likely to occur. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition, product warranty obligations, valuation of inventories, tax related contingencies, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, other contingencies and litigation, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, including expected trends that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note  2 , “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note  2 , “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
