Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and           Results of Operations  All statements, trend analysis and other information contained in the following discussion relative to markets for our products and trends in revenue, gross margins, and anticipated expense levels, as well as other statements, including words such as "may," "will," "anticipate," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," and "intend" and other similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to business, economic and other risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in "Certain Business Risks and Uncertainties" in Item 1 of this report, as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this report.  Business Overview  We are the world leaders in developing and manufacturing compound semiconductor materials and electronic devices made from SiC and a leading developer and manufacturer of optoelectronic and electronic devices made from GaN and related materials on SiC substrates. We derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of near ultra-violet, or UV, blue and green light emitting diodes or LEDs. We currently offer LEDs at three brightness levels:       -    XBright(TM)UV, blue and green products;       -    mid-brightness UV, blue and green products, which include           MegaBright(TM), UltraBright(TM) and high brightness InGaN devices; and       -    standard brightness blue products.  Our LED devices are utilized by end users as a lighting source for wireless handsets, automotive dashboard lighting, indicator lamps, miniature white lights, indoor and outdoor full color displays and signs, traffic signals and other lighting applications. We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment in accordance with the terms of the relevant contract. When our inventory is maintained at a consigned location, revenue is recognized when our customer pulls products for their use. LED products represented 58% of our revenue in fiscal 2002 and 65% in fiscal 2001.  During fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, approximately 16% and 11%, respectively, of our revenue came from the sales of RF and microwave devices from our Cree Microwave segment. These RF power transistors are the semiconductor content for power amplifiers that are used in base stations for cellular networks. We also derive revenue from the sale of advanced materials made from SiC that are used for manufacturing LEDs and power devices by our customers, or for research and development for new semiconductor applications. Sales of SiC material products represented 13% of our revenue in fiscal 2002 and approximately 14% during fiscal 2001. We received no significant revenues from sales of power devices or SiC based RF devices in fiscal 2002 or fiscal 2001.  The balance of our revenue, 12% for fiscal 2002 and 10% in fiscal 2001 is derived from contract funding. Under various programs, U.S. Government entities further the development of our technology by funding our research and development efforts. Contract revenue includes funding for direct research and development costs and a portion of our general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses for contracts under which we expect funding to exceed direct costs over the life of the contract. For contracts under which we anticipate that direct costs will exceed amounts to be funded over the life of                                        -33-    the contract, we report direct costs as research and development expenses with related reimbursements recorded as an offset to those expenses.  Fiscal 2002 Overview  We completed the introduction of our MegaBright(TM) LED line during fiscal 2002 with the commercial release of three new products: the MegaBright(TM) UV device, the traffic signal green device and the true green device used for display signs and other lighting applications. The MegaBright(TM) blue device was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The UV device offers an alternative path to white light compared to the MegaBright(TM) blue LED. Some customers prefer a blue LED covered with a yellow-emitting phosphor to create white light. Other customers believe the UV LED with red, green and blue-emitting phosphors provides a preferable white light emission. Combining a red, green and blue LED, or a blue and yellow LED, in an appropriate package are other means of creating white light solid state lamps. A traffic signal made of green LEDs offers lower power consumption at 6-12 watts versus 85-150 watts for an incandescent bulb in certain cases. Consequently, municipalities and other government organizations are choosing to install LED traffic signals due to reduced energy consumption resulting in lower electricity bills and reduced maintenance costs due to the longer lifetimes of LEDs. Applications for the true green device target full color indoor and outdoor video displays including sports stadiums and large advertising panels. The use of blue and green LEDs in full-color outdoor signs is a well-established market, and one of the primary applications for nitride LEDs. The MegaBright(TM) product line was an important revenue stream for fiscal 2002 and has replaced some demand for our older high brightness products. Our high brightness product line had the biggest percentage decline in revenue compared to fiscal 2001. For fiscal 2003, we will combine results for our MegaBright(TM), UltraBright(TM) and high brightness devices for reporting purposes and reflect these sales as our mid-brightness products. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, our mid-brightness chips comprised 88% of LED sales.  We also introduced the XBright(TM) family of LEDs during fiscal 2002. This new product family delivers to our customers increased brightness by approximately 40 percent over the MegaBright(TM) family of LEDs. Target applications for the XBright(TM) devices include miniature white lights, traffic signals and video screens. The XBright(TM) LED technology incorporates a flip chip design and utilizes the optical benefits of SiC while maintaining the vertical structure advantages of a single top contact. This allows for a standard size chip similar to our other devices. We offer a complete product family of XBright(TM) LEDs: UV, blue, traffic green and true green. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we continued to work through packaging difficulties encountered by some of our customers in using our XBright(TM) products. As a result, XBright(TM) LEDs comprised only 1% of LED revenue in the quarter. We modified the chip after its initial introduction in response to customer packaging suggestions, and we target to increase the sales volume of this product in the first half of fiscal 2003. Customer interest in the product remains strong, as we believe the XBright(TM) chip is the brightest (which is defined as the optical power output from a chip at 20 milliamps of drive current based on our internal measurement) nitride LED currently available in the marketplace.  Shipments of our standard brightness devices remained stable in fiscal 2002 in comparison to fiscal 2001 and were supported by automotive and indicator light designs. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, standard brightness products were approximately 11% of LED revenue.  Revenue from Cree Microwave was $24.8 million during fiscal 2002. Our biggest challenge for Cree Microwave will be to diversify our Spectrian-concentrated business. However, due to the weak economic environment for microwave devices and the long qualification process for our products, we believe that this diversification will develop over many quarters. In the near term, our goal is to complete qualification of the new laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor, or LDMOS 8 products during the                                        -34-    first quarter of fiscal 2003. If we fail to attain this goal, revenue from this segment will likely decline in future quarters. Our Supply Agreement with Spectrian, Cree Microwave's largest customer, allows the customer to reduce its purchase obligations significantly.  Overall, for fiscal 2002, materials revenue declined 19% over the prior year due to a 57% reduction in gemstone sales and a 6% decrease in wafer sales. Sales of material for use in gemstones were lower in the current year as Charles & Colvard, or C&C, our sole customer for such materials, had built up inventory in fiscal 2001 as their sales slowed. During fiscal 2002, wafer volume for our material sales increased 8% while average sales prices declined 12% year over year due to greater sales to volume customers using our product for commercial applications.  Government contract revenue increased 9% in fiscal 2002 over the prior year as we received several new contract awards during fiscal 2002. Our government contract backlog exceeds $51.0 million as of June 30, 2002, and we target contract revenue to increase during fiscal 2003 due to these new awards, subject to the government's ability to terminate or reduce funding under the contracts.  During the past year, we utilized a greater proportion of our equipment and infrastructure to perform research and development work to support the commercialization of new products as reflected in the introduction of our MegaBright(TM) and XBright(TM) products. We believe that, over the next several quarters, this production capacity will be required to support the growth in demand generated by our customers' recent design wins incorporating our products. During fiscal 2003, we target to increase our throughput, subject to the acceptance of our products by our customers and market conditions. As volume throughput rises, our cost of LED chips and unit wafer costs are anticipated to decline as fixed costs are spread over more units.  Critical Accounting Policies.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing our financial statements, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Critical accounting policies include those policies that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, which potentially could produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill. We have approximately $330.3 million of long-lived assets as of June 30, 2002, including approximately $211.7 million related to fixed assets and $64.2 million in long-term investments held to maturity. In addition to the original cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number of our policy elections, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and in 2002, impairment charges. In accordance with SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of", or SFAS 121, we record impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets have been impaired. In making these determinations, the Company utilizes certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimations of the fair market value of the assets, and (ii) estimations of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service the asset will be used in the Company's operations                                        -35-    and estimated salvage values. During 2002, we determined certain property and equipment was impaired under SFAS 121 and as a result, we recorded impairment charges of $19.0 million.  In addition, during the third quarter of 2002, we completed an impairment analysis of the intangible assets and goodwill related to the acquisition of Cree Microwave. This analysis was performed due to significant changes in business conditions at the operating segment. First, Cree Microwave amended its supply agreement with Spectrian effective March 31, 2002, which resulted in a significant reduction in quarterly revenue expectations. In addition, Cree Microwave's outlook for acquiring additional customers in the near term weakened due to the deteriorating economic conditions and long product qualification cycles. Also, many of the products that Spectrian indicated it would purchase in the future have not yet been released to production. Under the amended supply agreement, if Cree Microwave is not able to produce LDMOS 8 devices qualified for Spectrian's applications in a timely manner, revenue from Spectrian may be significantly reduced after the June 2002 quarter. As a result of this impairment analysis, the remaining balance of intangible assets and goodwill of $76.5 million was deemed fully impaired and was written off.  Accounting for Marketable and Non-Marketable Equity Securities. We classify our marketable securities that are not trading or "held-to-maturity" securities as "available-for-sale". We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices, and unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are recognized when realized upon sale or disposition or when declines in value are deemed to be other than temporary in accordance with SFAS 115 "Accounting for Certain Debt and Equity Securities". We have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an "other-than-temporary" decline in fair value. Our policy requires, among other things, a review of each of the companies' cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance, liquidity, ability to raise capital and management/ownership. Based on this review, if we believe that an "other-than-temporary" decline exists in the value of one of our marketable equity securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value. The related write-down will then be recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations. During 2002, we recorded an "other-than-temporary" investment loss of $22.0 million related to our available-for-sale marketable securities based primarily on sustained reductions in stock price performance.  We also make strategic investments in the equity of privately held companies. Since we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of these companies, these investment balances are carried at cost and accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Since the shares of stock we received in these investments are not publicly traded, there is no established market for these securities. We have a policy in place to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of such investments. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes, and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that we request from the privately held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. public companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of an investment is at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record a write-down of the investment. This write-down is estimated based on the information described above, and it is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations. During 2002, we recorded a write-down on these investments of $20.4 million, representing our best estimate of "other-than-temporary" declines in value based on a review of those factors described above. Estimating the fair value of non-marketable                                        -36-    investments in early-stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations.  Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. We evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities, impairment of value and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers, sales team and management estimates. We generally reserve for inventories on hand that are greater than twelve months old, unless there is an identified need for the inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand, manufacturing process changes that result in existing inventory obsolescence or new product introductions, which eliminate demand for existing products. Remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our manufacturing cost or market value. If future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. We evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly. In the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded a $4.5 million reserve at our Cree Microwave segment for non-LDMOS and older LDMOS devices as a result of contract negotiations with Spectrian that identified these devices as obsolete. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded inventory write-downs of $690,000 related to our initial shipments of the XBright(TM) family of products due to a packaging issue identified by some of our customers.  Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable. Revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, such as when a purchase order or contract is received from the customer, the price is fixed, title to the goods has changed and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. We obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment. In some cases our inventory is maintained at a consigned location, in that situation, revenue is recognized as our customer pulls inventory for their use. We provide our customers with a limited right of return. Revenue is recognized at shipment or when product is pulled from consigned inventory, and we record a reserve for sales returns. We make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue. We analyze historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns. Significant judgments and estimates made by management are used in connection with establishing the allowance for sales returns. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates. The allowance for sales returns at June 30, 2002 was $455,000.  Accruals for Liabilities and Warranties. At times, we must make estimates for the amount of costs that have been incurred but not yet billed for general services, including legal and accounting fees, costs pertaining to our self-funded medical insurance, warranty costs at Cree Microwave and other expenses. Many of these expenses are estimated based on historical experience or averages and information gained directly from the service providers. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.  Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets. As of June 30, 2002, the Company had $28.5 million recorded as deferred tax assets. These assets were recorded as a result of tax benefits associated with the $143.9 million of significant charges taken in fiscal 2002. These charges were recorded for the write-off of property and equipment, the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at Cree Microwave and other charges resulting from the downturn in business and the "other than temporary" charges taken on our investments. We did not record a reserve against these deferred tax assets as we target a return to                                        -37-    profitable operations over the next several periods and target being able to use the deferred tax assets in their entirety.  The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management's judgement in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgement in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K which contain a discussion of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Results of Operations  The following table shows our consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:                                                                                 Years Ended                                                        --------------------------------------------------------                                                          June 30, 2002       June 24, 2001      June 25, 2000                                                        ----------------     ---------------    ----------------        Revenue:      Product revenue, net ................                    87.6%               90.0%               89.1%      Contract revenue, net ...............                    12.4                10.0                10.9                                                        ----------------     ---------------    ----------------          Total revenue ...................                   100.0               100.0               100.0  Cost of Revenue:      Product revenue, net ................                    50.3                43.3                40.0      Contract revenue, net ...............                     8.9                 7.3                 8.2                                                        ----------------     ---------------    ----------------          Total cost of revenue ...........                    59.2                50.6                48.2                                                        ----------------     ---------------    ---------------- Gross margin .............................                    40.8                49.4                51.8  Operating expenses:      Research and development ............                    18.0                 7.3                 6.5      Sales, general and administrative ...                    16.5                10.2                10.2      Intangible asset amortization .......                     4.4                 2.6                  --      In-process research and development         costs ............................                      --                 9.8                  --      Other expense .......................                    62.6                  --                 1.2                                                        ----------------     ---------------    ---------------- (Loss) income from operations ............

Revenue declined 12% to $155.4 million in fiscal 2002 from $177.2 million in fiscal 2001. This decrease was attributable to lower product revenue, which declined 15% to $136.2 million in fiscal 2002 from $159.5 million in fiscal 2001. Excluding results of Cree Microwave, due to its mid-year acquisition in fiscal 2001, revenue for fiscal 2002 would have decreased 17% over the prior year comparative results. Much of the decrease in revenue from our traditional business resulted from lower average selling prices for our LED and SiC wafer products.  Average LED sales prices declined 24% for the twelve months ended June 2002 compared to the prior year. This decrease was related to contractual volume discounts given to customers and increasing price competitiveness in the marketplace due to weakness in the worldwide economy. We believe that the overall demand for nitride LEDs declined during our fiscal 2002. However, our overall market share has recently increased as a result of our lower pricing and the introduction of higher brightness products. For fiscal 2002, our LED chip volume increased 5% over prior year shipments. The introduction of the MegaBright(TM) UV, blue, and green products in fiscal 2002 has generated new design wins for our customers. The MegaBright(TM) product is approximately two times brighter than our previous generation devices and is similar to the brightness that is currently offered by our primary competitors. Prior to the introduction of the MegaBright(TM) product line, our products were not as bright as those offered by our competition. The MegaBright(TM) product line was not fully introduced until February 2002, when our green devices were released. These products have replaced some existing demand for our previous generation high brightness devices; however, due to the product's higher performance, it has also generated new demand, particularly in the mobile handset market. We believe that volume shipments of the MegaBright(TM) product will increase in fiscal 2003 due to new design wins primarily in the mobile handset market. Several large wireless phone manufacturers have recently introduced new products that feature a blue backlight of the keypad and, at times, a blue color for the display. In addition, newer designs now offer white backlighting for full color screens that require white LEDs. We believe that our products are featured in several of these models of phones, and blue and white backlit phones have grown significantly as a percentage of handsets currently offered by major manufacturers. We also believe that the blue and white LEDs have replaced a portion of the yellow-green LEDs that have traditionally backlit mobile handsets. Our products will also target new automotive designs in fiscal 2003 as well as other consumer product applications.  During fiscal 2002, we also introduced our new XBright(TM) families of LEDs, including UV, blue and green devices. These products offer approximately 40% higher brightness than our MegaBright(TM) products, and we believe they are currently the highest brightness UV, blue and green products available in the market place. We completed the introduction of these devices in the second half of fiscal 2002. These devices did not contribute significantly to revenue in fiscal 2002, as we continue to work with customers to optimize our chip design in packaged solutions. We are targeting these products to be more significant to revenue in fiscal 2003 for high brightness applications such as display signs, traffic signals and lighting applications.                                        -39-    Shipments of our standard brightness products were flat in fiscal 2002 in comparison to the prior year due to stable demand for automotive and indicator light applications. We target that our LED revenue may grow significantly in our first quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, due to increased volume shipments. We also believe that average sales prices for LEDs will decline in fiscal 2003. However, we are targeting unit shipments to grow at a faster rate than average sales price declines, and as a result, we target higher revenue in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002. LED revenue visibility beyond the first quarter of fiscal 2003 is limited due to short lead times given to us by customers. In addition, we must complete additional improvements to our chip design and performance in order to succeed with our LED revenue targets for fiscal 2003.  Revenue from Cree Microwave increased 29% to $24.8 million in fiscal 2002 from $19.2 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in revenue represents an additional six months of sales for the segment due to our mid-year acquisition of Cree Microwave from Spectrian in fiscal 2001. Our average quarterly revenue in fiscal 2002 was lower than fiscal 2001 due to the current market environment for wireless infrastructure spending. Product mix shifted to LDMOS during fiscal 2002, which comprised 54% of microwave revenue, an increase of 13% from fiscal 2001. Revenue attributable to bipolar devices was 45% and 1% related to other products during fiscal 2002. Over 90% of Cree Microwave revenues were derived from shipments to Spectrian in fiscal 2002 as well as fiscal 2001. Overall, our average sales prices for this business segment were fairly stable with quarterly average volume being reduced in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. Cree Microwave continues to work with Spectrian to qualify and deliver new LDMOS 8 products for next generation wireless base station applications. If we are unable to deliver qualified LDMOS 8 products to Spectrian on a timely basis, the amount of our contractual supply agreement with Spectrian may be reduced significantly. Specifically, until we complete the qualification of LDMOS 8 parts and the parts are accepted by Spectrian, we anticipate minimal revenue from this segment of our business. If our revenue is reduced substantially, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for this segment of business. We continue to work on new customer design wins; however, due to long product qualification cycles in the RF industry, progress in this area will require a longer time commitment. As a result of continued weakness in market conditions for wireless infrastructure spending, combined with a reduced supply agreement with Spectrian that calls for a remaining $16.3 million of revenue through June 2003, we target revenue from this segment to decline in fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002.  Overall, for fiscal 2002, materials revenue declined 19% over the prior year due to a 57% reduction in gemstone sales and a 6% decrease in wafer sales. SiC wafer sales decreased 6% from the prior year due to lower pricing for wafers sold to corporate and research communities, including certain customers using our wafers for commercial production. Wafer units sold increased 8%, while average sales prices declined 12% due to a higher mix of volume sales related to wafers used in commercial production. For fiscal 2003, we target wafer sales revenue to be even with fiscal 2002 results. Sales of gemstone products declined 57% during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we experienced a modest recovery in revenue from C&C and target revenue improvement from this customer during fiscal 2003.  Contract revenue received from U.S. Government agencies and non-governmental customers increased 9% during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, due to additional contract awards. We anticipate that contract revenue will increase during fiscal 2003 as a result of new contract awards received in the second half of fiscal 2002.  Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased 28% to $63.4 million in fiscal 2002 from $87.5 million in fiscal 2001. Compared to the prior year, gross margins declined from 49% to 41% of revenue. In fiscal 2002,                                        -40-    gross profit included a $5.1 million charge relating to an inventory write-off and other related costs that were recorded as a part of the downsizing of Cree Microwave's operations. Without this adjustment, gross profit and gross margin for fiscal 2002 would have been $68.5 million and 44%, respectively. Lower margins resulted from a combination of lower revenue and reduced profitability for LED and wafer products and lower profitability at Cree Microwave related to weak demand for RF devices. LED margins declined due to average sales prices decreasing at a faster rate than average costs. During fiscal 2002, LED average sales prices declined 24%, which was in line with our plans, while costs were only 16% lower. LED costs did not decline as quickly as revenue due to reduced worldwide demand for UV, blue and green LED products, which put pressure on average sales prices and lowered our factory throughput. Because a significant portion of our factory cost is fixed, lower throughput typically results in higher costs per unit produced. In addition, our LED costs per unit were higher due to inefficiencies typically associated with new product introductions as we released both the MegaBright(TM) and XBright(TM) family of products during the year. In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we had product returns and inventory write-downs that netted to a $948,000 reduction in gross profit related to packaging issues identified by some customers after the release of the XBright(TM) family of products. We have redesigned our XBright(TM) chips and are planning to manufacture the products in volume in the first half of fiscal 2003. Despite the lower throughput of volume and new product inefficiencies, we were still able to reduce LED costs by 16% due to improved yield, cost cutting measures and other efficiencies.  Gross margins at Cree Microwave were 19% during fiscal 2002 and were impacted by the $5.1 million write-off of inventory discussed above. Excluding this write down, gross margin would have been 40% of revenue for the Cree Microwave segment compared to 44% in fiscal 2001. Low factory throughput due to reduced sales volumes and the qualification of LDMOS 8 has significantly impacted our cost per unit. Our greatest opportunity to improve margins would be in yield improvements and the achievement of greater throughput levels in our factory.  For fiscal 2003, we target gross margins to improve slightly as a result of higher throughput in our Durham, North Carolina facility as well as improved yields due to higher anticipated volume. Depending on our success with the introduction of the LDMOS 8 devices at Cree Microwave, our margins for that segment may increase, remain stable or may decline.  Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased 116% in fiscal 2002 to $28.0 million from $13.0 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in research and development spending supported our MegaBright(TM) and XBright(TM) product lines; our large chip LED devices as well as new higher brightness LED research programs. In addition, we funded development of our next generation LDMOS, SiC and GaN microwave devices, our Schottky diode power program and our UV lasers. While research and development spending increased, customer support of certain programs decreased, thereby further increasing costs. Finally, the mid-year acquisition of Cree Microwave during fiscal 2001 also contributed to the higher spending variance. Without the impact of Cree Microwave, research and development spending would have increased 99% over the prior year. We believe our research and development during fiscal 2002 is critical to our future revenue growth. For example, we target that more than 70% of our revenue goal for fiscal 2003 will be met with technology developed in fiscal 2002. We believe that internal funding for the development of new products will stabilize during fiscal 2003.  Sales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 41% in fiscal 2002 to $25.6 million from $18.1 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in expenses was due mostly to costs associated with ongoing intellectual property litigation. In addition, costs were higher due to the mid year acquisition of Cree Microwave during fiscal 2001, higher premiums for directors' and officers' insurance and greater spending to support the growth of the business. Without the impact of Cree                                        -41-    Microwave, sales and general and administrative expenses would have increased by 38% year over year. For fiscal 2003, we target that sales, general and administrative costs to remain stable depending on developments in our ongoing patent litigation.  Intangible Asset Amortization and In-Process Research and Development Costs. Intangible asset amortization increased 49% to $6.8 million during fiscal 2002 from $4.5 million during fiscal 2001. Nine months of intangible asset amortization was included in fiscal 2002 and six months of amortization was included in fiscal 2001 resulting from the acquisition of Cree Microwave in December 2000. Intangible asset amortization ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. An analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets indicated that the carrying values of such assets had been fully impaired under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" (SFAS 121) (see "Other Expense"). Prior to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets, we were amortizing these assets over periods ranging from five to ten years.  As a result of the acquisition of Cree Microwave in December 2000, we recorded a charge of $17.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 associated with acquired in-process research and development costs.  Other Expense. Other expense increased to $97.2 million during fiscal 2002 from $62,000 in fiscal 2001. This charge was primarily made up of a $76.5 million charge for goodwill and intangible assets relating to Cree Microwave in response to several impairment indicators. Cree Microwave amended its supply agreement with Spectrian in the third quarter of fiscal 2002, which reduced quarterly revenue expectations. Also, many of the products that Spectrian indicated that it would purchase in the future have not yet been released to production. Under the amended supply agreement with Spectrian, if Cree Microwave is not able to produce LDMOS 8 devices in a timely manner, revenue from Spectrian may be significantly reduced after the June 2002 quarter. In addition, the outlook for acquiring additional customers in the near term has decreased due to the weakened economy and the long qualification cycles. Due to the change in outlook for business at Cree Microwave and the reduction in expected revenue per quarter, we performed an asset impairment analysis under SFAS 121. As a result of this analysis, the full amount of goodwill and intangible assets of $76.5 million was written off and recorded as other expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Also included in other expense was $875,000 related to severance payments and other expenses related to the downsizing in the Cree Microwave business. In addition, a $19.0 million write-off of property and equipment was recorded to reflect changes in technology that resulted in their obsolescence.  Other Non-Operating (Loss) Income. Other non-operating (loss) income was a loss of $41.8 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $82,000 of income in fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2002 loss was attributable to a $42.4 million write-down of investments made in publicly traded and privately held equity securities. For publicly traded securities, we reclassified other comprehensive losses from equity to non-operating losses in our consolidated statements of operations and recorded additional write-downs for the "other-than-temporary" declines in the market value of these investments as the stock market has sustained significant declines in value. In the case of privately held investments, many of the companies were experiencing deteriorating financial conditions and/or an inability to raise additional capital, which represented significant indicators of value impairment. The fiscal 2002 other non-operating loss was partially offset by a $558,000 gain on the sale of marketable securities during the second quarter of fiscal 2002.  During fiscal 2001, a $4.6 million write-down was taken to establish a reserve for investments made in privately held companies that were considered to have an "other than temporary" impairment to value. In                                        -42-    addition, we made a one-time pledge of a charitable contribution of $1.2 million to the University of California at Santa Barbara to endow a Cree chair in solid state lighting and displays and for other uses. Finally, a $100,000 charge was recorded related to one-time charges for expenses incurred for the acquisition of Nitres. These charges were offset by a $6.0 million gain on the sale of marketable securities during the year.  Interest Income, net. Interest income, net has decreased 64% to $5.7 million in fiscal 2002 from $15.7 million in fiscal 2001 due to significantly lower interest rates available in fiscal 2002. In addition, slightly lower cash amounts were available as $20.3 million was used to repurchase our own stock during fiscal 2002.  Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. Income tax (benefit) expense for fiscal 2002 was a benefit of $28.7 million compared to an expense of $22.3 million in fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2002 income tax benefit resulted from significant charges of $143.9 million taken during the year. These charges included the write-off of property and equipment due to changes in technology, the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at Cree Microwave and other charges relating to the downturn in business, and an "other than temporary" decline in fair value of marketable and privately held securities. Our effective tax rate during fiscal 2002 was 22% compared to 33% in fiscal 2001. At June 30, 2002, we also maintained $28.5 million of deferred tax assets that were not reserved for by us as we target to return to profitable operations over the next several periods and target being able to use the assets in their entirety.  The minimum amount of future taxable income that will be required to realize existing deferred tax assets is approximately $66 million, $20 million of which will need to occur within the next 20 years to offset existing net operating losses. The new tax act, "The Job Creation and Workers' Assistance Act of 2002" will allow us to recover past alternative minimum tax that has been paid. This amount has been recorded as a tax receivable. The new legislation also allows us more favorable depreciation. Historically, reported taxable income has been significantly lower than income reported for financial reporting purposes. The primary reasons for this difference are the timing differences for depreciation, stock option deductions for tax purposes, other tax planning strategies, and impairment charges expensed for financial accounting purposes, which are not tax deductible.  Fiscal Years Ended June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000  Revenue. Revenue grew 63% to $177.2 million in fiscal 2001 from $108.6 million in fiscal 2000. This increase was attributable to higher product revenue, which rose 65% to $159.5 million in fiscal 2001 from $96.7 million in fiscal 2000. Without the acquisition of Cree Microwave in December 2000, revenue for fiscal 2001 would have increased 46% over the prior year comparative results. Much of the increase in revenue from our traditional business resulted from demand for our LED and SiC wafer products. LED chip volume increased 104% over units delivered in the prior year. The largest increase occurred as a result of the introduction of our UltraBright(TM) product line in fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2000 only our high brightness and standard brightness product lines were available for sale. Our standard brightness products also increased 65% in fiscal 2001 in terms of units shipped over the prior year due to strong demand for automotive and indicator light applications. Average LED sales prices declined 18% for the twelve months ended June 2001 compared to the prior year average due to expected contractual volume discounts given to customers.  SiC wafer sales increased 71% over the prior year due to demand from corporate and research customers, including certain customers using our wafers for commercial production. Wafer units sold increased 107%, while average sales prices declined 16% due to a higher mix of volume sales related to wafers                                        -43-    used in commercial production. Sales of gemstone products declined 63% during fiscal year 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 due to inventory reduction efforts at C&C.  Revenue from Cree Microwave was $19.2 million for fiscal 2001. This represents six months of sales for the unit as it was acquired in December 2000 and accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Since we acquired Cree Microwave in December 2000, there were no sales for this unit in fiscal 2000.  Contract revenue received from U.S. Government agencies and non-governmental customers increased 50% during fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, due to additional contract awards. Seven new contract awards were received during fiscal 2001.  Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 56% to $87.5 million in fiscal 2001 from $56.2 million in fiscal 2000. Compared to the prior year, gross margins declined from 52% to 49% of revenue. Lower margins resulted from a combination of reduced profitability for LED devices and the acquisition of Cree Microwave. LED margins declined due to average sales prices decreasing at a faster rate than average costs. During fiscal 2001 average LED costs declined 11% while average sales prices were reduced 18%. LED costs did not decline as quickly as revenue due to lower yields as a result of new product introductions and chip modifications made to our products in the second half of the year. In addition, factory throughput was reduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, which resulted in higher costs per chip. The margins for Cree Microwave averaged 44% as a percentage of revenue due to the competitive environment for LDMOS chips. Cree Microwave was 11% of total revenue in fiscal 2001.  Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased 84% in fiscal 2001 to $13.0 million from $7.1 million in fiscal 2000. Much of this increase resulted from the acquisition of Cree Microwave, as well as greater investment made for research in the RF and microwave, power and optoelectronic programs. Without the acquisition of Cree Microwave, research and development expenses would have increased 62% over the prior year.  Sales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 63% in fiscal 2001 to $18.1 million from $11.1 million in fiscal 2000. This increase in expenses is due to the acquisition of Cree Microwave and greater spending to support the overall growth of the business, as well as costs associated with ongoing intellectual property litigation. Without the acquisition of Cree Microwave, sales, general and administrative expenses would have increased 44% over the prior year.  Intangible Asset Amortization and In-Process Research and Development Costs. The purchase of Cree Microwave generated goodwill and other intangible assets, which will be amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of Cree Microwave, we recorded a one-time charge of $17.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 associated with acquired in-process research and development costs.  Other Expense. Other expense decreased 95% to $62,000 during fiscal 2001 from $1.3 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease was attributable to fewer fixed asset disposals.  Other Non-Operating Income. Other non-operating income decreased 88% to $82,000 in fiscal 2001 from $656,000 in fiscal 2000. This decrease was attributable to a $4.6 million write down taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 to establish a reserve for investments made in private companies that was considered to be an "other-than-temporary" decline in fair value. In addition, we made a one-time pledge of a charitable contribution of $1.2 million to the University of California at Santa Barbara to endow a Cree chair in solid state lighting and displays, and for other uses, in the first quarter of fiscal 2001.                                        -44-    Finally, a $100,000 charge was recorded related to one-time charges for expenses incurred for the acquisition of Nitres. These charges were offset by a $6.0 million gain on the sale of investment securities during the year. During fiscal 2000, a $4.1 million gain was recognized on the sale of securities. This gain combined with one-time proceeds from an insurance recovery of $400,000, more than offset a $3.8 million one-time charge for expenses incurred with the acquisition of Nitres.  Interest Income, net. Interest income, net has increased 67% to $15.7 million in fiscal 2001 from $9.4 million in fiscal 2000 due to higher average cash balances being available in fiscal 2001 as a result of the public stock offering completed in January 2000. Higher interest rates in fiscal 2001 also contributed to increased interest income.  Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for fiscal 2001 was $22.3 million compared to $16.3 million in fiscal 2000. This increase resulted from increased profitability during fiscal 2001 over fiscal 2000, as adjusted for the cost of in-process research and development which is non-deductible in the current period for tax purposes. Our effective tax rate during fiscal 2001 was 33% compared to 35% in fiscal 2000.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We have funded our operations to date through sales of equity, bank borrowings and from product and contract gross profits. As of June 30, 2002, we had working capital of $151.8 million, including $106.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held to maturity. As of June 30, 2002, we invested $64.2 million in long term securities held to maturity in order to receive a higher interest rate on our cash. Operating activities generated $39.1 million in fiscal 2002 compared with $74.8 million generated during fiscal 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $31.2 million increase in deferred income tax assets that was generated from the $143.9 million in pretax charges taken in fiscal 2002. Depreciation and amortization increased by $13.0 million in fiscal 2002, due to new equipment purchased primarily in fiscal 2001. Tax benefits from stock options were also $4.3 million lower in fiscal 2002. These inflows of cash were partly offset by a $2.8 million increase in inventory due to increased shipments anticipated for early fiscal 2003 and inventory being maintained at an offsite location, and a $3.8 million increase to prepaid expenses mostly for higher insurance premiums.  Cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2002 was $116.9 million. Net investments of $51.8 million were made in securities held to maturity and $13.8 million was invested in available for sale securities. $41.7 million was invested in property and equipment and in additional deposits for property and equipment. The majority of the increase in spending was due to new equipment additions to increase manufacturing capacity in our epitaxy, clean room and package and test areas. Finally, $9.1 million was invested in other long-term assets during fiscal 2002 and reflects strategic investments made in private companies.  Cash used in financing activities included common stock repurchases of 1.49 million shares of our common stock on the open market for $20.3 million or an average cost of $13.63 per share. This was partially offset by the receipt of $7.2 million for the exercise of stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase program.  We target approximately $50.0-60.0 million in capital spending for fiscal 2003. We anticipate that the majority of the expenditures will be made for new equipment and will be funded by cash from operations. We may also issue additional shares of common stock for the acquisition of complementary                                        -45-    businesses or other significant assets. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in complementary businesses and anticipate continuing to make such evaluations.    Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Quantitative Disclosures:  As of June 30, 2002, we maintain investments in equity securities that are treated for accounting purposes under SFAS 115 as "available-for-sale" securities. These investments are normally carried at fair market value based upon the quoted market price of that investment at the end of the reporting period, with net unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholder's equity. It is our policy to write down these equity investments to their market value and record the related write-down as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations when the investment has an "other-than-temporary" decline in value. At June 30, 2002, we believe that an "other-than-temporary" decline existed in our marketable equity securities and we recorded an "other-than-temporary" investment loss of $22.0 million related to our available for sale marketable securities. These investments are subject to market risk of equity price changes. Management views these stock holdings as an investment; therefore, the shares are accounted for as "available for sale" securities under SFAS 115. The fair market value of these investments as of June 30, 2002, using the closing sale price as of June 28, 2002, was $6.0 million. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the Nasdaq National Market. The Nasdaq Composite Index has shown a 72% decline over the past two years, therefore if there was a 72% adverse change in the market prices, our portfolio would decrease in value by $4.3 million.  An adverse movement of equity market prices would also have an impact on our portfolio of non-marketable strategic equity securities, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such a movement and the related underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers and private sales. At June 30, 2002, our non-marketable strategic equity securities had a carrying amount of $16.0 million.  We have invested some of the proceeds from our January 2000 public offering into high-grade corporate debt, commercial paper, government securities and other investments at fixed interest rates that vary by security. At June 30, 2002, the Company had $157.6 million invested in these securities. We currently have no debt outstanding.  Qualitative Disclosures:  Our investments in publicly traded equity securities are subject to the market risk of equity price changes. While we cannot predict or manage the future market price for such stock, management continues to evaluate our investment position on an on-going basis.                                        -46-    Item 8.
