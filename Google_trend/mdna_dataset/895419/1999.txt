These  forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  business  and economic  risks and  uncertainties,  and our actual  results of  operations  may differ  materially  from  those  contained  in the  forward-looking  statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences  include, but are not limited to, those  discussed in "Certain  Business Risks and  Uncertainties"  in Item 1 of this report,  as well as other risks and  uncertainties  referenced in this report.  OVERVIEW - --------  We are the world leaders in developing and manufacturing semiconductor materials and electronic  devices made from SiC. We recognize  product revenue at the time of  shipment  or in  accordance  with the  terms of the  relevant  contract.  We recognize the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of blue and green LED products. We offer LEDs at two brightness levels- high brightness blue and green products and standard blue  products.  Our LED devices are utilized by end users for automotive  backlighting,  LCD backlighting  (including  wireless handsets), indicator  lamps,  miniature  white  lighting,  indoor sign and arena  displays, outdoor  full  color  stadium  displays,  traffic  signals  and  other  lighting applications. LED products represented 51% of our revenue in fiscal 1999 and 48% in fiscal 1998.  We also derive  revenue from the sale of advanced  materials  made from SiC that are used  primarily for research and  development.  We also sell SiC crystals to C3, which  incorporates them in gemstone  applications.  During late fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1999, C3 purchased equipment from us, which has more than doubled the capacity for the production of crystals for C3. Sales of advanced materials made from SiC  represented  38% of our revenue in fiscal 1999 and  approximately  34% during fiscal 1998.  The  balance  of our  revenue,  11% for fiscal  1999 and 18% for fiscal  1998 is derived  from  government  contract  funding.   Under  various  programs,   U.S. Government  entities  further the development of our technology by supplementing our research and  development  efforts.  All  resulting  technology  remains our property after the completion of the contract, subject to certain license rights retained by the government. Contract revenue includes funding of direct research and development costs and a portion of our general and  administrative  expenses and other  operating  expenses for  contracts  under which we expect  funding to exceed direct costs over the life of the contract.  For contracts under which we anticipate  that direct costs will exceed  amounts to be funded over the life of the contract (i.e., certain cost-share arrangements),  we report direct costs as research and  development  expenses with related  reimbursements  recorded as an offset to those expenses.  In  June  1999,  Cree  announced  the  first  of a  family  of RF and  microwave transistor  products  made from SiC and  designed  for use in a variety of power amplification processes. A second phase of transistor products is expected to be available  in fiscal  2000.  The Company  expects  that these  products  will be marketed to a variety of amplifier  producers,  including wireless base stations and digital broadcast applications.  While distribution of samples will commence in early  fiscal  2000,  during  fiscal  2000 the  Company  believes  that these products  will be sold in  limited  quantities  as design  cycles for the target applications  are  generally  several  months.  There can be no  assurance  that customers  will be able to                                        -21-  develop applications in the near future that will require commercial  production of the  Company's RF products or that such  products  will be  successful in the market.

This increase was attributable to higher product  revenue,  which rose 53% from $34.9 million in fiscal 1998 to $53.5 million in fiscal 1999. This increase in product revenue was a result of the 62% rise in sales of our LED products and 58%  increase  in  materials  revenue in fiscal 1999  compared  to fiscal  1998, respectively.  Growth in LED volume  resulted from the  introduction of the new high brightness devices  and  improvements  in the product  design of and strong  demand for the standard  brightness  product.  While we continue  to improve our  manufacturing process  and  yields  on our  high  brightness  products,  we must  continue  to significantly  increase our production output to meet the growing demands of our customers.  We believe that our LED products are particularly  attractive to the marketplace  due to our low prices and                                        -22-  industry standard vertical  structure.  During fiscal 1999, LED volume grew 160% while average sales prices declined 38%.  We expect that in order to increase  market  demand for all of our LED products, we must continue to lower average sales prices,  although pricing is anticipated to be more stable in fiscal year 2000 than prior  years.  Historically,  we have been  successful in matching lower sales prices with lower costs.  During fiscal 2000, we plan to focus on reducing  costs through higher  production  yields and from greater  volumes as fixed costs are spread over a greater  number of units. In  September  1996,  we entered into an agreement  with Siemens  where  Siemens agreed to purchase our blue LED chips.  In December  1998,  this  agreement  was amended to provide for additional  shipments of LED products  through  September 1999  and  was  assigned  to an  indirect  subsidiary  of  Siemens,  OSRAM  Opto Semiconductors  GmbH & Co.  ("Osram"),  effective  as of January  1, 1999.  This contract calls for declining  prices based on an increase in the number of units shipped.  This pricing  structure is common with customers in the  semiconductor industry  and  prior  agreements  with  Siemens.  Siemens  (including  its Osram subsidiary)  accounted  for 37% of our revenue for fiscal 1999 and 40% in fiscal 1998. We are currently negotiating a new purchase agreement with Osram.  Our high  brightness  LED products,  which were  introduced  during fiscal 1999, continue  to be  ramped  up to  high  volume  production  in  our  manufacturing facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, revenue from high brightness products made up more than 25% of total LED revenue. We believe sales from these products will surpass our standard  brightness  product during fiscal year 2000; however,  there can be no  assurance  that the product  volume will  increase or yield improvements will be made to do so.  Revenue attributable to sales of SiC material was 58% higher in fiscal 1999 than in the same period of fiscal 1998 due to a  significant  increase in sales to C3 for gemstone  applications  and strong demand for wafer products.  During fiscal 1998, C3 was in initial stages of operation; therefore, unit sales were limited. Revenue  from sales of SiC wafers  were  higher in fiscal  1999 as  compared  to fiscal 1998, due to quality  improvements in wafers, along with the availability of the larger two-inch wafer during fiscal 1999.  During fiscal 1999, sales from our displays business declined 96% from the prior year period as we have chosen to discontinue this product line. Contract revenue received  from U.S.  Government  agencies  also  declined 14% during fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998,  as a significant  contract that funded  optoelectronic research was exhausted in early fiscal 1999. We anticipate  contract  revenue to increase  slightly  in  fiscal  2000 as  additional  contract  awards  have been received in late fiscal 1999.  Gross Profit  Gross  margin  climbed to 47% of revenue  during  fiscal 1999 as compared to 34% during fiscal 1998.  This increase is  predominantly  attributable to design and manufacturing  improvements  that  occurred  over the  past  year  resulting  in significant  reductions in cost.  With the  introduction  of the new  conductive buffer LED  technology  in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  1998,  we were able to significantly  lower  costs  of  production  due to  fewer  manufacturing  steps required with the new chip  structure and improved  yield.  During the first six months of fiscal  1998,  we  introduced a smaller LED chip size and, in December 1997, we began to fabricate  devices on a larger two-inch wafer.  During much of fiscal  1998,  we  were  still  in  the  process  of   establishing   these  new manufacturing designs and had not achieved production  efficiency.  In addition, the larger  two-inch  wafer had not been in full  production  for much of fiscal 1998; therefore, average die yields were significantly lower.                                        -23-  During fiscal 1999, margins realized on the high brightness  products were lower than those  derived  from our standard  blue LED product,  as the yield from the manufacturing process was less than our standard product.  Historically, we have experienced lower margins with many new product introductions. While we continue to make  improvements  to output and yield,  the high  brightness  products  may continue  to  pressure  margins in the short term if we are not able to meet our yield objectives.  Average wafer costs for SiC material  sales also declined 32% during fiscal 1999 over the comparative period due to more efficient processes and improved yield.  Research and Development  Research and development  expenses increased 150% in fiscal 1999 to $4.4 million from  $1.8  million  in  fiscal  1998.  Much  of this  increase  was  caused  by significantly  higher  costs  for  the  initial  development  of  the  new  high brightness  LED  products.  In May of 1999,  the company  signed a $2.6  million agreement  with MVIS for the  development of  edge-emitting  LEDs and blue laser diodes. As development costs are incurred under this contract, funding from MVIS is offset against these expenses. During fiscal 1999, approximately $0.5 million of funding from MVIS was offset against research and development  expenses.  The remaining  $2.1 million of funding is  anticipated to be applied to research and development expenses in fiscal 2000. We expect that including the offset of MVIS funds in fiscal 2000,  research and development  expenses will remain relatively stable compared to fiscal 1999 amounts.  Sales, General and Administrative  Sales, general and administrative  expenses increased 47% in fiscal 1999 to $6.1 million from $4.1 million in the fiscal 1998 due primarily to the general growth in our business.  In addition, in fiscal 1998 two insurance events were recorded that  reduced  expenses  by $0.4  million.  As a result  of the  dismissal  of a securities  class  action  lawsuit in November  1997,  we were  reimbursed  $0.2 million  for  costs  incurred  in  connection  with the  lawsuit.  Most of these expenses were  recorded in fiscal 1997. In addition,  we received a $0.2 million reimbursement  of medical  expenses due to a negotiated  cost cap in a partially self-funded insured health plan. Also as a result of our increased profitability during fiscal 1999 over fiscal 1998, the profit sharing accrual (which was based on 5% of operating  income) has grown $0.4  million.  We  anticipate  that total sales,  general and  administrative  costs will increase in connection  with the growth of our business; however, we believe that as a percentage of revenue they will remain constant or possibly decline.  Other Expense  Other  expense  increased  107% to $1.1  million  during  fiscal  1999 from $0.5 million in fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1999, we realized impairments to leasehold costs as a result of  management's  decision to move  equipment  from our leased facility to our new manufacturing  site. We also wrote-off other assets that had no future value to the Company.  These write-offs were slightly offset by income recognized under our equipment  build-out  agreement with C3. In fiscal 1998 and 1999,  we  sold  equipment  manufactured  by us to C3 at cost  plus an  overhead allocation  equivalent  to that  recognized  on our  government  contracts.  The reimbursement by C3 of actual manufacturing costs was recorded as a reduction in fixed assets,  while the overhead  allocation portion of the funds offset "Other expense."                                        -24-  Interest Income, net  Interest income,  net has increased 45% to $1.1 million in fiscal 1999 from $0.7 million in fiscal 1998 due to higher  average cash balances  being  available in fiscal 1999 as a result of a public stock offering completed in February 1999. A portion of the  proceeds  received  from the offering was used to repay all debt that was outstanding;  therefore during much of the third quarter and all of the fourth  quarter of fiscal  1999,  there was no  interest  expense  incurred.  In November 1997, we obtained a term loan from  NationsBank to fund the acquisition and construction of our manufacturing  facility in Durham, North Carolina.  Most of that interest was capitalized during fiscal 1998.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense for fiscal 1999 was $4.9 million  compared to $2.6 million in fiscal 1998. This increase resulted from increased  profitability  during fiscal 1999 over  fiscal  1998.  Our  effective  tax rate  during  fiscal  1999 was 28% compared to 29% in fiscal 1998.  FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 28, 1998 AND JUNE 30, 1997  Revenue  Revenue  increased  47% from $29.0  million in fiscal  1997 to $42.5  million in fiscal  1998. A  significant  portion of the rise was  attributable  to the 132% increase in LED volume sold  pursuant to an amendment to the purchase  agreement with Siemens. This agreement and two subsequent amendments provided $6.8 million in additional revenue in fiscal 1998 over fiscal 1997. This significant increase in volume sold was offset by a 32%  decline in our  average  sales price per LED sold.  Wafer and other materials revenue increased 110% in fiscal 1998 over fiscal 1997 due to a 29% increase in wafer volume  associated  with greater  interest in the worldwide  research community for SiC-based  products,  as well as revenues from C3. C3 activity grew as a result of the execution in July 1997 of the new supply agreement  and  development  agreement.   Revenues  for  the  displays  business increased  37% in fiscal 1998 over fiscal 1997 due to increased  interest  among customers for indoor video displays.  Contract revenue increased 17% to $7.6 million during fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal  1997,  as a result  of a change  in the mix of  funding  from  available contracts. Contracts funded for fiscal 1997 included a higher amount of proceeds recognized under two cost-share arrangements. For these arrangements,  funds are recorded  as a reduction  in research  and  development  expense  rather than as contract  revenue.  As funds  associated  with these two programs were exhausted during fiscal 1998,  we shifted our  resources to programs  under a cost-plus or catalog price  arrangement,  in which  funding is recorded as contract  revenue. Therefore contract revenue was higher in fiscal 1998 than 1997.  Included in revenue for fiscal 1997 is a one-time  license fee of $2.6  million. This  license  fee was earned  pursuant  to a License  and  Technology  Transfer Agreement  entered  into in  September  1996 with  Shin-Etsu.  Pursuant  to this agreement,  we granted  Shin-Etsu a license to use certain  epitaxial and device fabrication  process technology for the manufacture of our blue LED product.  We did not record any license fee revenue during fiscal 1998.                                        -25-  Gross Profit  Our gross profit increased 47% to $14.6 million in fiscal 1998 over fiscal 1997. Our gross  margin was 34% for both fiscal 1998 and fiscal  1997.  License  fees, which have no corresponding cost, were included in fiscal 1997 results.  Without license fee revenue, gross profit would have been $7.3 million or 28% of revenue for fiscal 1997.  The overall  increase in gross profit in fiscal 1998  resulted from higher revenue and lower LED and material costs per unit. The lower LED and wafer costs were  recognized due to higher  throughput,  which more  effectively utilized capacity and yield  efficiencies.  The greater throughput enabled us to spread fixed cost investments over a larger volume of product.  Greater yield in LED applications resulted from a combination of a new smaller die size and a new larger  two-inch  diameter  wafer and in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 1998, the introduction of the conductive buffer technology.  Yield was also higher for LED and materials due to plant  processing  efficiency and a higher quality of wafer materials used in these products.  The cost of contract  revenue has increased in fiscal 1998 over fiscal 1997, due to the change in the mix of funding from available  contracts.  Costs for fiscal 1997  included  a higher  amount of  expenses  recognized  under two  cost-share arrangements.  For  these  arrangements,  costs are  recorded  as  research  and development  expenses rather than cost of contract  revenue.  When funding under these two  contracts  was  completed in the second  quarter of fiscal 1998,  all resources were shifted to cost-plus and catalog priced contracts, where expenses are recorded as a cost of contract revenue.  Research and Development  Research and development costs decreased by 3% to approximately  $1.8 million in fiscal 1998 from approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 1997 due to a reduction in work  performed  under  two  cost-share  contracts  to  further  the blue  laser research.  These cost-share  contracts concluded during the first half of fiscal 1998.  Additionally,  research and development  costs for fiscal 1997 included a one-time  write-off  of $0.1  million for the  closure of our  Eastern  European Division, located in St. Petersburg, Russia.  Sales, General and Administrative Expenses  Sales,  general and  administrative  expenses  decreased  4% to $4.1 million for fiscal 1998 from $4.3  million in fiscal 1997 due to the receipt of two one-time insurance  payments.  As a  result  of  the  dismissal  in  November  1997  of a securities  class action lawsuit filed in October 1996, we were  reimbursed $0.2 million from our insurance carrier for costs incurred in defense of the suit. In addition,  as a result of a  negotiated  cost cap,  we  received a $0.2  million reimbursement   of  medical  expenses  that  were  incurred  under  a  partially self-funded  insured  health plan. As a percentage of revenue,  these costs have decreased to 10% in fiscal 1998 from 15% in fiscal 1997.  Other Expense  In fiscal 1998, other expenses included a net loss recorded on the write-down of leasehold  improvements,  the  disposal  of  certain  other  fixed  assets and a write-off of $66,000 for the  remaining  value of goodwill  associated  with the acquisition of the Real Color Displays subsidiary.  In addition, we entered into an  agreement  with  C3 to sell  equipment  manufactured  by us at  cost  plus a reasonable overhead  allocation.  The overhead allocation was recorded as "Other income;"  however,  the  amount  was more than  offset by  leasehold  write-offs associated  with the move to our new facility and other asset  disposals.  Other expense for fiscal  1997 was higher  than that  recorded in fiscal 1998 as large fixed  asset  write-downs                                        -26-  were recorded as the result of a physical  plant  inventory.  These  write-downs were greater than those recorded in fiscal 1998.  Interest Income, net  Interest  income,  net increased by $0.1 million in fiscal 1998 over fiscal 1997 due to higher  investable cash balances  available in fiscal 1998. Cash balances were higher in fiscal 1998 as we  generated  approximately  $12.1  million  from operations compared to approximately $6.1 million in fiscal 1997.  Income Tax Expense  Our  effective  income  tax rate  increased  to 29% for  fiscal  1998  from a 5% effective  rate during fiscal 1997. The lower rate for fiscal 1997 resulted from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  We have funded our operations to date through sales of equity,  bank  borrowings and revenue from product and contract  sales. On February 17, 1999, we completed our  public  stock  offering  and raised  approximately  $45.3  million,  net of offering  expenses and the  repayment of long-term  debt.  There were no selling shareholders. The Company expects that the majority of these funds will continue to be used to expand  facilities and equipment  capacity.  The remainder will be used for general  corporate  purposes,  including  working capital and potential acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses. The Company may also issue  additional  shares of common stock for the  acquisition of  complementary businesses or other significant  assets.  Although the Company from time to time evaluates   potential   acquisitions   of  and  investments  in  businesses  and anticipates  continuing  to make such  evaluations,  the  Company has no present commitments  or  agreements  with respect to the  acquisition  or  investment in another  business.  As of June 27, 1999, we had working capital of approximately $60.2  million,  including  $48.7  million  in cash  and  cash  equivalents  and marketable securities.  Operating  activities  generated  $19.9 million in cash during fiscal 1999. This was  attributable  primarily  to net  income of $12.7  million,  other  non-cash expenses of $7.2 million,  $3.5 million in deferred income tax benefits and $2.7 million for tax  benefits  associated  with stock  options.  These  amounts were partly offset by an increase of $6.2 million in accounts  receivable  and a $1.4 million rise in inventory.  Most of the $45.3  million of cash used in investing  activities  in fiscal 1999 was  related  to  expenditures  associated  with  the  construction  of our  new manufacturing  facility in Durham,  North  Carolina and increased  manufacturing capacity in the crystal growth,  epitaxial,  clean room and pack and test areas. The Company also  invested  $4.5 million to acquire an  investment in the common stock of MVIS.  The $50.1  million of cash  provided  by  financing  activities  in fiscal  1999 related  primarily to the receipt of $61.4 million  related to proceeds from the public stock  offering and the exercise of stock warrants and stock options from the Company's  employee stock option plan. This  significant  inflow of cash was partly offset by the $10.0  million  payoff of long term debt and a $3.2 million repurchase of common stock.  This stock was  repurchased  at an average price of $6.84 per share.  The stock warrants  exercised  were  distributed in connection with our September 1995 private  placement and have an exercise price of $13.62. As of June 27, 1999 warrants  remained  outstanding to purchase  258,000 shares; these warrants will expire in September 2000.                                        -27-  We are currently engaged in construction  activities  related to a new packaging area and the expansion of our crystal growth department.  These additions, which are expected to be completed by calendar year end, will allow us to  consolidate all  LED  and  wafer   manufacturing   facilities  to  one  site  with  improved manufacturing  capabilities.  In order to grow  existing  products  and  provide expanded  facilities for our new microwave  product line, we anticipate a second phase of expansion to facilities and  infrastructure to begin in fiscal 2000. We anticipate  total costs for these  expenses  to be between $15 and $20  million. Estimates for equipment  costs related to this  expansion also total between $15 and $20  million.  We  plan  to fund  these  capital  projects  with  internally generated cash plus cash on hand.  IMPACT OF THE YEAR 2000  State of Readiness  We have evaluated all of our internal  software,  embedded  systems and products against Year 2000 concerns and believe that our products and businesses will not be  substantially  affected by the advent of the year 2000. We have  completed a Year 2000  compliance  plan that  included four phases:  inventory,  assessment, remediation  and  testing.  A detailed  inventory of all  computers  and related systems was completed and all critical  upgrades were finished for all computers that were non-Year 2000  compliant.  All  factory-dependent  computers were also tested and are now Year 2000 compliant. The only other remaining steps include a network patch that impacts our utilities  and the  conversion of the  electronic mail system.  We do not believe that these  conversions  are business  critical. Individual software installations are also being reviewed. These remaining areas should be completed no later than September 1999.  Although we cannot  control  whether and how third parties will address the Year 2000 issue, we have now contacted  critical  vendors and suppliers and have been informed  that they have the  ability  to ensure  smooth  delivery  of  products without  disruptions  caused by Year 2000  problems.  Based on the  responses of these   vendors  to  our  survey,   we  believe  that  our  vendors  are  either substantially  Year 2000  compliant  or that any  noncompliance  will not have a material effect on our operations.  We have now received  assurances from 95% of these  vendors.  We anticipate  that the remaining  vendors also will be able to ensure delivery of product;  however, we do not expect that this assessment will be complete until September 1999.  Costs  We do not believe that the costs associated with Year 2000 compliance have had a material  adverse  effect on our  business,  results of  operations or financial condition. As of June 27, 1999, this project is substantially complete and we do not anticipate that we will incur any material costs in winding up the project.  Year 2000 Risks  Although we believe that our  planning  efforts are adequate to address our Year 2000 concerns,  there can be no assurance  that we will not experience  negative consequences  and material costs as a result of undetected  errors or defects in the technology used in our internal  systems.  Also,  there is no assurance that the systems of third parties on which we rely will be made compliant on a timely basis.  If  realized,  these  risks  could  result in an  adverse  effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.                                        -28-  We believe that our greatest risk stems from the potential non-compliance of our suppliers. We depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components  and  equipment  necessary  for  the  manufacture  of  our  products. Accordingly,  if those  suppliers  are  unable to  process or fill our orders or otherwise  interact with us because of Year 2000 problems,  we could  experience material adverse effects to our business. We are in the process of assessing the Year 2000 status of our suppliers  and are  investigating  alternate  sources of supply.  As a consequence  of our  dependence on limited  sources of supply,  we generally  maintain a significant  inventory of certain  critical  materials and require  suppliers to keep certain amounts of inventory  available for us. There can be no  assurance  that we will have  enough  materials  on hand to  continue production  without  interruption  in the  event  one or more  of our  suppliers experiences Year 2000 problems that affect its (their) ability to supply us. Any supply chain  disruptions  would affect our ability to manufacture our products, which could result in material adverse consequences to our business,  results of operations and financial condition.  Contingencies  We have not yet developed a contingency  plan to address what the Company should do if we are unable to address  the Year 2000 issue.  We expect the  contingency plan to be in place after the inquiry of vendors and customers is completed.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Quantitative Disclosures:  As of June 27, 1999,  the Company  maintains an investment in equity  securities that is treated for  accounting  purposes under SFAS 115 as "available for sale" securities.  This  investment  is carried at fair market value based upon quoted market price of that investment as of June 27, 1999,  with net unrealized  gains or losses  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported  as a separate  component  of stockholder's  equity. This investment,  which consists of common stock of MVIS, is subject to market risk of equity price  changes.  The common stock of MVIS is publicly traded on the Nasdaq National Market. The Company acquired these shares from MVIS in a private  placement and has agreed not to sell the shares until at least January 6, 2000;  however,  MVIS filed a registration  statement in August 1999 covering the Company's sale of these shares. Since the Company is currently restricted from trading these shares and management views this transaction as an investment,  the shares are  accounted for as  "available  for sale"  securities under SFAS 115.  The fair market value of this  investment  as of June 27, 1999, using the closing sale price as of June 25, 1999, was $6.1 million, representing 268,600 shares.  During fiscal 1999, the Company repaid the term loan that was  outstanding as of June 28, 1998. The Company currently has no debt outstanding, therefore, Cree is no longer subject to interest rate risk.  Qualitative Disclosures:  The  investment  in MVIS  common  stock is subject to the market  risk of equity price  changes.  While the Company  can not predict or manage the future  market price for such stock,  management  continues to evaluate its investment position on an ongoing basis.                                        -29-  Item 8.
