OVERVIEW  We are the world leader in developing and manufacturing semiconductor materials and electronic devices made from SiC and GaN. We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment or in accordance with the terms of the relevant contract. We derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of blue and green LED products. We offer LEDs at four-brightness levels- MegaBright(TM) blue and UV products, UltraBright(TM) blue and green devices, high brightness blue and green products and standard brightness blue products. Our LED devices are utilized by end users for automotive dashboard lighting, LCD backlighting, including wireless handsets and other consumer products, indicator lamps, miniature white lights, indoor sign and arena displays, outdoor full color displays, traffic signals and other lighting applications. LED products represented 65% of our revenue in fiscal 2001 and 63% in fiscal 2000.  We introduced our new MegaBright(TM) LED line in May 2001 and began to ramp production of the initial blue product in the month of June. We believe that this product offers two times the brightness of our UltraBright(TM) device and is one of the brightest blue LEDs commercially available in the world. During our fourth quarter, the MegaBright(TM) product made up 4% of LED revenue. In addition, in July 2001 we also announced the introduction of our blue MegaBright(TM) UV product. We believe that this device is the brightest nitride LED currently available in the market at 12 milliwatts of power. This product is currently available in limited quantities and we target volume production to begin in the first half of fiscal 2002. We believe that the MegaBright(TM) product line is extremely important for our revenue stream for fiscal 2002 and will likely replace some demand for our older products over time. These devices also offer a dual path to white light. Some customers prefer a blue LED covered with a yellow phosphor to create a white light emission, others believe a UV LED with a red, green, blue phosphor will emit the purest form of white light. We believe that Cree is the only company to offer both solutions at this time, although UV products are currently available for limited distribution only. We anticipate that the MegaBright(TM) products will likely benefit customers who provide outdoor displays, automotive designs, cell phones and other consumer products that require a white light source and applications targeted for solid state illumination.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, our UltraBright(TM) chips comprised 35% of LED sales. This concentration was reduced from 39% of LED revenue reported in our third quarter as some customers have switched the UltraBright(TM) device for MegaBright(TM) chips. The UltraBright(TM) products target applications including outdoor signs and traffic signals. Our high brightness chip demand remains strong as it is supported by on-going design wins including automotive, cellular phone and indoor display applications, however, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, these products had the biggest percentage decline in revenue. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we noted an increase in demand for our small chip products that are typically used in cell phones and other designs. Revenue from our standard brightness device remained stable as a percentage of LED revenue as it is supported by automotive and indicator light designs.  For the twelve months ended June 2001, average sales prices for LEDs declined 18% from the prior year twelve month average, while LED volume more than doubled over the prior year at a growth rate of 104%. For fiscal year 2002, we target that LED volume will remain relatively stable during the first half of the year due to market conditions and ramp up during the second half of the year as a result of anticipated new design wins for our MegaBright(TM) products. Cree continues to add new higher priced LED products to its portfolio. As a                                          26    27  result, we believe that average sales price declines for fiscal 2002 may be reduced from fiscal 2001, depending on customer acceptance of the products and market conditions.  We acquired UltraRF in December 2000. Revenue from UltraRF was $9.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. For the six months ended June 2001, 57% of revenue was attributed to bipolar devices, 41% was generated by LDMOS demand and 2% was related to other products. Over 90% of this revenue shipped to Spectrian. The biggest challenge for UltraRF during fiscal 2002 will be to diversify our Spectrian concentrated business. We believe the LDMOS product line will enable growth of our products to customers other than Spectrian and we target the UltraRF business to remain relatively stable during fiscal 2002 at approximately 20-30% of total revenue. RF and microwave business was 11% of total revenue during fiscal 2001.  We also derive revenue from the sale of advanced materials made from SiC that are used for manufacturing LEDs and power devices by our customers or for research and development for new semiconductor applications. During fiscal 2001, wafer volume grew 107% over the prior year. Strong demand from corporate and research communities are driving this growth. We also sell SiC crystals to C&C, which incorporates them in gemstone applications. Overall, for fiscal 2001, materials revenue declined 10% over the prior year due to a 63% reduction in gemstone sales, which was nearly offset by a 71% increase in wafer sales. Sales of SiC materials products and SiC crystals represented 14% of our revenue in fiscal 2001 and approximately 26% during fiscal 2000.  The balance of our revenue, 10% for fiscal 2001 and 11% for fiscal 2000, is derived from government and customer contract funding. Under various programs, U.S. Government entities further the development of our technology by funding our research and development efforts. All resulting technology remains our property after the completion of the contract, subject to certain license rights retained by the government. Contract revenue includes funding of direct research and development costs and a portion of our general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses for contracts under which we expect funding to exceed direct costs over the life of the contract. For contracts under which we anticipate that direct costs will exceed amounts to be funded over the life of the contract, we report direct costs as research and development expenses with related reimbursements recorded as an offset to those expenses.  We continue to focus on cost reduction and process yield improvements as some of our highest priorities. During the past twelve months, we maximized our capacity and have invested in additional plant and equipment and other infrastructure that has increased our overall cost base. We anticipate that we will use much of this equipment and infrastructure in the near term to perform research and development work to support the commercialization and growth of future products. We believe that a successful cost reduction program will be critical to meet our profit objectives over the next several quarters. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, our gross margins declined to 43% of revenue. This was caused primarily by reduced revenue combined with higher fixed costs and lower throughput as production levels declined due to demand and inventory optimization. Since a significant portion of our factory cost is fixed, our greatest opportunity to improve margins would be in yield improvements and the achievement of greater throughput levels. During fiscal 2002, we target to increase our throughput each sequential quarter, subject to the acceptance of our products by our customers and market conditions. As volume throughput rises, our cost of LED chips and wafers per unit are anticipated to decline as fixed costs are spread over more units.                                          27    28  The following table shows our statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:                                                                      YEARS ENDED                                                       ------------------------------------                                                       JUNE 24,      JUNE 25,      JUNE 27,                                                         2001          2000          1999                                                       --------      --------      --------        Revenue:   Product revenue, net..........................        90.0%         89.1%         85.7%   Contract revenue, net.........................        10.0          10.9          14.3                                                        -----         -----         -----           Total revenue.........................       100.0         100.0         100.0 Cost of Revenue:   Product revenue, net..........................        43.3          40.0          43.2   Contract revenue, net.........................         7.3           8.2          11.5                                                        -----         -----         -----           Total cost of revenue.................        50.6          48.2          54.7                                                        -----         -----         ----- Gross margin....................................        49.4          51.8          45.3 Operating expenses:   Research and development......................         7.3           6.5           7.1   Sales, general and administrative.............        10.2          10.2          10.4   Intangible asset amortization.................         2.6            --            --   In-process research and development costs,      one-time charge............................         9.8            --            --   Other expense.................................          --           1.2           1.9                                                        -----         -----         -----   Income from operations........................        19.5          33.9          25.9 Other non-operating income......................          --           0.6           0.2 Interest income, net............................         8.8           8.6           1.7                                                        -----         -----         -----   Income before income taxes....................        28.3          43.1          27.8 Income tax expense..............................        12.6          15.0           7.8                                                        -----         -----         -----   Net income....................................        15.7%         28.1%         20.0%                                                        =====         =====         =====   FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 24, 2001 AND JUNE 25, 2000  Revenue  Revenue grew 63% to $177.2 million in fiscal 2001 from $108.6 million in fiscal 2000. This increase was attributable to higher product revenue, which rose 65% to $159.5 million in fiscal 2001 from $96.7 million in fiscal 2000. Without the acquisition of UltraRF in December 2000, revenue for fiscal 2001 would have increased 46% over the prior year comparative results. Much of the increase in revenue from our traditional business resulted from demand for our LED and SiC wafer products. LED chip volume increased 104% over units delivered in the prior year. The largest increase occurred as a result of the introduction of our UltraBright(TM) product line in fiscal 2001. The MegaBright(TM) product, introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, offers two times the brightness of our UltraBright(TM) device, while the UltraBright(TM) chips provide two times the brightness of our high brightness products. During fiscal 2000 only our high brightness and standard brightness product lines were available for sale. Our standard brightness products also increased 65% in terms of units shipped over the prior year due to strong demand for automotive and indicator light applications. Average LED sales prices declined 18% for the twelve months ended June 2001 compared to the prior year average due to expected contractual volume discounts given to customers.  SiC wafer sales increased 71% over the prior year due to demand from corporate and research communities, including certain customers using our wafers for commercial production. Wafer units sold increased 107%, while average sales prices declined 16% due to a higher mix of volume sales related to wafers used in commercial production. Sales of gemstone products declined 63% during fiscal year 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 due to on going inventory reduction efforts at C&C. We anticipate little to no revenue from this customer over the next several quarters.                                          28    29  Revenue from UltraRF was $19.2 million for fiscal 2001. This represents six months of sales for the unit as it was acquired in December 2000 under the purchase method of accounting. UltraRF continues to ramp its production of LDMOS products currently being shipped for next generation wireless base station applications while working on new customer design wins. Since we acquired UltraRF in December 2000, there were no sales for this unit in fiscal 2000.  Contract revenue received from U.S. Government agencies and non-governmental customers increased 50% during fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, due to additional contract awards. During fiscal 2001, we received seven new contract awards.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased 56% to $87.5 million in fiscal 2001 from $56.2 million in fiscal 2000. Compared to the prior year, gross margins declined from 52% to 49% of revenue. Lower margins resulted from a combination of reduced profitability for LED devices and the acquisition of UltraRF. LED margins declined due to average sales prices decreasing at a faster rate than average costs. During fiscal 2001 average LED costs declined 11% while average sales prices were reduced 18%. LED costs did not drop as quickly as revenue due to lower yields than anticipated as a result of the new product introductions and chip modification made to our products in the second half of the year that we believe will improve our competitive advantage for new design wins. In addition, factory throughput was reduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, which resulted in higher costs per chip than anticipated. The margins for UltraRF's business average in the mid 40's as a percentage of revenue due to the competitive environment for LDMOS chips. UltraRF's business was 11% of total revenue in fiscal 2001. In addition, during fiscal 2001, one-time adjustments were made to UltraRF's cost of sales due to recording acquired inventory at fair value in accordance with the purchase method of accounting.  Research and Development  Research and development expenses increased 84% in fiscal 2001 to $13.0 million from $7.1 million in fiscal 2000. Much of this increase resulted from the acquisition of UltraRF, as well as greater investment made for research in the RF and microwave, power and optoelectronic programs. Without the acquisition of UltraRF, research and development expenses would have increased 62% over the prior year. We believe that internal funding for the development of new products will continue to grow during fiscal 2002 as we have several new products that we target to release to production during fiscal 2002.  Sales, General and Administrative  Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 63% in fiscal 2001 to $18.1 million from $11.1 million in fiscal 2000. This increase in expenses is due to the acquisition of UltraRF and greater spending to support the overall growth of the business, as well as costs associated with ongoing intellectual property litigation. Without the acquisition of UltraRF, sales, general and administrative expenses would have increased 44% over the prior year. In future periods, we believe that total sales, general and administrative costs will continue to increase in connection with the growth of our business and depending on the outcomes of our ongoing patent litigation.  Intangible Asset Amortization and In-Process Research and Development Costs  The purchase of UltraRF generated goodwill and other intangible assets, which will be amortized over periods ranging from five to 10 years. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of UltraRF, we recorded a one-time charge of $17.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 associated with acquired in-process research and development costs.                                          29    30  Other Expense  Other expense decreased 95% to $62,000 during fiscal 2001 from $1.3 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease was attributable to fewer losses on fixed asset disposals.  Other Non-Operating Income (Net)  Other non-operating income decreased 88% to $82,000 in fiscal 2001 from $656,000 in fiscal 2000. This decrease was attributable to a $4.6 million write down taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 to establish a reserve for investments made in private companies that was considered to be an other than temporary impairment to value. In addition, the Company made a one-time charitable contribution of $1.2 million to the University of California at Santa Barbara to endow a Cree chair in solid state lighting and displays in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Finally, a $100,000 charge was recorded related to one-time charges for expenses incurred for the acquisition of Nitres, Inc. These charges were offset by a $6.0 million gain on the sale of investment securities during the year. During fiscal 2000, a $4.1 million gain was recognized on the sale of securities. This gain combined with one-time proceeds from an insurance recovery of $400,000, more than offset a $3.8 million one-time charge for expenses incurred with the acquisition of Nitres, Inc.  Interest Income, Net  Interest income, net has increased 67% to $15.7 million in fiscal 2001 from $9.4 million in fiscal 2000 due to higher average cash balances being available in fiscal 2001 as a result of the public stock offering completed in January 2000. Higher interest rates in fiscal 2001 also contributed to increased interest income.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense for fiscal 2001 was $22.3 million compared to $16.3 million in fiscal 2000. This increase resulted from increased profitability during fiscal 2001 over fiscal 2000, as adjusted for the cost of in-process research and development which is non-deductible in the current period for tax purposes. Our effective tax rate during fiscal 2001 was 33% (exclusive of the impact of the non-deductible in-process research and development cost) compared to 35% in fiscal 2000.  FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 25, 2000 AND JUNE 27, 1999  Revenue  Revenue grew 74% to $108.6 million in fiscal 2000 from $62.4 million in fiscal 1999. This increase was attributable to higher product revenue, which rose 81% to $96.7 million in fiscal 2000 from $53.4 million in fiscal 1999. This increase in product revenue was a result of the 124% rise in sales of our LED products and a 24% increase in SiC material revenue in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, respectively. Our high brightness LED products experienced the heaviest demand. While our LED chip volume grew 78% in fiscal 2000 over units shipped in fiscal 1999, our average sales prices for LEDs have increased 26% over the prior year. The greater average sales price reflects a significant shift in mix to the higher priced high brightness LED products. During fiscal 2000, the high brightness products sold for an average sales price that was 125% higher than the standard brightness product. For fiscal 2000, more than 70% of LED sales were attributable to high brightness products. During fiscal 1999, less than 15% of LED sales were from the high brightness devices. The average sales price for the high brightness product line declined 12% in fiscal 2000 as compared to the prior year. The increase in high brightness unit volume was due to the strong demand from customers and the availability of additional capacity from our factory as a result of our facility and equipment expansion and yield improvements. Unit shipments of the high brightness product also increased due to the introduction of small-sized chips during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. The small-sized high brightness chips represented 8% of total LED volume for that quarter.                                          30    31  Revenue attributable to sales of SiC materials was 24% higher in fiscal 2000 than the same period in 1999 due to a significant increase in sales to C&C for gemstone applications and demand for wafer products. In the second quarter of fiscal 2000, C&C announced lower sales and higher inventory levels than anticipated and we agreed to allow C&C to reschedule approximately one-half of its purchase commitments from the first half of calendar 2000 to the second half of the year.  Contract revenue received from U.S. Government agencies increased 32% during fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, due to increased revenue on a microwave contract awarded in late fiscal 1999, and additional contract awards for Cree Lighting during fiscal 2000.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased 99% to $56.2 million in fiscal 2000 from $28.2 million in fiscal 1999. This increase is due primarily to the rise in LED sales volume discussed above and improved profitability. During fiscal 2000, the average sales price of high brightness and standard brightness LED products declined 12% and 21%, respectively, over the prior year. During the same comparative period, the cost of these devices declined 45% and 28%, respectively. The lower costs resulted from improved yields and greater throughput.  Profits on wafer and gemstone products have improved during fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999, due to higher quality materials being produced with greater yields. As a result, average wafer costs for SiC material sales also declined 34% during fiscal 2000 over the comparative period.  Research and Development  Research and development expenses increased 59% in fiscal 2000 to $7.1 million from $4.4 million in fiscal 1999. Much of this increase was caused by greater investments for research and development in RF and microwave and optoelectronics programs. In May of 1999, we signed a $2.6 million agreement with Microvision, Inc. or MVIS, for the development of edge-emitting LEDs and blue laser diodes. In April 2000, we amended our contract with MVIS to extend the agreement for an additional two-year period. Under the amended agreement, MVIS will fund an additional $10.0 million. As development costs are incurred under the original and amended contract, funding from MVIS is offset against these expenses. During fiscal 2000, approximately $3.1 million of funding from MVIS was offset against research and development expenses. During fiscal 1999, only $500,000 was applied to research and development expenses.  Sales, General and Administrative  Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 71% in fiscal 2000 to $11.1 million from $6.5 million in fiscal 1999 due primarily to the general growth in our business.  Other Expense  Other expense increased 11% to $1.3 million during fiscal 2000 from $1.2 million in fiscal 1999 due to higher write-downs for fixed assets during the year.  Other Non-Operating Income  Other non-operating income increased 372% to $700,000 in fiscal 2000 from $100,000 in fiscal 1999 due to greater income recognized from the sale of investment securities. During fiscal 2000, a $4.1 million gain was recognized on the sale of securities. This gain combined with one-time proceeds from an insurance recovery of $400,000, more than offset a $3.8 million one-time charge for expenses incurred with the acquisition of Nitres, Inc. In fiscal 1999, $100,000 was recognized on the sale of securities.                                          31    32  Interest Income, Net  Interest income, net increased 788% to $9.4 million in fiscal 2000 from $1.1 million in fiscal 1999 due to higher average cash balances being available in fiscal 2000 as a result of two public stock offerings completed in January 2000 and February 1999. Higher interest rates in fiscal 2000 also contributed to increased interest income. In addition, in November 1997, we obtained a $10.0 million term loan from NationsBank to fund the acquisition and construction of our manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina. The majority of the interest incurred in the first half of fiscal 1999 was expensed and was shown as an offset to "Interest income, net". This loan was repaid in the third quarter of fiscal 1999; therefore, there was no interest expense associated with this loan in fiscal 2000.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense for fiscal 2000 was $16.3 million compared to $4.9 million in fiscal 1999. This increase resulted from increased profitability during fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999. Our effective tax rate during fiscal 2000 was 35% compared to 28% in fiscal 1999 due to a reduction in the reserve for deferred tax assets.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  We have funded our operations to date through sales of equity, bank borrowings and revenue from product and contract sales. As of June 24, 2001, we had working capital of $244.2 million, including $208.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Operating activities generated $74.8 million in fiscal 2001 compared with $63.0 million generated during fiscal 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to net income and other non-cash expenses of $76.7 million, a $13.5 million benefit in deferred income taxes and a $7.0 million tax benefit associated with stock option exercises. These inflows of cash were partly offset by a $18.4 million rise in accounts receivable and a $2.0 million increase in inventory.  Cash generated by investing activities in fiscal 2001 was $3.4 million. Proceeds of $147.5 million were received from securities held to maturity while $106.2 million were invested in property and equipment and $26.9 was invested in other long-term assets. The majority of the increase in spending was due to new equipment additions to increase manufacturing capacity in our crystal growth, epitaxy, clean room and package and test areas. We are also nearing completion of a 147,000 square foot facility expansion at our production site near Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The increase in other long-term assets of $26.9 million during fiscal 2001 represents strategic investments made in private companies.  Cash used in financing activities included a common stock repurchase of 1.85 million shares of common stock on the open market for $30.7 million. In addition, we received $10.3 million for the exercise of stock options and stock warrants and $2.9 million for the expiration of put options associated with the stock repurchase program.
