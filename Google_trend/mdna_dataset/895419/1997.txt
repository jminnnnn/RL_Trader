See Item 1, Business, Risk Factors.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           For the year ended June 30, 1997 ("Fiscal 1997"), Cree posted record revenue and net income of $28,973,000 and $3,542,000 or $0.27 per share, respectively. These results reflect an increase in revenue and net income of $13,916,000 and $3,299,000, respectively over the prior year. Product revenue, which includes LED and wafer sales, module display products and Real Color Displays, Inc. ("RCD") moving message sign sales, reflect a 105% increase over fiscal 1996 results. Comparatively, product revenue also increased 62% during fiscal 1996 over 1995 amounts.           During fiscal 1997, a significant portion of the rise in product revenue was directly attributable to higher blue light-emitting diode ("LED") volume, which was prompted by the purchase agreement signed in September 1996 and amended in April 1997, with Siemens A.G. ("Siemens"). That agreement and its amendment, provided sales in excess of $8 million for fiscal 1997. As of June 30, 1997, the Company has shipped all quantities required to be shipped by that date under the terms of the agreement. The amendment to the purchase agreement provides for enhanced product specifications requested by Siemens. The specifications require that all LEDs be tested to meet a maximum rating for resistance to electrostatic discharge. In exchange for the higher grade chip, Siemens agreed to make non-cancelable all shipments scheduled through September 30, 1997. Shipments scheduled for October through December 1997, may be canceled, subject to a cancellation fee. As of June 30, 1997, approximately 25 million chips remain to be shipped under the amended contract, of which 15 million are subject to cancellation at Siemen's option. Additionally, the amendment provides for higher prices per unit on items shipped early in                                          18    the contract, with amounts being reduced as volume increases in the latter part of the contract. The higher pricing, much of which has already been recognized in fiscal 1997, was negotiated to offset increased per unit costs incurred during the third and fourth quarters of 1997 to meet enhanced specifications. Further reductions in per unit costs are required to provide a consistent profit margin on future sales and is expected from a combination of improvements made in the production process for yield, other processing efficiencies and the effective utilization of plant assets. There can be no assurance that these efficiencies will be achieved. Under the amended contract, revenues received from Siemens for shipments are also subject to certain foreign currency provisions, whereby Siemens will receive discounts if the conversion rate of the German mark to the U.S. dollar at the date of shipment has averaged 1.75 or more for the preceding thirty days. LED sales also increased by 279% in 1996 over 1995 amounts due to capacity and yield improvements made during that year.           The Company is currently focusing on obtaining additional LED customers who are interested in ordering commercial volumes of the product. If the Company is unable to expand its customer base, its revenue and earnings growth potential could be adversely impacted. The Company believes that in order to significantly grow market demand for the LED product and defray competition, it must substantially lower prices. To offer lower pricing to customers, the Company must reduce unit costs of production. The Company is currently working on two projects which it expects will reduce the unit cost per chip. The first is expected to reduce the size of each chip while continuing to use existing processes, thereby increasing the number of chips yielded per wafer. The second initiative is expected to increase the overall wafer size to a two inch diameter structure. This effort will also increase the yield per wafer, thus substantially lowering the overall cost of the LED product. The Company's goal is to complete both of these projects during the first half of fiscal 1998. While the Company's average sales price per unit for the LED product in 1997 remained consistent with 1996 levels, the price is projected to fall during 1998 as the Siemens amended purchase agreement includes a lower unit price in the second half of the contract. In addition, if the Company achieves increased volume from other customers a lower average sales price is expected. If the Company is unable to successfully manufacture the new chip structures described above, profits are anticipated to deteriorate during fiscal 1998. This situation would curtail market development and growth for the Company's LED business. The anticipated reduction in the average sales price in 1998 is expected to be offset with greater LED volume, assuming that the revised chip structure is successful.           In the middle and latter portion of fiscal 1997, material wafer sales began to experience an improved pattern of orders as the worldwide research community is gaining a better acceptance of the SiC technology, and the Company continues to make improvements to the quality of its SiC material. Accordingly, wafer sales volume increased approximately 42% over 1996 levels. In addition, the Company was able to realize a slight increase in its average sales price due to the mix of premium wafer products with low defect levels that were more readily available during 1997. Overall, wafer sales were 60% higher than 1996 amounts. During 1998, the Company expects to continue to supply wafers largely for research efforts, as customers have not yet proven the effectiveness of the product for commercial applications. During fiscal 1996, wafer sales grew 27% or $927,000 over 1995 amounts, due to additional plant capacity installed during that year.           In July 1997, the Company announced development and supply agreements with a related party, C3, Inc. ("C3"), to develop and supply bulk single crystal silicon carbide for gemstone applications. Pursuant to the development agreement, the Company has undertaken a five-year program directed to development of near-colorless single crystalline for use in gemstones as a diamond substitute. C3 will pay Cree's direct costs of the development effort, plus a percentage                                           19   margin on certain costs. Improved material resulting from the development program will be supplied to C3 under the supply agreement, which provides for prices based on Cree's production costs plus a specified margin. Material purchased by C3 under the supply agreement may be used solely for the fabrication and sale of gemstones. During fiscal 1997 and 1996, the Company sold material products to C3. Those sales were at margins consistent with those achieved in connection with sales of similar products to the Company's other customers.           Financial results for the displays product line includes sales of both modules and sign products. Revenue for the modules business increased by 76% in fiscal 1997 over prior year results due to increased volume as the product was introduced in fiscal 1996. Moving message sign sales by RCD, the Company's subsidiary, suffered a 53% decline in revenue over 1996 amounts due to a 48% decrease in volume. This reduction was prompted by a long term strategic shift in focus of the Company to the module product line, which has a longer sales lead time. The moving message sign business relies heavily on distributor and small independent customers. While the Company continues to use its best efforts to market and sell moving message signs, the modules product line is considered to be a better fit for long term initiatives, as it requires fewer resources and aligns with the distribution network of other customer partners. For fiscal 1998, the Company has reduced the number of standard product offerings in both of these businesses and will concentrate on increasing sales of these standard products. The average sales prices from both products remained consistent with 1996 levels. Revenue for the displays business grew 11% or $185,000 during fiscal 1996 from 1995 amounts due to the introduction of the modules line of business during that year.           Research contract revenue increased 66% to $6,535,000 during 1997 and 31% in fiscal 1996 from 1995 amounts. Higher revenues were generated as a result of more funding being made available from the U.S. government for certain research contracts, primarily in the areas of microwave, blue laser and basic material development. Also, additional plant capacity in both years have enabled more research to be performed by the Company.           Included in revenue for fiscal 1997, is a one-time license fee of $2,615,000. This license fee was earned pursuant to a License and Technology Transfer Agreement entered into in September 1996 with Shin-Etsu Handotai Co. Ltd. ("Shin Etsu"). Pursuant to this agreement, the Company granted Shin-Etsu a license to use certain epitaxial and device fabrication process technology for the manufacture of the Company's LED product. The license fee is payable in installments, with all funds collected as of June 30, 1997, with the exception of a $500,000 payment due on June 30, 1998. The Company also recorded an accrued expense of $186,000 payable in June 1998 to a third party that brokered the agreement. Results for fiscal 1996 include a one-time net license fee revenue of $1,423,000. This license fee was earned pursuant to a Development License and Supply Agreement entered in October 1995 with Siemens, in which the Company granted Siemens a license to use certain technology to manufacture blue and green LED products. These license agreements were entered into to allow the Company to increase interest in the GaN-on-SiC materials technology used in its LEDs in both Europe and Asia. In addition, if the licensed technology is put into commercial production by these corporate partners, it is anticipated that they will continue to purchase SiC wafer materials from the Company, although there is no contractual requirement to do so. As of August 1997, Siemens and Shin-Etsu have not begun commercial production using the licensed technology.           The Company's gross margin increased 177% to $9,878,000, or 34% of revenue for fiscal 1997. The Company's gross margin as a percentage of sales was 24% and 33% in 1996 and 1995 respectively. License fee revenue, which has no corresponding cost, is included in both 1997 and                                          20   1996 results. Without license fees, gross margins would have been $7,263,000 or 28% of revenue for fiscal 1997 and $2,145,000 or 16% of revenue for the comparative period in 1996. The overall increase in margin in 1997 stems from higher throughput, which more effectively utilized plant capacity, and yield efficiencies on LED and wafer products, which lowered the cost of production per unit. While the Company has demonstrated a lower per unit cost during 1997, much of the success was due to higher volumes processed relating to the Siemens purchase agreement. This greater throughput enabled the Company to spread fixed cost investments over a larger volume of product. Higher margins in the future are largely contingent on the Company's ability to increase the volume of LEDs produced, by gaining a larger customer base and by the successful application of the research and development projects. In addition, as a result of the anticipated decline in the average sales price to be received in 1998, to maintain competitive margins, the Company must also enhance its chip structure to allow for smaller chips and larger wafers. If the Company is unable to improve efficiency under the new chip standards or gain orders for additional volume, gross margin could be negatively impacted. Gross margin deteriorated in 1996 from 1995 levels, due to disappointing manufacturing yields and insufficient utilization of the significant investments made in additional plant capacity.           The Company benefits from research and development efforts sponsored by U.S. government contracts, corporate sponsors and internal funding. Contracts are awarded to the Company to fund both short term and long term research projects. Funding for projects with near term applications for the Company typically include a cost-share component that the Company is responsible for absorbing. Projects that may not have available production applications or require longer term development are usually awarded on a cost-plus basis with built in margins exceeding 5%.           During fiscal 1997, the Company changed its policy for reporting government contract activity. Reporting is now based on the nature of the contract. For contracts under which the Company anticipates that funding will exceed direct costs, all funding is reported as revenue and direct costs are reported as cost of revenues. For contracts under which the Company anticipates that direct costs will exceed funding, costs are reflected as research and development expenses with the related funding amounts offsetting these costs.           Research and development costs have increased by 42% to $1,826,000 in 1997 due to substantial work performed on two cost-share contracts to further the blue laser research. Net costs to the Company for these projects were $671,000 and $367,000 for 1997 and 1996, respectively. Both of these cost-share contracts will conclude during the first half of 1998. Additionally, research and development costs for 1997, include a one-time write off of $93,000 for the closure of the Company's Eastern European Division. The Eastern European Division, located in St. Petersburg, Russia, was a research group performing some of the Company's basic material and device development work.           Sales and general and administrative expenses increased 47% to $4,301,000 for the period ended June 30, 1997, compared to 1996 due to overall cost increases to support the growth of the Company. As a percentage of revenue, these costs have decreased to 15% in 1997 from 19% and 25% in 1996 and 1995, respectively. Increased costs include recruiting and salary expenses for additional sales personnel to focus the business on gaining new LED customers, the brokerage fee (a net present value of $172,000) associated with generating license fee revenue and greater legal fees in connection with the defense of the pending securities class action lawsuit (see Part I, Item 3). The Company anticipates that sales and general and administrative expenses may continue to rise in future periods as it expands sales efforts and as a result of the pending litigation.                                         21             Other (income) expense includes a net $762,000 one-time charge associated with disposal costs for fixed assets and expenses arising from abandoned patent applications. This amount was partially offset by proceeds received from an insurance settlement for lost profits associated from a temporary plant shut down that was caused by a natural disaster.           Net interest income decreased by $260,000 in 1997 over 1996 results and increased by $405,000 when comparing 1996 to 1995, due to higher investable cash balances available in fiscal 1996. The Company concluded a private equity placement in September 1995, that increased available cash in 1996.           During 1997, the Company's effective tax rate was 5%. The rate was lowered from statutory levels due to the utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. The 1997 tax provision consists primarily of Japanese foreign tax withholdings on license fee income. The Company anticipates that the effective tax rate will increase substantially in fiscal 1998 since the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards will not offset as high a percentage of projected pre tax book income.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           Net cash provided by operations reached a record $5,859,000 in 1997 compared with cash used in operations of $1,636,000 and $562,000 in 1996 and 1995, respectively. This increase was driven primarily from profitability. The increase in cash used in 1996 over 1995 amounts was caused by a significant increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances. If the Company achieves its goal of increasing customer demand and implements the two research and development projects related to reducing production costs, the Company expects that cash provided by operations will increase in 1998 and will be sufficient to fund all anticipated capital additions required.           The number of trade average days sales outstanding was reduced to 55 for 1997 from 96 and 57 days experienced in 1996 and 1995, respectively, due to a focused collections effort put forth during the year.           The Company invested $7,974,000 in capital equipment during 1997 compared to $14,740,000 and $3,486,000 spent during 1996 and 1995, respectively. Much of the 1997 plant capacity additions were made in the crystal growth and epitaxial departments. At this time, the Company anticipates additions in 1998 to be at a similar level to amounts spent in 1997 and intends to fund these additions through cash provided by operations and cash on hand. During 1996, a significant investment was made for equipment related to the production of the LED and wafer products. Additional investments were also made in the crystal growth and wafer processing areas. Financing activities provided the Company $20,924,000 during fiscal 1996. The majority of the funding was provided by the September 1995 private placement which yielded approximately $17.5 million.  OUTLOOK: ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES           Cree does not provide a forecast for future financial performance. While management is optimistic about the Company's short and long term prospects, the issues and uncertainties, described in PART I, Item 1, Business, Risk Factors, should be considered in evaluating its growth outlook.                                         22         ITEM 8.
