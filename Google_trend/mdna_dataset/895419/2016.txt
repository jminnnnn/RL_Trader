Item 7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Executive Summary The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including a brief discussion of our business and products, key factors that impacted our performance and a summary of our operating results.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.  Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods. Overview Cree, Inc. (Cree, we, our, or us) is a leading innovator of lighting-class light emitting diode (LED) products, lighting products and wide bandgap semiconductor products for power and radio-frequency (RF) applications.  Our products are targeted for applications such as indoor and outdoor lighting, video displays, transportation, electronic signs and signals, power supplies, inverters and wireless systems. Our lighting products primarily consist of LED lighting systems and bulbs.  We design, manufacture and sell lighting fixtures and lamps for the commercial, industrial and consumer markets. Our LED products consist of LED components, LED chips, and silicon carbide (SiC) materials.  Our LED products enable our customers to develop and market LED-based products for lighting, video screens and other industrial applications. In addition, we develop, manufacture and sell power and RF devices based on wide bandgap semiconductor materials such as SiC and gallium nitride (GaN).  Our power products are made from SiC and provide increased efficiency, faster switching speeds and reduced system size and weight over comparable silicon-based power devices.  Our RF devices are made from GaN and provide improved efficiency, bandwidth and frequency of operation as compared to silicon or gallium arsenide (GaAs). As discussed more fully below in “Business Outlook,” on July 13, 2016, we executed a definitive agreement to sell our Power and RF Products segment and certain related portions of our SiC materials and gemstones business included within our LED Products segment (which we collectively also refer to as our Wolfspeed business) to Infineon Technologies AG (Infineon).   The majority of our products are manufactured at our production facilities located in North Carolina, Wisconsin, and China.  We also use contract manufacturers for certain products and aspects of product fabrication, assembly and packaging.  We operate research and development facilities in North Carolina, California, Wisconsin, India, Italy and China (including Hong Kong). Cree, Inc. is a North Carolina corporation established in 1987, and our headquarters are in Durham, North Carolina.  For further information about our consolidated revenue and earnings, please see our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Reportable Segments Our  three  reportable segments are: • Lighting Products • LED Products • Power and RF Products Reportable segments are components of an entity that have separate financial data that the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews when allocating resources and assessing performance.  Our CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM does not review inter-segment transactions when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment, and inter-segment transactions are not included in our segment revenue disclosure. As such, total segment revenue is equal to our consolidated revenue. Our CODM reviews gross profit as the lowest and only level of segment profit.  As such, all items below gross profit in the Consolidated Statements of Income must be included to reconcile the consolidated gross profit to our consolidated (loss) income before income taxes. For financial results by reportable segment, please refer to Note  14 , “Reportable Segments,” in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Research and Development Research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products, enhancements of existing products and general technology research.  These costs consisted primarily of employee salaries and related compensation costs, occupancy costs, consulting costs and the cost of development equipment and supplies. The following sets forth our research and development expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):     Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 26, 2016   June 28, 2015   June 29, 2014   2015 to 2016   2014 to 2015 Research and development $168,848   $182,797   $181,382   ($13,949 )   (8 )%   $1,415   1 % Percent of revenue 10 %   11 %   11 %                 Research and development expenses decreased in fiscal  2016  to  $168.8 million  compared to  $182.8 million  in fiscal  2015 , which increased slightly from  $181.4 million  in fiscal  2014 . The decrease in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a shift in emphasis to lighting-related research and development, which is inherently less expensive than LED research and development.  Our research and development expenses vary significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, including the timing of new product introductions and the number and nature of our ongoing research and development activities.  34 Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and our executive and administrative personnel (for example, finance, human resources, information technology and legal) and consisted of salaries and related compensation costs; consulting and other professional services (such as litigation and other outside legal counsel fees, audit and other compliance costs); marketing and advertising expenses; facilities and insurance costs and travel and other costs. The following table sets forth our sales, general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):     Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 26, 2016   June 28, 2015   June 29, 2014   2015 to 2016   2014 to 2015 Sales, general and administrative $283,052   $290,730   $268,460   ($7,678 )   (3 )%   $22,270   8 % Percent of revenue 18 %   18 %   16 %                 Sales, general and administrative expenses in fiscal  2016  decreased  3%  to  $283.1 million  from  $290.7 million  in fiscal  2015 , which was an  8%  increase from  $268.5 million  in fiscal  2014 .  The decrease in fiscal  2016  compared to fiscal  2015  was primarily due to lower spending on corporate sales and marketing expenses related to lower sales, partially offset by an increase in legal fees associated with intellectual property protection and enforcement.  The increase in fiscal  2015  compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with intellectual property protection and enforcement, severance and lease termination costs pursuant to our restructuring plan, and higher spending on sales and marketing for lighting products, including commissions, trade shows and advertising, as we continued to expand our direct sales resources and channels and invested in building and promoting the Cree brand. Amortization or Impairment of Acquisition-Related Intangibles As a result of our acquisitions, we have recognized various amortizable intangible assets, including customer relationships, developed technology, non-compete agreements and trade names.  Amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):     Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 26,  2016   June 28,  2015   June 29,  2014   2015 to 2016   2014 to 2015 Customer relationships $6,374   $5,614   $7,359   $760   14  %   ($1,745 )   (24 )% Developed technology 20,321   18,642   19,446   1,679   9  %   (804 )   (4 )% Non-compete agreements 2,037   1,960   1,960   77   4  %   —   —  % Trade names, finite-lived   4   23   (4 )   (100 )%   (19 )   (83 )% Total $28,732   $26,220   $28,788   $2,512   10  %   ($2,568 )   (9 )% Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles increased in fiscal  2016  compared to fiscal  2015  primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to the APEI acquisition as discussed in Note 3, “Acquisition,” in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.  Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal  2014  primarily due to decreases in amortization expense for customer relationships and developed technology. In the fourth quarter of 2014, based on our qualitative impairment assessment of our indefinite-lived trade names, we impaired the Ruud Lighting trade name which had a book value of $3.2 million.    35 Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We operate a capital intensive business.  As such, we dispose of a certain level of our equipment in the normal course of business as our production processes change due to production improvement initiatives or product mix changes.  Due to the risk of technological obsolescence or changes in our production process, we regularly review our equipment and capitalized patent costs for possible impairment.  The following table sets forth our loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets (in thousands, except percentages):     Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 26, 2016   June 28, 2015   June 29, 2014   2015 to 2016   2014 to 2015 Loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets $16,913   $47,722   $2,690   ($30,809 )   (65 )%   $45,032   1,674 % We recognized a net loss of  $16.9 million ,  $47.7 million , and  $2.7 million  on the disposal of long-lived assets in fiscal years  2016 ,  2015 , and  2014 , respectively.  The net losses in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 were primarily due to the planned sale or abandonment of certain long-lived assets to reduce excess manufacturing capacity pursuant to our restructuring plan discussed above.  The net loss for fiscal  2014  was primarily the result of disposals of equipment due to changes in various manufacturing processes and the abandonment of certain patent assets as a result of technological obsolescence.  Non-Operating (Expense) Income, net The following table sets forth our non-operating (expense) income, net (in thousands, except percentages):     Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 26, 2016   June 28, 2015   June 29, 2014   2015 to 2016   2014 to 2015 Gain on sale of investments, net $238   $925   $68   ($687 )   (74 )%   $857   1,260  % Loss on equity method investment (15,357 )   (22,624 )   —   7,267   (32 )%   (22,624 )   — Dividends from equity method investment 1,655   2,581   —   (926 )   (36 )%   2,581   — Interest income, net 4,472   9,086   11,932   (4,614 )   (51 )%   (2,846 )   (24 )% Foreign currency (loss) gain, net (4,500 )   (929 )   45   (3,571 )   384  %   (974 )   (2,164 )% Other, net 457   572   1,250   (115 )   (20 )%   (678 )   (54 )% Non-operating (expense) income, net ($13,035 )   ($10,389 )   $13,295   ($2,646 )   25  %   ($23,684 )   (178 )% During fiscal  2016 ,  2015  and  2014  we were in a net interest income position.  Our short-term investments consisted primarily of municipal bonds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency securities, non-U.S. certificates of deposit and non-U.S. government securities.   The primary objective of our investment policy is preservation of principal.  Other long-term investments consisted of our approximately 14% common stock ownership interest in Lextar Electronics Corporation (Lextar), which was completed in December 2014.  This investment was accounted for under the equity method from the date of investment until June 2016 when we chose not to stand for re-election as a member of the Lextar board of directors. We utilize the fair value option in accounting for our investment in Lextar.   Gain on sale of investments, net .   Gain on sale of investments, net  was  $238 thousand ,  $925 thousand  and  $68 thousand  in fiscal  2016 , fiscal  2015  and fiscal 2014, respectively.  Gain on sale of investments, net decreased in fiscal  2016  primarily due to lower sales of investments. Gain on sale of investments, net increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to gains realized on the sale of investments liquidated in order to fund the repurchase of our common stock. Loss on equity method investment .   Loss on equity method investment  was  $15.4 million  in fiscal  2016  and  $22.6 million  in fiscal 2015 due to decreases in the fair value of our Lextar investment.  Lextar’s stock is publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and its share price declined from 30 New Taiwan Dollar (TWD) at the date of our investment in December 2014 to 21.55 TWD at June 28, 2015 and to 15.70 TWD at June 26, 2016. This downward stock price trend may continue in the future given the risks inherent in Lextar’s business and trends affecting the Taiwan and global equity markets.  Any future stock price declines will be recorded as further losses based on the decrease in the fair value of the investment during the applicable fiscal period, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   Dividends from equity method investment .   Dividends from equity method investment  were  $1.7 million  in fiscal  2016  and  $2.6 million  in fiscal 2015 due to our Lextar investment.   36 Interest income, net .   Interest income, net  was  $4.5 million ,  $9.1 million  and  $11.9 million  in fiscal  2016 , fiscal  2015  and fiscal 2014, respectively.  The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal  2016  compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields. The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal  2015  compared to fiscal  2014  was primarily due to earning lower investment yields and lower invested balances, partially offset by interest expense associated with our revolving line of credit. Foreign currency (loss) gain, net .    Foreign currency (loss) gain, net  consisted primarily of remeasurement adjustments resulting from our Lextar investment and consolidating our international subsidiaries. The foreign currency loss, net in fiscal  2016  was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Chinese Yuan and the United States Dollar.  The foreign currency loss, net in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Euro and the United States Dollar.  The foreign currency gain, net for fiscal  2014  was primarily due to favorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Chinese Yuan and the United States Dollar. Other, net .   Other, net was  $0.5 million ,  $0.6 million  and  $1.3 million  in fiscal  2016 , fiscal  2015  and fiscal 2014, respectively.  Other, net decreased from  $1.3 million  in fiscal  2014  to  $0.6 million  in fiscal  2015  primarily due to the receipt of a Chinese government subsidy in fiscal 2014. Income Tax (Benefit) Expense  The following table sets forth our income tax (benefit) expense in dollars and our effective tax rate (in thousands, except percentages):     Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 26,  2016   June 28,  2015   June 29,  2014   2015 to 2016   2014 to 2015 Income tax (benefit) expense  ($1,970 )   ($19,247 )   $23,041   17,277   (90 )%   (42,288 )   (184 )% Effective tax rate 8 %   23 %   16 %                 We recognized income tax benefit of  $2.0 million  in fiscal  2016  as compared to income tax benefit of  $19.2 million  in fiscal  2015 .  The decrease in the effective tax rate from  23%  in fiscal  2015  to  8%  in fiscal  2016  was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign net operating loss carryovers during fiscal 2016, which had the impact of decreasing the tax benefit realized.  The increase in the effective tax rate from  16%  in fiscal  2014  to  23%  in fiscal  2015  was primarily due to the inverse relationship that tax credits had on the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate due to the pre-tax loss, offset by a higher percentage of our pre-tax loss being derived from international operations in fiscal 2015, which are taxed at lower tax rates than U.S. operations. The variation between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of  35 percent  is due to the impact of our pre-tax income or loss relative to favorable tax rate impacts associated predominantly with our: (i) income derived from international locations with lower tax rates than the U.S. and (ii) tax credits generated, which were offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign net operating loss carryovers. Tax credits and other deductions have the impact of increasing the tax rate above the statutory rate of 35% in periods in which we report pre-tax losses as they provide a benefit recoverable in future periods. In addition, our effective tax rate may be negatively impacted by the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits (credits) that accumulate in our equity as additional paid-in-capital (APIC) and referred to as the “APIC pool” of credits.  In situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stock-based compensation awards, such as non-qualified stock options and restricted stock, are less than those originally anticipated, which accumulate in the APIC pool, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires that we recognize the difference as an increase to income tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for research and development, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments.  Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, marketable securities, cash generated from operations and availability under our line of credit.  Our ability to generate cash from operations has been one of our fundamental strengths and has provided us with substantial flexibility in meeting our operating, financing and investing needs.  We have a $500 million line of credit as discussed in Note  8 , “Long-term Debt,” in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, as discussed more fully above in “Business Outlook” and in Note 19, “Subsequent Event,” in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information. Financial and Market Risks We are exposed to financial and market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodities risk.  We have entered and may in the future enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage or hedge some of our foreign exchange rate risk.  We may not be able to engage in hedging transactions in the future, and even if we do, foreign currency fluctuations may still have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial performance.  All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial positions at  June 26, 2016  and  June 28, 2015 .  Actual results may differ materially. Interest Rates We maintain an investment portfolio principally composed of money market funds,  municipal bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit .  In order to minimize risk, our cash management policy permits us to acquire investments rated “A” grade or better.  As of  June 26, 2016  and  June 28, 2015 , our cash equivalents and short-term investments had a fair value of  $0.4 billion  and  $590.1 million , respectively.  If interest rates were to hypothetically increase by  100  basis points, the fair value of our cash equivalents and short-term investments would decrease by  $9.6 million  at  June 26, 2016  and  $9.7 million  at  June 28, 2015 .  We do not believe that a  10%  change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of  June 26, 2016 , we maintained a secured revolving line of credit under which we can borrow, repay and reborrow loans from time to time prior to its scheduled maturity date of January 9, 2020.  At  June 26, 2016  and  June 28, 2015 , we had  $160 million  and  $200 million  outstanding, respectively, under the line of credit.  If interest rates were to increase by  100  basis points, the annual interest incurred under our line of credit would have increased by  $1.6 million  at  June 26, 2016  and  $2.0 million  at  June 28, 2015 . Currency Exchange Rates Because we operate internationally and have transactions denominated in foreign currencies, including the Chinese Yuan and Euro, among others, we are exposed to currency exchange rate risks.  As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities.  Our primary exposures relate to the exchange rates between (1) the U.S. Dollar and the Chinese Yuan and (2) the U.S. Dollar and the Taiwanese Dollar.  The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Yuan was approximately  $1.0 million  at  June 26, 2016  and  $2.4 million  at  June 28, 2015 .  The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwanese Dollar was approximately $4.2 million at  June 26, 2016  and $6.0 million at  June 28, 2015 . Commodities We utilize significant amounts of precious metals, gases and other commodities in our manufacturing processes.  General economic conditions, market specific changes or other factors outside of our control may affect the pricing of these commodities.  We do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not use off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties, nor do we use any other forms of off-balance sheet arrangements.  Accordingly, our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off-balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities. As of  June 26, 2016 , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note  2 , “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
