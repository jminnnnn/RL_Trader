Item 7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Executive Summary The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including a brief discussion of our business and products, key factors that impacted our performance and a summary of our operating results. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods. Overview Cree, Inc. (Cree, we, our, or us) is an innovator of wide bandgap semiconductor products for power and radio-frequency (RF) applications, lighting-class light emitting diode (LED) products, and lighting products.

Our materials products and power devices are used in solar, electric vehicles, motor drives, power supplies and transportation applications. Our materials products and RF devices are used in military communications, radar, satellite and telecommunication applications. Our LED Products segment’s products consist of LED chips and LED components. Our LED products enable our customers to develop and market LED-based products for lighting, video screens, automotive and specialty lighting applications. Our Lighting Products segment’s products primarily consist of LED lighting systems and lamps. We design, manufacture and sell lighting fixtures and lamps for the commercial, industrial and consumer markets. As discussed more fully in Note 1, “Business,” in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, on July 13, 2016, we executed a definitive agreement to sell the Wolfspeed business to Infineon. On March 6, 2017, the definitive agreement with Infineon was terminated.  During fiscal 2018, we expanded our RF product offerings through the acquisition of certain assets of Infineon's Radio Frequency Power Business (RF Power) as discussed in Note 4, "Acquisition", in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The majority of our products are manufactured at our production facilities located in North Carolina, Wisconsin, California, Arkansas and China. We also use contract manufacturers for certain products and aspects of product fabrication, assembly and packaging. We operate research and development facilities in North Carolina, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Wisconsin, India, Italy and China (including Hong Kong). Cree, Inc. is a North Carolina corporation established in 1987, and our headquarters are in Durham, North Carolina. For further information about our consolidated revenue and earnings, please see our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Reportable Segments Our  three  reportable segments are: • Wolfspeed • LED Products • Lighting Products Reportable segments are components of an entity that have separate financial data that the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews when allocating resources and assessing performance. Our CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM does not review inter-segment transactions when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment, and inter-segment transactions are not included in our segment revenue disclosure. As such, total segment revenue is equal to our consolidated revenue. Our CODM reviews gross profit as the lowest and only level of segment profit. As such, all items below gross profit in the Consolidated Statements of Loss must be included to reconcile the consolidated gross profit to our consolidated loss before income taxes. 29 For financial results by reportable segment, please refer to Note  15 , “Reportable Segments,” in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Industry Dynamics and Trends There are a number of industry factors that affect our business which include, among others: • Overall Demand for Products and Applications using SiC power devices, GaN and Si RF devices, and LEDs . Our potential for growth depends significantly on the adoption of SiC and GaN materials and device products in the power and RF markets, the continued use of Si devices in the RF telecommunications market, the continued adoption of LEDs and LED lighting, and our ability to win new designs for these applications. Demand also fluctuates based on various market cycles, continuously evolving industry supply chains, and evolving competitive dynamics in each of the respective markets. These uncertainties make demand difficult to forecast for us and our customers. • Intense and Constantly Evolving Competitive Environment.  Competition in the industries we serve is intense. Many companies have made significant investments in product development and production equipment. Product pricing pressures exist as market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share, increase the utilization of their production capacity and open new applications in the power, RF, LED and lighting markets we serve. To remain competitive, market participants must continuously increase product performance, reduce costs and develop improved ways to serve their customers. To address these competitive pressures, we have invested in research and development activities to support new product development, lower product costs and deliver higher levels of performance to differentiate our products in the market. In addition, we invest in systems, people and new processes to improve our ability to deliver a better overall experience for our customers. • Technological Innovation and Advancement.  Innovations and advancements in materials, power, RF, LEDs and lighting technologies continue to expand the potential commercial application for our products. However, new technologies or standards could emerge or improvements could be made in existing technologies that could reduce or limit the demand for our products in certain markets. • Intellectual Property Issues.  Market participants rely on patented and non-patented proprietary information relating to product development, manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business. Protection of intellectual property is critical. Therefore, steps such as additional patent applications, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, as well as other security measures are generally taken. To enforce or protect intellectual property rights, litigation or threatened litigation is common. • Governmental Trade and Regulatory Conditions . Our potential for growth, as with most multi-national companies, depends on a balanced and stable trade, political, economic and regulatory environment among the countries where we do business. Changes in trade policy such as the imposition of tariffs or export bans to specific customers or countries could reduce or limit demand for our products in certain markets. • Lighting Sales Channel Development.  Commercial lighting is usually sold through lighting agents and distributors in the North American lighting market. The lighting agents typically have exclusive sales rights for a defined territory and are typically aligned with one large lighting company for a large percentage of their product sales. The size, quality and capability of the lighting agent has a significant effect on winning new projects and sales in any given geographic market. While these agents sell other lighting products, the large traditional lighting companies have taken steps to prevent their channel partners from selling competing product lines. We are constantly working to improve the capabilities of our existing channel partners and increase our share of their sales as well as develop new partners to improve our sales effectiveness in each geographic market. Fiscal  2018  Overview The following is a summary of our financial results for the year ended  June 24, 2018 : • Our year-over-year revenue  increased  by $ 21 million  to  $1.5 billion . • Gross margin  decreased  to  27.3%  from  29.5% . Gross profit  decreased  by  $27 million  to  $408 million . • Operating loss  was  $329 million  in fiscal  2018 , which includes impairment charges of  $247 million  attributable to our Lighting Products segment, compared to operating loss of  $19 million  in fiscal  2017 .  Net loss  per diluted share was  $2.81  in fiscal  2018  compared to net loss per diluted share of  $1.00  in fiscal  2017 . 30 • Combined cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments  decreased  to  $387 million  at  June 24, 2018  from  $611 million  at  June 25, 2017 . Cash provided by operating activities was  $167 million  in fiscal  2018 , compared to  $216 million  in fiscal  2017 . • Purchases of property and equipment were  $186 million  in fiscal  2018  compared to  $87 million  in fiscal  2017 . Business Outlook We are uniquely positioned as an innovator in all three business segments. The strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow provides us the ability to invest in our businesses, as we did with the recent asset acquisition of the Infineon RF Power business to aid in the growth of our Wolfspeed segment as discussed in Note  4 , "Acquisition" to our audited financial statements in Part II, Item in the Consolidated Statements of Loss Loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets $227   $227   Loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets Severance expense 5,470   4,682   Sales, general and administrative expenses Lease termination and facility consolidation costs 2,182   156   Sales, general and administrative expenses Increase in inventory reserves 897   897   Sales, general and administrative expenses Total restructuring charges $8,776   $5,962     LED Business Restructuring In June 2015, our Board of Directors approved a plan to restructure the LED Products business. The restructuring reduced excess capacity and overhead in order to improve the cost structure moving forward. The primary components of the restructuring include the planned sale or abandonment of certain manufacturing equipment, facility consolidation and the elimination of certain positions. The restructuring activity ended in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we realized $18.8 million in LED restructuring charges, which were partially offset by a $1.1 million gain on the sale of long-lived assets related to the restructuring which were sold for a value in excess of their estimated net realizable value during fiscal 2016.  The following table summarizes the actual charges incurred (in thousands):  Capacity and overhead cost reductions Amounts incurred during fiscal year 2015   Amounts incurred during fiscal year 2016   Cumulative amounts incurred through fiscal year 2016   Affected Line Item 8 of this Annual Report. COGS Acquisition Related Cost Adjustment The cost of goods sold (COGS) acquisition related cost adjustment was  $5.4 million  and  $0 million  for fiscal  2018 , and  2017 , respectively. The COGS acquisition related cost adjustment includes inventory fair value amortization of the fair value increase to inventory recognized at the date of acquisition, and other RF Power acquisition costs, impacting cost of revenue for fiscal  2018 . These costs were not allocated to the reportable segments’ gross profit for fiscal  2018  because they represent an adjustment which does not provide comparability to the corresponding prior period and therefore were not reviewed by our CODM when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources. Research and Development Research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products, enhancements of existing products and general technology research. These costs consisted primarily of employee salaries and related compensation costs, occupancy costs, consulting costs and the cost of development equipment and supplies. 35 The following sets forth our research and development expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):   Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 24, 2018   June 25, 2017   June 26, 2016   2017 to 2018   2016 to 2017 Research and development $164,321   $158,549   $168,848   $5,772   4 %   ($10,299 )   (6 )% Percent of revenue 11 %   11 %   10 %                 Research and development expenses  increased  in fiscal  2018  to  $164.3 million  compared to  $158.5 million  in fiscal  2017 , which decreased from  $168.8 million  in fiscal  2016 . The  increase  in fiscal  2018  compared to fiscal  2017  was primarily due to an increase in Wolfspeed research and development to accelerate 150mm substrate development, next generation power and RF device research and development and the inclusion of the acquired RF Power business research and development spend for the last four months of fiscal 2018. The decrease in fiscal  2017  compared to fiscal  2016  was primarily due to cost management and the nature of the ongoing research and development projects. Our research and development expenses vary significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, including the timing of new product introductions and the number and nature of our ongoing research and development activities.  Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and our executive and administrative personnel (for example, finance, human resources, information technology and legal) and consisted of salaries and related compensation costs; consulting and other professional services (such as litigation and other outside legal counsel fees, audit and other compliance costs); marketing and advertising expenses; facilities and insurance costs; and travel and other costs. The following table sets forth our sales, general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):     Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 24, 2018   June 25, 2017   June 26, 2016   2017 to 2018   2016 to 2017 Sales, general and administrative $283,489   $277,175   $283,052   $6,314   2 %   ($5,877 )   (2 )% Percent of revenue 19 %   19 %   18 %                 Sales, general and administrative expenses in fiscal  2018   increased   2%  to  $283.5 million  from  $277.2 million  in fiscal  2017 , which was a  2%  decrease from  $283.1 million  in fiscal  2016 . The  increase  in fiscal  2018  compared to fiscal  2017  was primarily due to the additional costs assumed in running the business and operations acquired in the RF Power acquisition, which closed in March 2018, the additional non-recurring costs associated with completing and integrating the RF Power acquisition, and severance costs pursuant to our Lighting Products restructuring plan, partially offset by the decrease in Wolfspeed transaction expenses associated with the terminated sale to Infineon in fiscal 2017.  The decrease in fiscal  2017  compared to fiscal  2016  was primarily due to lower spending on corporate sales and marketing expenses related to lower sales and a decrease in litigation spending partially offset by higher Wolfspeed transaction expenses referred to above. Amortization or Impairment of Acquisition-Related Intangibles As a result of our acquisitions, we have recognized various amortizable intangible assets, including customer relationships, developed technology, non-compete agreements and trade names.  36 Amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions was as follows (in thousands, except percentages):   Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 24,  2018   June 25,  2017   June 26,  2016   2017 to 2018   2016 to 2017 Customer relationships $8,097   $6,235   $6,374   $1,862   30 %   ($139 )   (2 )% Developed technology 21,686   20,860   20,321   826   4 %   539   3  % Non-compete agreements 989   404   2,037   585   145 %   (1,633 )   (80 )% Total $30,772   $27,499   $28,732   $3,273   12 %   ($1,233 )   (4 )% Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles  increased  in fiscal  2018  compared to fiscal  2017  due to the acquisition of the RF Power business that was purchased during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased in fiscal  2017  compared to fiscal  2016  primarily due to less amortization expense for customer relationships and non-compete agreements in fiscal 2017. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the amortization of developed technology related to the acquisition of Arkansas Power Electronics International, Inc. (APEI) that was placed in service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Impairment of Goodwill Based on the updated long-range business strategy that was announced February 26, 2018, we determined there was a triggering event and performed an impairment test in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the period ended March 25, 2018. As a result of this evaluation, we determined the remaining carrying value for the Lighting Products segment exceeded the fair value and therefore, we recorded a  $247.5 million  non-cash goodwill impairment charge attributable to our Lighting Products segment in our fiscal third quarter ended March 25, 2018. The impairment charge resulted from the inability to meet forecasted results and our new business strategy. Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We operate a capital-intensive business. As such, we dispose of a certain level of our equipment in the normal course of business as our production processes change due to production improvement initiatives or product mix changes. Due to the risk of technological obsolescence or changes in our production process, we regularly review our equipment and capitalized patent costs for possible impairment. The following table sets forth our loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets (in thousands, except percentages):   Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 24, 2018   June 25, 2017   June 26, 2016   2017 to 2018   2016 to 2017 Loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets $10,692   $2,521   $16,913   $8,171   324 %   ($14,392 )   (85 )% We recognized a net loss of  $10.7 million ,  $2.5 million , and  $16.9 million  on the disposal of long-lived assets in fiscal years  2018 ,  2017 , and  2016 , respectively. The  increase  in net loss in fiscal  2018  compared to fiscal  2017  was primarily due to demolition and moving costs associated with our current Wolfspeed manufacturing capacity expansion, closure of certain manufacturing facilities, and a fair value market write-down for a sold aircraft. The net losses in fiscal  2017  and fiscal  2016  were primarily due to the planned sale or abandonment of certain long-lived assets to reduce excess manufacturing capacity pursuant to our LED Products restructuring plan discussed above.  Wolfspeed Transaction Termination Fee As discussed more fully in Note  1 , “Business”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, as a result of the termination of the agreement to sell the Wolfspeed business to Infineon, Infineon paid us a termination fee of $12.5 million in cash on March 10, 2017.  37 Non-Operating Income (Expense), net The following table sets forth our non-operating income (expense), net (in thousands, except percentages):   Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 24, 2018   June 25, 2017   June 26, 2016   2017 to 2018   2016 to 2017 (Loss) gain on sale of investments, net ($86 )   $93   $238   ($179 )   (192 )%   ($145 )   (61 )% Gain (loss) on equity investment 7,145   7,543   (15,357 )   (398 )   (5 )%   22,900   149  % Dividends from equity investment —   16   1,655   (16 )   (100 )%   (1,639 )   (99 )% Interest income, net 1,827   3,696   4,472   (1,869 )   (51 )%   (776 )   (17 )% Foreign currency gain (loss), net 2,250   2,460   (4,500 )   (210 )   (9 )%   6,960   155  % Other, net 506   200   457   306   153  %   (257 )   (56 )% Non-operating income (expense), net $11,642   $14,008   ($13,035 )   ($2,366 )   (17 )%   $27,043   207  % During fiscal  2018 ,  2017  and  2016 , we were in a net interest income position. Our short-term investments consisted primarily of municipal bonds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency securities, and non-U.S. certificates of deposit. The primary objective of our investment policy is preservation of principal. Other long-term investments consisted of our approximately 16% common stock ownership interest in Lextar, which was completed in December 2014. This investment was accounted for under the equity method from the date of investment until June 2016 when we chose for our representative not to stand for re-election as a member of the Lextar board of directors. We utilize the fair value option in accounting for our investment in Lextar. (Loss) gain on sale of investments, net .  Loss on sale of investments, net was  $86 thousand  in fiscal 2018, compared to a gain on sale of investments of  $93 thousand  and  $238 thousand  in fiscal  2017  and fiscal  2016 , respectively. We had a loss on sale of investments, net in fiscal  2018  primarily due to losses realized on the sale of investments liquidated in order to partially fund the purchase of the RF Power business.  Gain on sale of investments, net decreased in fiscal  2017  from fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower sales of investments. Gain (loss) on equity investment .  Gain on equity investment was  $7.1 million  in fiscal 2018, gain on equity investment was  $7.5 million  in fiscal  2017  and loss on equity investment was  $15.4 million  in fiscal  2016 . We had a gain on equity investment in fiscal  2018  and fiscal 2017 due to the increase in the fair value of our Lextar investment. We had a loss on equity investment in fiscal 2016 due to the decrease in the fair value of our Lextar investment. Lextar’s stock is publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and its share price increased from 15.70 New Taiwanese Dollars (TWD) at June 26, 2016 to 18.40 TWD at June 25, 2017 and to 21.00 TWD at June 24, 2018. Lextar's share price decreased from 21.55 TWD at June 28, 2015 to 15.70 TWD at June 26, 2016. This volatile stock price trend may continue in the future given the risks inherent in Lextar’s business and trends affecting the Taiwan and global equity markets. Any future stock price changes will be recorded as further gains or losses on equity investment based on the increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value of the investment during the applicable fiscal period. Further losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Dividends from equity investment .  Dividends from equity investment  were  $0.0 million ,  $0.0 million  and  $1.7 million  in fiscal  2018 , fiscal  2017  and fiscal  2016 , respectively, due to our Lextar investment. Interest income, net .   Interest income, net  was  $1.8 million ,  $3.7 million  and  $4.5 million  in fiscal  2018 , fiscal  2017  and fiscal  2016 , respectively. The  decrease  in interest income, net in fiscal  2018  compared to fiscal  2017  was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields. The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal  2017  compared to fiscal  2016  was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields. Foreign currency gain (loss), net .  Foreign currency gain (loss), net  consisted primarily of remeasurement adjustments resulting from our Lextar investment and consolidating our international subsidiaries. The foreign currency gain, net in fiscal  2018  was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate between both the Chinese Yuan (CNY) and the Euro (EUR) and the United States Dollar (USD) which was partially offset by an unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the USD related to our Lextar investment. The foreign currency gain, net in fiscal  2017  was primarily due to favorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the CNY and the EUR and the USD which was partially offset by an unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the USD related to our Lextar investment. The foreign currency loss, net for fiscal  2016  was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the USD related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the CNY and the USD. 38 Other, net .  Other, net was  $506 thousand ,  $200 thousand  and  $457 thousand  in fiscal  2018 , fiscal  2017  and fiscal  2016 , respectively.  Income Tax (Benefit) Expense The following table sets forth our income tax (benefit) expense in dollars and our effective tax rate (in thousands, except percentages):   Fiscal Years Ended   Year-Over-Year Change   June 24,  2018   June 25,  2017   June 26,  2016   2017 to 2018   2016 to 2017 Income tax (benefit) expense ($37,522 )   $93,454   ($1,970 )   (130,976 )   (140 )%   95,424   4,844 % Effective tax rate 12 %   (2,004 )%   8 %                 We recognized income tax benefit of  $37.5 million  in fiscal  2018  as compared to income tax expense of  $93.5 million  in fiscal  2017 . The  increase  in the effective tax rate from  (2,004)%  in fiscal  2017  to  12%  in fiscal  2018  was primarily attributable to the tax benefit of remeasuring our U.S. deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, and the establishment of a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets during the fiscal year ended  June 25, 2017 . The decrease in the effective tax rate from  8%  in fiscal  2016  to  (2,004)%  in fiscal  2017  was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets and other deferred charges in a period of pre-tax loss. In general, the variation between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of  28.3%  (calculated as described in the following paragraph) is primarily due to: (i) changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Luxembourg, (ii) income derived from international locations with lower tax rates than the U.S., and (iii) tax credits generated. The Tax Legislation contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. U.S. tax law requires that taxpayers with a fiscal year that begins before the effective date of a rate change and ends after the effective date calculate a blended tax rate for the year based on the pro rata number of days in the year before and after the effective date. As a result, for the fiscal year ending  June 24, 2018 , our statutory income tax rate is 28.3%. For the fiscal year ending  June 30, 2019 , our U.S. statutory income tax rate will be 21%. The Tax Legislation is discussed more fully in Note 13, “Income Taxes” to our audited financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for research and development, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, marketable securities, cash generated from operations and availability under our line of credit. Our ability to generate cash from operations has been one of our fundamental strengths and has provided us with substantial flexibility in meeting our operating, financing and investing needs. We have a $500 million line of credit as discussed in Note 9, “Long-term Debt,” in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. We have entered into operating leases primarily for certain of our U.S. and international facilities in the normal course of business. Future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of  June 24, 2018  are detailed above in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the section entitled “Contractual Obligations.” Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the application of U.S. GAAP, we are required to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the accounting estimates from period to period are reasonably likely to occur. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition, product warranty obligations, valuation of inventories, tax related contingencies, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, other contingencies and litigation, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, including expected trends that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note  2 , “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
