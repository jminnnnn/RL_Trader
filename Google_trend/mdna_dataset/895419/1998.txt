These risks and uncertainties include the Company's ability to complete development of and successfully introduce new LED and microwave products, to lower LED and wafer costs, to gain a larger customer base, and to increase product yields and wafer size, possible price competition, potential failure to obtain expected volume increases from existing customers, potential infringement claims by third parties, potential inability of the Company to enforce its intellectual property rights against others, availability and continuation of U.S. government funded research contracts, possible delays in the introduction of other new products, and delays in customer acceptance of products or services and other factors, which are described herein. See Item 1, Business, Risk Factors.           On September 24, 1997, the Board of Directors of Cree Research, Inc. changed the Company's fiscal year from the twelve months ending June 30, to a 52 or 53 week year ending on the last Sunday in the month of June. The Company's 1998 fiscal year extended for the period from July 1, 1997 to June 28, 1998.  Results of Operations           For the fiscal year ended June 28, 1998, Cree posted record revenue and net income of $42,531,000 and $6,275,000, or $0.47 per diluted share, respectively. These results reflect an increase in revenue and net income of $13,558,000 and $2,733,000, respectively, over the prior year. Product revenue, which includes LED, wafer and other material sales, module display products and moving message sign sales, reflects a 76% increase over fiscal 1997 results. Comparatively, product revenue also increased 105% during fiscal 1997 over 1996 amounts.  Product Revenue           During fiscal 1998, a significant portion of the rise in product revenue was directly attributable to the 132% increase in blue light-emitting diode ("LED") volume pursuant to an amendment to a purchase agreement signed in September 1996 with Siemens A.G. ("Siemens"). That agreement and two subsequent amendments, provided for $6.8 million in additional sales to Siemens in fiscal 1998 over 1997. As amended, the agreement presently obligates Siemens to purchase certain quantities of LED products through December 1998. Additionally, the amendment provides for higher prices per unit on items shipped early in the contract, with unit prices being reduced as volume increases in the latter part of the contract. Further reductions in per unit costs are expected throughout fiscal 1999 as a result of the full implementation to the conductive buffer product, higher throughput and other plant asset efficiencies. There can be no assurance that these                                          18   efficiencies will be achieved. LED sales also increased by 70% in fiscal 1997 over 1996 amounts due to volume stemming from the original agreement and first amendment with Siemens.           The Company continues to focus on obtaining additional LED customers who are interested in ordering commercial quantities of the product. To meet this goal the Company anticipates the release of new higher brightness blue and green LED products, which are expected to be competitive in outdoor applications, during the first half of fiscal 1999. Anticipated volume associated with these new products, combined with lower LED pricing, are expected to increase customer orders. If the Company is unable to expand its customer base or release these new products, its revenue and earnings growth potential could be adversely impacted. The Company believes that in order to significantly grow market demand for LED products and to defray competition, it must continue to substantially lower prices. During fiscal 1998, the Company's average sales price per LED unit dropped 32% over 1997 levels. This decline in price was more than offset by the 132% increase in product volume. The Company's goal is to continue to lower sales prices to meet customer price points throughout fiscal 1999. While the Company reported a lower average sales price for LEDs during fiscal 1998, total product profitability increased due to higher volumes and other efficiencies. Overall, average chip costs also declined in fiscal 1998 due to a combination of a smaller chip size, the conversion to a two inch diameter wafer, higher volume which spreads fixed costs over more units and, in the latter half of the fourth quarter, benefits from the conductive buffer technology.           During 1999, the Company anticipates further reductions in chip costs due to the full year benefits of the conductive buffer process, higher volume throughput and greater yield. If the Company is unable to realize these benefits, profits are anticipated to deteriorate during fiscal 1999 due to declining per unit sales prices in the Company's contract with Siemens. Greater volume, while maintaining margins per unit, has been and will continue to be Cree's strategy in the LED marketplace. Many current and potential customers for the Company's products are based in Asia. Poor economic conditions and currency devaluation in some countries may adversely affect the Company's ability to increase sales volume both as a result of lower demand by customers and competition reducing the price of products.           Wafer and other materials revenue has increased 56% in fiscal 1998 over 1997 due primarily to a 29% increase in wafer volume associated with a greater interest in the worldwide research community for SiC-based products. The Company continues to make improvements to the quality of its SiC material, thus increasing the demand for research in microwave and power applications. These wafer quality improvements have also led to corporate research funding, including work performed toward the development of both microwave and power devices during the year. Profits contributed by wafer sales are expected to rise as the Company continues to improve quality while lowering costs due to higher throughput and greater yield efficiency. During fiscal 1997, wafer sales grew 60% over 1996 amounts, due to the greater acceptance of the material in the marketplace and a slight increase in the average sales price due to a greater mix of premium wafer products available with low defect levels.           In July 1997, the Company announced development and supply agreements with C3, to develop and supply bulk single crystal silicon carbide for gemstone applications. The development program included the development of improved processes for manufacturing colorless single crystalline SiC for use in gemstones with diamond-like characteristics. This research is particularly important as it also funds the development of larger diameter crystals. In addition to the development agreement, the Company also entered into an exclusive supply agreement where the output of dedicated production was supplied and priced at cost plus a stipulated margin. For fiscal 1999, pricing under the supply agreement has been superseded by a separate agreement that allows output from dedicated production to be priced based on the quality of the material. In addition, C3 has agreed to pay the Company up to $3.4 million for the purchase of additional equipment to increase available capacity at Cree. Over one half of this equipment was billed to C3 during fiscal 1998, however this transaction was not recorded as revenue. Total revenue for materials used in gemstone applications increased 89% in fiscal 1998 as compared to 1997 as a result of these two agreements. Material purchased                                           19   by C3 under the supply agreement may be used solely for the fabrication and sale of gemstones. During fiscal 1997 and 1996, the Company sold material products to C3 at margins consistent with those achieved in connection with sales of similar products to the Company's other customers.           Financial results for the display product line includes sales of both modules and sign products. Revenue for the modules business increased by 29% in fiscal 1998 over the prior year due to increased interest among customers for the video display indoor stadium sign. Moving message sign sales by RCD, the Company's subsidiary, suffered a 72% decline in revenue compared to 1997 due to a 71% decrease in volume and slightly reduced average sales prices. This reduction was prompted by the Company's shift to the module product line. During fiscal 1998, the Company primarily sold an existing inventory of moving message signs and did not expand or refresh the product line. The Company is currently reviewing the business plan of these product lines to maximize sales for fiscal 1999. The Company expects the release of low priced, high brightness LED products that will compete in outdoor applications in fiscal 1999. These new LEDs are anticipated to change market opportunities for display products. Revenue for the display business grew 76% in fiscal 1997 from 1996 due to the introduction of the modules line of business during that year.  Contract Revenue           Research contract revenue increased 17% to $7,640,000 during fiscal 1998 as a result of the mix of funding from available contracts. Funding for fiscal 1997 included a higher amount of proceeds recognized under two cost-share arrangements. For these agreements, funds are recorded as a reduction in research and development expense rather than as contract revenue. As funds associated with these two programs were exhausted during the second quarter of fiscal 1998, Company resources were shifted to programs under a cost-plus or catalog price arrangement, in which funding is recorded as contract revenue. Therefore, contract revenue was higher in fiscal 1998 than 1997. Contract revenue grew 66% to $6,535,000 in fiscal 1997 as higher revenues were generated as a result of more funding being made available from the U.S. government for certain research contracts, primarily in the areas of microwave, power, blue laser and basic material development.  License Fee Income           Included in revenue for fiscal 1997 is a one-time license fee of $2,615,000. This license fee was earned pursuant to a License and Technology Transfer Agreement entered into in September 1996 with Shin-Etsu Handotai Co. Ltd. ("Shin-Etsu"). Pursuant to this agreement, the Company granted Shin-Etsu a license to use certain epitaxial and device fabrication process technology for the manufacture of the Company's LED product. The Company also recorded an accrued expense of $186,000 payable in July 1998 to a third party that brokered the agreement. Results for fiscal 1996 include a one-time net license fee revenue of $1,423,000. This license fee was earned pursuant to a Development License and Supply Agreement entered in October 1995 with Siemens, in which the Company granted Siemens a license to use certain technology to manufacture blue and green LED products. No license fee arrangements were recorded by the Company during fiscal 1998.  Cost of Revenue           The Company's gross margin increased 47% to $14,552,000, or 34% of revenue for fiscal 1998. The Company's gross margin as a percentage of sales was 34% and 24% in 1997 and 1996, respectively. License fee revenue, which has no corresponding cost, is included in both 1997 and 1996 results. Without license fees, gross margins would have been $7,263,000 or 28% of revenue for fiscal 1997 and $2,145,000 or 16% of revenue for the comparative period in 1996. The overall increase in margin in 1998 stems from higher revenue and lower LED and materials costs per unit. The lower unit costs were recognized due to higher                                           20   throughput, which more effectively utilized plant capacity, and yield efficiencies on LED and wafer products. This greater throughput enabled the Company to spread fixed cost investments over a larger volume of product. Greater yield in LED applications resulted from a combination of a new smaller die size, the new two inch diameter wafer and the introduction of the conductive buffer technology. Yield was also higher for LED and materials due to plant processing efficiency and improvements and a higher quality of wafer materials. Higher margins in the future are largely contingent on the Company's ability to increase the volume of LEDs produced, by gaining a larger customer base, successfully introducing new products and continued savings from the conductive buffer technology. These factors are significant due to the anticipated decline in the average LED per unit sales price to be received in 1999. If the Company is unable to improve efficiency under the new chip standards or gain orders for additional volume, gross margin could be negatively impacted. Gross margin improved in 1997 from 1996 levels, due to higher revenue and throughput associated with the Siemens agreement, and yield efficiencies, which lowered the manufacturing cost per unit.           The Company benefits from research and development efforts sponsored by U.S. government contracts. Contracts are awarded to the Company to fund both short-term and long-term research projects. For contracts under which the Company anticipates that funding will exceed direct costs, all funding is reported as contract revenue and direct costs are reported as cost of contract revenue. For contracts under which the Company anticipates that direct costs will exceed funding, costs are reflected as research and development expenses with the related funding amounts offsetting these costs. Cost of contract revenue has increased in fiscal 1998 over 1997 due primarily to the exhaustion of funds available under two cost-share contracts during the first half of the year. Costs for research under these two arrangements were included as research and development expenses rather than a cost of contract revenue. When funding under these two contracts was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 1998, all resources were shifted to cost-plus and catalog priced contracts, where expenses are recorded as a cost of contract revenue. Contract cost of revenue was significantly higher in fiscal 1997 than 1996 as a result of more funding being made available from the U.S. government for certain research contracts, primarily in the areas of microwave, power, blue laser and basic material development.           Research and development costs have decreased by 3% to $1,774,000 in 1998 due to a reduction in work performed under two cost-share contracts to further the blue laser research. Net costs to the Company for these projects were $276,000 and $671,000 for fiscal 1998 and 1997, respectively. These cost-share contracts concluded during the first half of 1998. Additionally, research and development costs for 1997, included a one-time write off of $93,000 for the closure of the Company's Eastern European Division. The Eastern European Division, located in St. Petersburg, Russia, was a research group performing some of the Company's basic material and device development work. Work performed under cost-share arrangements in fiscal 1997 also explains  why research and development costs were higher in that year than in 1996.           Sales and general and administrative expenses decreased 4% to $4,131,100 for fiscal 1998, compared to 1997 levels as increased costs to support the growth of the business were offset by two one-time insurance payments to the Company. As a result of the dismissal in November 1997 of a securities class action lawsuit filed in October 1996, the Company was reimbursed $216,000 by its insurance carrier for costs incurred in defense of the suit. In addition, as a result of a negotiated cost cap, the Company received a $220,000 reimbursement of medical expenses that were incurred under a partially self insured health plan. As a percentage of revenue, these costs have decreased to 10% in 1998 from 15% and 19% in 1997 and 1996, respectively. Total sales and general and administrative expenses increased 47% in fiscal 1997 over 1996 amounts due to higher costs associated with additional sales personnel to focus the business on gaining new LED customers, the SEH license agreement commission fee (a net present value of $172,000) and greater legal fees in connection with the defense of a securities class action lawsuit that has since been dismissed. The Company anticipates that sales and general and administrative expenses will continue to rise in future                                          21   periods to support the anticipated growth of the business, however, the cost as a percentage of total revenue is expected to decline as economies of scale continue to be realized.           Other (income) expense includes a net loss recorded on the disposal of certain fixed assets and the write-off of $66,000 for the remaining value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of the Real Color Displays subsidiary. In addition, the Company has entered into an agreement with C3 to sell equipment manufactured by the Company at cost plus a reasonable overhead allocation. The overhead allocation was recorded as "other operating income"; however, the amount was more than offset by leasehold write-offs associated with the move to the new facility and other asset disposals.           Net interest income increased by $123,000 in 1998 over 1997 results and decreased by $260,000 when comparing 1997 to 1996, due to higher investable cash balances available in fiscal 1998 and 1996. Cash balances were high in fiscal 1998 as the Company generated over $12 million from operations compared to $6 million in fiscal 1997. Also, the Company concluded a private equity placement in September 1995 that also increased available cash in 1996.           The Company's income tax provision has increased to 29% for 1998 from a 5% effective rate experienced during 1997. The lower rate for 1997 resulted from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. The Company anticipates a slightly higher tax rate for fiscal 1999 as most carryforwards previously available have now been utilized. The Company had no tax provision in 1996 as the Company generated a net operating loss for tax purposes.  Liquidity and Capital Resources           Net cash provided by operations reached a record $12,092,000 in 1998 compared with $6,097,000 in 1997, and cash used in operations of $1,636,000 in 1995. These increases reported in 1998 and 1997 resulted from profitable operations of the Company. If the Company achieves its goals of increasing customer demand while lowering production costs, the Company expects that cash provided by operations will increase in 1999 and will be sufficient to fund all anticipated capital additions. The Company will; however, consider opportunities to raise capital and to fund development costs through strategic alliances and other manners.           The number of trade average days sales outstanding was reduced to 50 for 1998 from 57 and 96 days experienced in 1997 and 1996, respectively, due to collections efforts during the year.           The Company invested $15,287,000 in capital equipment during 1998 compared to $8,115,000 and $14,740,000 spent during 1997 and 1996, respectively. The majority of the 1998 spending, or $11,400,000, was due to the acquisition and upfit of a new production facility near Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The total capital outlay for this facility and associated upfit is estimated to be approximately $15,000,000 and is expected to be completed over the next six months. The Company currently has a loan commitment of up to $10,000,000 from a commercial bank to finance a portion of these expenditures. As of June 28, 1998, approximately $8,667,000 had been drawn against this loan. At this time, the Company anticipates capital additions in 1999 to be 25% lower than amounts spent in 1998 and intends to fund these additions with cash provided by operations and cash on hand. In addition, the Company also expects to draw the remaining $1,333,000 on the loan commitment and may consider other financing alternatives. During 1997, investments were made for equipment additions in the crystal growth and epitaxial departments. During 1996, a significant investment was made for equipment related to the production of LED and wafer products. Financing activities provided the Company $10,341,000 during 1998 mostly due to the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt discussed above. In addition, financing activities yielded $20,924,000 during fiscal 1996. The majority of the funding was provided by the September 1995 private placement which netted approximately $17.5 million.                                         22   Year 2000           The Company's products are of a nature that they are not subject to failure because of Year 2000 issues. The Company however, has assigned full-time information technology professionals to the task of identifying and resolving Year 2000 problems that may affect the Company's business, and has adopted a phased Year 2000 compliance plan. During the first phase, commenced in April 1998 and targeted for completion in December 1998, the Company will inventory and collect documentation on all of its computers, computer related equipment, and equipment with embedded processors. In addition, the Company will contact critical vendors and suppliers to obtain assurances of their ability to ensure smooth delivery of products and services after December 1999. In the second and third phases, the Company will prioritize and implement necessary repairs or replacements to equipment in order to achieve Year 2000 compliance, which it expects to complete in the first quarter of 1999. The final phase will consist of a testing program, scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 1999. The Company has not prepared estimates of costs for correction of Year 2000 problems. Based on information available at this time, including the Year 2000 compliance status of equipment that has been examined as well as the anticipated replacement schedule for equipment, the Company does not believe that the cost of remedial actions will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. There can be no assurance, however, that there will not be a delay in, or increased costs associated with, the implementation of corrections as the Year 2000 compliance plan is performed. Failure to implement such changes could have an adverse effect on future results of operations. In addition, unexpected costs of correcting equipment that has not yet been fully evaluated could have an adverse effect on future results of operations.                                          23   Item 8.
