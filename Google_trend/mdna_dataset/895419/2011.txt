Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations     Executive Summary    The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including a brief discussion of our business and products, keyfactors that impacted our performance, and a summary of our operating results. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Historical results andpercentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods.    Overview    We are a leading innovator of lighting-class LEDs, LED lightingand semiconductor products for wireless and power applications. Our products are driving improvements in applications such as general illumination, video displays, automotive, electronic signs and signals, variable-speed motors and wireless systems.      23     We develop and manufacture semiconductor materials and devices primarily based on SiC, GaNand related compounds. The physical and electronic properties of SiC and GaN offer technical advantages over traditional silicon, gallium arsenide (GaAs), sapphire and other materials used for certain electronic applications.   We derive the largest portion of our revenue from sales of our LED products. These products consist of LED chips, LED components, LEDlighting products and SiC wafers. Also included in LED product revenues are revenues derived from government agencies to support the development of LED lighting, and license fees from intellectual property rights. As we develop and improve our LEDtechnology and the market continues to focus on energy efficiency, we believe the potential market for LED lighting will continue to expand. Our success in selling LED products depends upon our ability to drive adoption and offer innovative productsand solutions that enable our customers to succeed in the market. By driving adoption we believe we can influence the market and open more opportunities for LEDs.    In addition, we generate revenue from sales of power and RF products. Also included are revenues derived from government agencies to support the development of SiC- and GaN-based power and RF technology.   The majority of our products are manufactured at our production facilities located in North Carolina and China. We also usecontract manufacturers for certain aspects of product fabrication and packaging. We operate research and development facilities in North Carolina, California, and China.    Operating Segments    We currently operate our business as one reportablesegment.    Industry Dynamics and Trends    There are a number of industry factors that affect our business which include, among others:                   Overall Demand for Products and Applications using LEDs . Our potential for growth depends significantly on the adoption of LEDs within thegeneral lighting market and our ability to affect this rate of adoption. Although LED lighting has grown in recent years, adoption of LEDs for general lighting is relatively new, still limited, and faces significant challenges before widespreadadoption. Demand also fluctuates based on various market cycles, a continuously evolving LED industry supply chain, and demand dynamics in the market. These uncertainties make demand difficult to forecast for us and our customers.                  Intense and Constantly Evolving Competitive Environment.  Competition in the industry is intense and new companies have entered and are enteringthe LED market, with many companies making significant investments in LED production equipment. Product pricing pressures exist as market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share and to increase the utilizationof their production capacity. To remain competitive, market participants must continuously increase product performance and reduce costs to offset lower average sales prices. To address this pricing pressure, we have invested in the development of150mm wafer production, which is intended to reduce our costs of producing LED chips. Certain of our competitors also have announced the intention to produce, or have begun producing, LED chips using 150mm wafers .                   Technological Innovation and Advancement.  Innovations and advancements in LED technology continue to expand the potential commercial applicationof LEDs particularly in the general illumination market. However, new technologies or standards could emerge, or improvements could be made in existing technologies, that reduce or limit the demand for LEDs in certain markets.                  Regulatory Actions Concerning Energy Efficiency.  Many countries have already instituted or have announced plans to institute governmentregulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency, even in some cases banning forms of incandescent lighting, which are advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as LEDs. While thistrend is generally positive, there have been some political efforts in the United States to change or limit the effectiveness of these new regulations.                   Intellectual Property Issues.  Market participants rely on patented and non-patented proprietary information relating to product development,manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business. Protection of intellectual property is critical. Therefore, steps such as additional patent applications, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, as well as othersecurity measures are       24            generally taken. To enforce or protect intellectual property rights, litigation or threatened litigation commonly occurs.   Fiscal 2011 Overview   The following is a summary of our financial results for the year ended June 26, 2011:                  Our year over year revenues increased 14% to $987.6 million.                  While gross margin percentage declined from 47% in fiscal 2010 to 44% in fiscal 2011, gross profit increased by $24.7 million.                  We achieved operating income of $168.7 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $197.8 million in fiscal 2010. Net income per diluted share was $1.33compared to $1.45 for fiscal 2010.                   Combined cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to $1,085.8 million at June 26, 2011 compared to $1,066.4 million atJune 27, 2010.                   Inventory increased to $176.5 million at June 26, 2011 compared to $112.2 million at June 27, 2010.                  We spent $237.1 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 compared to $168.6 million in fiscal 2010 as we continue to expand our manufacturingcapacity.    Business Outlook    We project that the markets for our products will remain highly competitive during fiscal 2012. We anticipate focusing on the following key areas, among others, in response to this competitiveenvironment:                   Build on our  market  leadership  and drive adoption of  LED lighting.  We are focused on developing innovative new LEDlighting systems to drive adoption, and new LED components that enable our customers to deliver a more competitive payback versus traditional lighting. We recognize that our leadership in lighting systems can sometimes raise questions with ourcomponent customers, but we believe this product line has helped the Company set new standards in the market and disrupt the status quo in the lighting industry. We plan to continue to invest in these product lines to increase performance, enablelower lighting system costs with shorter paybacks (like our CR series downlights and troffers), and find new ways to drive the market and obsolete old, energy-wasting lighting technology.                  Accelerate cost reductions and drive operational improvements to increase the profitability of our business.  We target lower LED costs from theconversion to 150mm wafers, higher factory utilization, as well as yield and productivity improvements. We plan to lower LED lighting system costs with new product designs that are under development and we target improved operating leverage fromhigher revenues across our LED lighting systems and component product lines.                   Expand the power and RF product line beyond niche applications . SiC power devices can deliver better performance and increased payback againstsilicon (Si) based power devices in applications where efficiency is an important criteria. We target continued investment in R&D for new diode and switch products focused on more mainstream and higher volume power switching applications. We aremanaging the product line through a slowdown in solar inverter demand, which we believe is a temporary market correction. We target the combination of new products, improved market demand and expanded sales coverage to drive growth in the productline.    Subsequent Event     On August 17, 2011, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with all of the shareholders of Ruud Lighting, Inc. (Ruud). Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with theexecution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of Ruud in exchange for consideration consisting of 6,074,833 shares of our common stock and $372.2 million cash, subject to certain post-closingadjustments. In connection with the stock purchase transaction with Ruud, we paid off Ruuds outstanding debt in the aggregate amount of approximately $85 million.

Revenuesfrom our LED products were $890.0, $789.9, and $524.3 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.    Revenue from LEDproducts increased approximately 13% to $890.0 million in fiscal 2011 from $789.9 million in fiscal 2010. This increase was driven by increased sales of LED components and LED lighting systems, partially offset by lower demand for LED chips and amore aggressive pricing environment. While individual LED product average selling prices (ASPs) declined year over year due to a more competitive pricing environment, the blended ASP for our LED products increased by 58% in fiscal 2011 compared tofiscal 2010. This increase was due to a shift in product mix to a higher proportion of revenues generated from sales of our LED components and LED lighting products versus our LED chips.   Revenue from our LED products increased $265.6 million or 51% to $789.9 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to $524.3 million in fiscal2009. We experienced year over year sales growth across all of our LED products with sales of LED components driving the majority of the overall increase. The blended ASP for our LED products increased approximately 13% in fiscal 2010 as compared tofiscal 2009. This increase was due to a shift in product mix to a higher proportion of revenues generated from sales of our LED components and LED lighting products.    Power and RF Products        26     Revenues from our power and RF products comprised approximately 10%, 9%, and 8% of our totalrevenues for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Revenues from our power and RF products were $97.6, $77.3, and $42.9 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.   Revenue from power and RF increased approximately 26% to $97.6 million in fiscal 2011 from $77.3 million in fiscal 2010. The increase inour power and RF products revenue was primarily due to increased orders for SiC Schottky diodes and GaN MMICs.    Revenue fromour power and RF products increased $34.4 million or 80% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in our power and RF business was primarily due to an increase in orders for SiC Schottky diodes and GaN MMICs.   Gross Profit   Cost of revenue includes materials, labor and overhead costs incurred internally or paid to contract manufacturers to produce ourproducts. Gross profit in dollars and gross margin were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):                                              Fiscal Years Ended        Year-Over-Year Change             June 26, 2011        June 27, 2010        June 28, 2009        2010 to 2011        2009 to 2010        Total gross profit      $  435,773         $  411,107         $  211,906         $  24,666             6  %      $  199,201             94  %      Total gross margin         44  %         47  %         37  %                               Total gross margin was 44%, 47%, and 37% for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively and gross profittotaled $435.8 million, $411.1 million and $211.9 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.    Gross profitincreased approximately 6% to $435.8 million in fiscal 2011 from $411.1 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to our higher revenue in fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011 our gross margin decreased to 44% from 47% in fiscal2010. Factors contributing to the decrease in gross margin were a more aggressive pricing environment and lower factory utilization.    Gross profit increased $199.2 million or 94% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and our gross margin increased to 47% from 37% over the same period. Factors contributing to the increase in grossmargin were increased demand and better factory utilization, higher product yields, favorable pricing environment and the successful introduction of a number of new products.    Research and Development    Research and development expenses includecosts associated with the development of new products, enhancements of existing products and general technology research. These costs consist primarily of employee salaries and related compensation costs, occupancy costs, consulting costs and thecost of development equipment and supplies.    The following sets forth our research and development expenses in dollars and asa percentage of revenues (in thousands, except percentages):                                              Fiscal Years Ended        Year-Over-Year Change             June 26, 2011        June 27, 2010        June 28, 2009        2010 to 2011        2009 to 2010        Research and development      $  115,035         $  81,407         $  71,363         $  33,628             41  %      $  10,044             14  %      Percent of revenue         12  %         9  %         13  %                               Research and development expenses in fiscal 2011 increased 41% to $115.0 million from $81.4 million infiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased spending to support the transition to 150mm wafer capabilities as well as continued research and development activities focused on new LED chips, LED components, LED lighting products, andpower products. Our research and development expenses vary significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, including: the timing of new product introductions, timing of expenditures and the number and nature of our      27     ongoing research and development activities. However, we anticipate that in general our research and development expenses will continue to increase over time to support future growth.   Research and development expenses increased 14% in fiscal 2010 to $81.4 million compared to $71.4 million in fiscal 2009. This increasewas primarily due to our continued research and development activities focusing on brighter LED chips, new and improved LED components, new LED lighting products and larger wafer development.    Sales, General and Administrative    Sales, general and administrativeexpenses are composed primarily of costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and our executive and administrative personnel (for example, legal, finance, information technology and human resources personnel) and consist of 1) salariesand related compensation costs, 2) consulting and other professional services (such as litigation and other outside legal counsel fees, audit and other compliance costs), 3) facilities and insurance costs, and 4) travel and other costs. Thefollowing table sets forth our sales, general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenues (in thousands, except percentages):                                              Fiscal Years Ended        Year-Over-Year Change             June 26, 2011        June 27, 2010        June 28, 2009        2010 to 2011        2009 to 2010        Sales, general and administrative      $  139,304         $  115,601         $  86,929         $  23,703             21  %      $  28,672             33  %      Percent of revenue         14  %         13  %         15  %                               Sales, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 increased 21% to $139.3 million from $115.6million in fiscal 2010. The increase in fiscal 2011 is primarily due to an increase in spending on sales and marketing as we expand our direct sales resources and channels and invest in building the Cree brand. Additionally, costs increased due tohigher patent litigation expenses.    Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 33% in fiscal 2010 to $115.6 millioncompared to $86.9 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in costs in fiscal 2010 is primarily due to increased spending on sales and marketing as we expanded our sales channels and invested in building the Cree brand as well as one-time costs relatedto the settlement of the Neumark litigation. Additionally, costs increased due to the general expansion of our business and increased employee compensation costs.    Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangibles    As a result of ouracquisitions, we have recorded various intangible assets, including customer relationships and developed technologies. During fiscal 2007, we acquired INTRINSIC Semiconductor Corporation and COTCO, resulting in $63.7 million of amortizableintangible assets principally composed of customer relationships and developed technology. In fiscal 2008, we acquired LLF, resulting in an additional $41.2 million of amortizable intangible assets. These intangible assets are principally composedof developed technology that specifically relates to technologies underlying the development of LED lighting products for the general illumination market.

As such, we dispose of a certain level of our equipment in the normal course of business as ourproduction processes change due to production improvement initiatives or product mix changes. Due to the risk of technological obsolescence or changes in our production process, we regularly review our equipment      28     for possible impairments in value. The following table sets forth our loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets (in thousands, except percentages):                                             Fiscal Years Ended        Year-Over-Year Change             June 26, 2011        June 27, 2010        June 28, 2009        2010 to 2011        2009 to 2010        Loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets, net      $  1,952         $  4,141         $  6,776         $  (2,189  )        53  %      $  (2,635  )        39  %      Percent of revenue         0  %         1  %         1  %                             We recorded a net loss of $2.0 million on the disposal of long-lived assets in fiscal 2011 compared to anet loss of $4.1 million in fiscal 2010. The causes of the fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 net losses include the disposal of equipment due to manufacturing process changes and the impairment of certain capitalized patent costs.   We recorded a loss of $4.1 million on the disposal of long-lived assets in fiscal 2010 compared to a loss of $6.8 million in fiscal 2009.The fiscal 2009 loss is composed of losses due to the impairment of certain equipment due to manufacturing process changes, the impairment of capitalized patent costs and losses on the disposal of equipment.   Non-Operating Income    The following table sets forth our non-operating income (in thousands, except percentages):                                              Fiscal Years Ended         Year-Over-Year Change             June 26, 2011         June 27, 2010         June 28, 2009         2010 to 2011        2009 to 2010        Other non-operating income      $  993          $  294          $  281          $  699             238  %      $  13            5  %      Interest income, net         8,528             7,400             8,796             1,128             15  %         (1,396  )        16  %                                                                                                                             Total      $  9,521          $  7,694          $  9,077          $  1,827             24  %      $  (1,383  )        15  %                                                                                                                            We have no debt or lines of credit and we are in a net interest income position. We have historicallyinvested portions of our available cash in fixed interest rate securities such as high-grade corporate debt, commercial paper, government securities, municipal bonds, and other fixed interest rate investments. The primary objective of our investmentpolicy is preservation of principal.    For fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we did not have any significant gains or lossesrealized from the sale of our investments.    Net interest income was $8.5 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $7.4 million and$8.8 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Year over year changes in interest income are due to a combination of fluctuations in interest rates on our cash and investments and differences between the periods in our average cash andinvestment balances.    Other non-operating income, net, is comprised primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses.      29     Income Tax Expense    The following table sets forth our income tax expense in dollars and our effective tax rate from continuing operations (in thousands, except percentages):                                             Fiscal Years Ended        Year-Over-Year Change             June 26, 2011        June 27, 2010        June 28, 2009        2010 to 2011        2009 to 2010        Income tax expense      $  31,727         $  53,182         $  9,017         $  (21,455  )        40  %      $  44,165             490  %      Effective tax rate on continuing operations         18  %         26  %         23  %                              We recorded income tax expense of $31.7 million from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 as compared toincome tax expense of $53.2 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 26% in fiscal 2010 to 18% in fiscal 2011 is primarily due to a change in the mix of pre-tax income from various tax jurisdictions, primarily mainlandChina and Hong Kong, and the new tax holiday in Malaysia with respect to our subcontract manufacturing and distribution operations. The increase in the effective tax rate from 23% in fiscal 2009 to 26% in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the mix ofpre-tax income from various tax jurisdictions. For further discussion of changes in our effective tax rate, please refer to Note 12, Income Taxes, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.   The variation between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% is primarily due to the consolidation of ourforeign operations, which are generally subject to income taxes at lower statutory rates. A change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions can have a significant impact on our periodic effective tax rate. In addition, oureffective tax rate may be negatively impacted by the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits (credits) that accumulate in our equity as additional paid-in-capital (APIC) and referred to as the APIC pool of credits. In situations where ourrealized tax deductions for certain stock based compensation awards, such as non-qualified stock options and restricted stock, are less than those originally anticipated, which accumulate in the APIC pool, U.S. GAAP requires that we record thedifference as an increase to income tax expense.    Liquidity and Capital Resources   Overview    Werequire cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for research and development, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand,marketable investments and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations has been one of our fundamental strengths and has provided us with substantial flexibility in meeting our operating, financing and investingneeds. We have no debt or lines of credit and have minimal lease commitments. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations and our ability to access capitalmarkets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, contractual obligations, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next 12months.    From time to time, we evaluate strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions, divestitures or investmentsin complementary businesses and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations. We may also access       30     capital markets through the issuance of new debt or additional shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets or for otherstrategic opportunities.    Contractual Obligations    At June 26, 2011, payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows (in thousands):                                                Payments due by period        Contractual Obligations      Total         Less than One Year         One to Three Years         Three to Five Years         More Than Five Years        Long-term debt obligations      $              $              $              $              $             Capital lease obligations                                                                                Operating lease obligations         7,910             2,664             3,455             1,791                        Purchase obligations         181,633             167,236             8,736             4,128             1,533         Other long-term liabilities         4,296             2,718             1,578                                                                                                                              Total      $  193,839          $  172,618          $  13,769          $  5,919          $  1,533                                                                                               Operating leases include rental amounts due on leases of certain office and manufacturing space under theterms of non-cancelable operating leases. These leases expire at various times through November 2015. All of the lease agreements provide for rental adjustments for increases in base rent, property taxes and general property maintenance that wouldbe recorded as rent expense, if applicable.    Purchase obligations generally relate to the purchase of goods and services inthe ordinary course of business such as raw materials, supplies and capital equipment. Our purchase obligations represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.   Other long-term liabilities represents liabilities related to uncertain tax positions.   Financial Condition    The following table sets forth our cash, cash equivalents and investments (in thousands):                              June 26, 2011         June 27, 2010         Change        Cash and cash equivalents      $  390,598          $  397,431          $  (6,833  )      Short-term investments         695,199             668,974             26,225                                                              Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments      $  1,085,797          $  1,066,405          $  19,392                                                             Our liquidity and capital resources depend on our cash flows from operations and our working capital. Ourworking capital increased to $1,316.6 million as of June 26, 2011 from $1,235.1 million at June 27, 2010, primarily due to an increase in inventory. The following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle:                             June 26, 2011        June 27, 2010        Change        Days of sales outstanding (a)         44            40            4         Days of supply in inventory (b)         106            76            30         Days in accounts payable (c )         (46  )         (43  )         (3  )                                                         Cash conversion cycle         104            73            31                                                              31       a)  Days of sales outstanding (DSO) calculates the average collection period of our receivables. DSO is based on the ending net trade receivables and the revenue for thequarter then ended. DSO is calculated by adding ending accounts receivable, net of applicable allowances and reserves, and dividing that sum by the average net revenue per day for the respective quarter.        b)  Days of supply in inventory (DSI) measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DSI is based on ending inventory and cost of goods soldfor the quarter then ended. DSI is calculated by dividing inventory by average cost of goods sold per day for the respective quarter.         c)  Days in accounts payable (DPO) calculates the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment. DPO is based on ending accounts payable and cost ofgoods sold for the quarter then ended. DPO is calculated by dividing accounts payable by the average cost of goods sold per day for the respective quarter.    Overall our cash conversion cycle, or days to cash, increased primarily due to an increase in inventory on hand. The increase in inventory is primarily related to our building product in response to ahigher demand forecast than our actual results.    As of June 26, 2011, substantially all of our investments had investmentgrade ratings, and any such investments that were in an unrealized loss position at June 26, 2011 were in such position due to interest rate changes, sector credit rating changes or company-specific rating changes. As we intend and believe thatwe have the ability to hold such investments for a period of time that will be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value, we currently expect to receive the full principal or recover our cost basis in these securities. When evaluating ourinvestments for possible impairment, we review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below our cost basis, the financial condition of the entity in which the investment is made, and our ability and intent to holdthe investment for a period of time that may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. The declines in value of the securities in our portfolio are considered to be temporary in nature and, accordingly, we do not believe thesesecurities are impaired as of June 26, 2011.    We believe our current working capital and anticipated cash flows fromoperations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and capital expenditures for fiscal 2012. We have and may continue to use a portion of our available cash and cash equivalents, or funds underlying our marketablesecurities, to repurchase shares of our common stock. With our strong working capital position, we believe that we have the ability to continue to invest in further development of our products and, when necessary or appropriate, make selectiveacquisitions or other strategic investments to strengthen our product portfolio, secure key intellectual properties, or expand our production capacity.    Cash Flows    In summary, our cash flows were as follows (inthousands):                                      Fiscal Years Ended        Year-Over-Year Change             June 26, 2011        June 27, 2010        June 28, 2009        2010 to 2011        2009 to 2010        Cash provided by operating activities      $  251,380         $  250,569         $  177,919         $  811         $  72,650         Cash used in investing activities         (303,234  )         (763,387  )         (174,843  )         460,153            (588,544  )      Cash provided by financing activities         44,546            619,799            24,651            (575,253  )         595,148         Effect of foreign exchange changes         475            296            794            179            (498  )                                                                                         Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents      $  (6,833  )      $  107,277         $  28,521         $  (114,110  )      $  78,756                                                                                           The following is a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash in our operating, investing andfinancing activities.       32     Cash Flows from Operating Activities   Cash provided by operating activities was relatively unchanged year over year, from $250.6 million in fiscal 2010 to $251.4 million infiscal 2011.    Cash provided by operating activities increased to $250.6 million in fiscal 2010 from $177.9 million in fiscal2009. The increase is primarily due to higher year over year net income, offset in part due to larger receivable and inventory balances to support higher sales volumes.    Cash Flows from Investing Activities    Our investing activities primarilyrelate to transactions within our investments, strategic acquisitions, purchase of property, plant and equipment and purchase of patent and license rights. Net cash used in investing activities was $303.2 million for fiscal 2011 compared to $763.4million for fiscal 2010. This year over year decrease was primarily the result of an overall net decrease in short term investment purchase activity and payment of contingent consideration related to our COTCO acquisition. This decrease waspartially offset by an increase in our current year capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment to expand our global production capacity and proceeds from maturities of investments.   Net cash used in investing activities was $763.4 million for fiscal 2010 compared to $174.8 million for fiscal 2009. This year over yearincrease was primarily due to an increase in cash available for investments as a result of the issuance and sale of 12.65 million shares of common stock, with net proceeds of approximately $434 million and a year over year increase in the amount ofcash received from employee stock option exercises. In addition, we increased capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capacity to meet the needs of our anticipated growth.   We will continue to closely monitor our capital expenditures, while making strategic investments to develop our existing products, pursuestrategic initiatives where appropriate and invest in our manufacturing and information technology infrastructure to meet the needs of our business. We target committing capital of approximately $160 million in fiscal 2012 for capital expenditures.   Cash Flows from Financing Activities    Net cash provided by financing activities was $44.5 million for fiscal 2011 compared to $619.8 million for fiscal 2010. This year over year decrease was primarily related to our sale of 12.65 millionshares of our common stock in a follow-on public offering during fiscal 2010, with net proceeds of approximately $434 million.   Net cash provided by financing activities was $619.8 million for fiscal 2010 compared to $24.7 million for fiscal 2009. This year overyear increase was primarily due to the issuance and sale of 12.65 million shares of common stock, with net proceeds of approximately $434 million and a year over year increase in the amount of cash received from employee stock option exercises.   As of June 26, 2011, up to $200 million of our common stock remained approved for repurchase under the repurchaseprogram authorized by our Board of Directors. Since the inception of our stock repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 9.8 million shares of our common stock. At the discretion of our management, the repurchase program can beimplemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions. We will determine the time and extent of repurchases based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors.    Fair Value    Under accounting principles generally accepted in the UnitedStates (U.S. GAAP), fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S.GAAP also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputsare obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas, unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third       33     party would use in pricing an asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:                  Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that we are able to access. Since valuations are based onquoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.                  Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar, or quoted prices in markets that are not active foridentical or similar instruments, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.                  Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.   The financial assets for which we perform recurring fair value remeasurements are cash equivalents and short-term investments. Thefinancial assets for which we may be required to perform non-recurring fair value remeasurements (e.g., an impairment of assets) are any investments in privately-held companies. As of June 26, 2011, financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputsincluded money market funds. Financial assets utilizing Level 2 inputs included corporate bonds, municipal bonds, certificates of deposit, variable rate demand notes, non-U.S. government securities, commercial paper, and U.S. agency securities.Level 2 assets are valued using a third-party pricing services consensus price which is a weighted average price based on multiple sources. These sources determine prices utilizing market income models which factor in, where applicable, transactionsof similar assets in active markets, transactions of identical assets in infrequent markets, interest rates, bond or credit default swap spreads and volatility. We do not have any significant financial assets requiring the use of Level 3 inputs.Please refer to Note 6, Fair Value of Financial Instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information.    Financial and Market Risks    We are exposed to financial and market risks,including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodities risk. We currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks; however, we may choose to do so in the future. All of the potential changesnoted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at June 26, 2011 and June 27, 2010. Actual results may differ materially.    Interest Rates    We maintain an investment portfolio principallycomposed of high-grade corporate debt, commercial paper, government securities, and other investments at fixed interest rates that vary by security. In order to minimize risk, our cash management policy permits us to acquire investments ratedAA grade or better. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in quoted market price of our investments was approximately $69.5 million at June 26, 2011 and $66.9 million at June 27, 2010.   Currency Exchange Rates    As we operate internationally and have transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we are exposed to currency exchange rate risks. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect ourexpenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Our primary exposures relate to the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the Chinese Renminbi (CNY). The potential loss in fair value resulting from ahypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi was approximately $2.6 million at June 26, 2011 and $1.7 million at June 27, 2010.       34     Commodities    We utilize significant amounts of precious metals, gasses and other commodities in our manufacturing processes. General economic conditions, market specific changes or other factors outside of our controlmay affect the pricing of these commodities. We do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices.    Off-Balance SheetArrangements    We do not use off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties, nor do we useother forms of off-balance sheet arrangements. Accordingly, our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off-balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities. As of June 26, 2011, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, asdefined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.    We have entered into operating leases primarily for certain of ourU.S. and international facilities in the normal course of business. These arrangements are often referred to as a form of off-balance-sheet financing. Future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of June 26, 2011 are detailedabove in Liquidity and Capital Resources in the section entitled Contractual Obligations.    Critical AccountingPolicies and Estimates    Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the applicationof U.S. GAAP we are required to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Changes in theaccounting estimates from period to period are reasonably likely to occur. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates andactual results, our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.    On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of stock based compensation, valuation of long-lived assets, tax related contingencies, valuationof inventories, contingencies and litigation, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, including expected trends, that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of whichform the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.    In addition to making critical accounting estimates, we must ensure that our financial statements are properly stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particulartransaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require a high degree of management judgment in its application, while in other cases, managements judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accountingstandards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions.    Our significant accounting policies arediscussed in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We believe that the following are our most criticalaccounting policies and estimates, each of which is critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Our management has reviewed our critical accountingpolicies and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.    Revenue Recognition   We recognize product revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by persuasive evidence of an arrangement, typically inthe form of a purchase order, when the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of revenue       35     is reasonably assured, and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.    For the year ended June 26, 2011, 44% of our product sales were made to distributors. Distributors stock inventory and sell our products to their own customer base, which may include: value addedresellers; manufacturers who incorporate our products into their own manufactured goods; or ultimate end users of our products. We recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to our distributors. This arrangement is often referred to as asell-in or point-of-purchase model as opposed to a sell-through or point-of-sale model, where revenue is deferred and not recognized until the distributor sells the product through to their customer.   Our distributors may be provided limited rights that allow them to return a portion of inventory (Product Exchange Rights orStock Rotation Rights) and receive credits for changes in selling prices (Price Protection Rights) or other targeted sales incentives. When determining our net revenue, we make significant judgments and estimates corresponding with productshipments. We record a reserve for estimated future returns, changes in selling prices, and other targeted sales incentives when product ships. We also record an asset for the estimated value of product returns that we believe will be returned toinventory in the future and resold, and these estimates are based upon historical data, current economic trends, distributor inventory levels and other related factors. Our financial condition and operating results are dependent upon our ability tomake reliable estimates. Actual results may vary and could have a significant impact on our operating results.    Inventories   We write-down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and itsestimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand, specifically known inventory-related risks (such as technological obsolescence), and assumptions about future demand. We also analyze sales levels by product type,including historical and estimated future customer demand for those products to determine if any additional reserves are appropriate. For example, we adjust for items that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand, manufacturingprocess changes or new product introductions that may eliminate demand for the product. Any adjustment to our inventory as a result of an estimated obsolescence or net realizable condition is reflected as a component of our cost of sales. At thepoint of the loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and any subsequent improvements in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.   In order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we determine normal capacity for our manufacturingfacilities based on historical patterns. If our estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate, or market conditions or technology change in ways that are less favorable than those projected by management, we may be required to take excesscapacity charges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.    Deferred TaxAsset Valuation Allowances    In assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance, we consider all positive andnegative evidence and a variety of factors including historical and projected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. When we establish or increase a valuation allowance, our income tax expense increases in the periodsuch determination is made. If we decrease a valuation allowance, our income tax expense decreases in the period such a determination is made.   Tax Contingencies   We are subject to periodic audits of our income tax returns by federal, state and local agencies. The audits include questions regardingour tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740,Income Taxes (ASC 740), we evaluate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit should not be recognized for financial statement purposes for an uncertain tax filing position where itis not more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%) for being sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.    In accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, we have recorded unrecognized tax benefits (as a reduction to the deferred tax asset or as an increase to other liabilities) to remove some or all of the taxbenefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position is more likelythan not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether ornot a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such aslegislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position, and (3) each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset oraggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.   A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and fullyresolved. To the extent we prevail in matters for which we have recorded an unrecognized benefit or are required to pay amounts in excess of what we have recorded our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materiallyaffected. An unfavorable tax settlement might require use of our cash and/or result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in theyear of resolution.    Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   We account for awards of stock-based compensation under our employee stock-based compensation plans using the fair value method.Accordingly, we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock-based awards and amortize this fair value to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term. To estimate the fair value of our stock option awards we currentlyuse the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our then current stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complexand subjective variables. These variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.   Due to the inherent limitations of option-valuation models available today, including future events that are unpredictable and theestimation process utilized in determining the valuation of the stock-based awards, the ultimate value realized by award holders may vary significantly from the amounts expensed in our financial statements. For restricted stock awards, grant datefair value is based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant. This fair value is then amortized to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term.   We estimate expected forfeitures at the time of grant and revise this estimate, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeituresdiffer from initial estimates. Our determination of an estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based upon a review of historical experience but may also include consideration of other facts and circumstances we believe are indicative of futureactivity. The assessment of an estimated forfeiture rate will not alter the total compensation expense to be recognized, only the timing of this recognition as compensation expense is adjusted to reflect instruments that actually vest.   If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating key assumptions, we may be required to adjustcompensation expense, which could be material to our results of operations.    Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets       36     Our assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets involves significant judgment andestimation. These assessments reflect our assumptions, which, we believe, are consistent with the assumptions hypothetical marketplace participants use. Factors that we must estimate when performing recoverability and impairment tests include, amongothers, the economic life of the asset, sales volumes, prices, cost of capital, tax rates, and capital spending. These factors are often interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation.   We evaluate long-lived assets such as property, equipment and definite lived intangible assets, such as patents, for impairment wheneverevents or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets recorded in our financial statements may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider include whether there has been a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, asignificant change in the way an asset is being used, or a significant change, delay or departure in our strategy for that asset. If impairment is indicated we first determine if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis areless than the carrying amounts of the asset or assets. If so, an impairment loss is measured and recorded.    After animpairment loss is recognized, a new, lower cost basis for that long-lived asset is established. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss.   Our impairment loss calculations require that we apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, includingestimating useful lives of the assets. To make these judgments, we may use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value.   If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, wemay be required to record additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.    Goodwill   We test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events that mayindicate potential impairment. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level using a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unitexceeds its carrying value, no impairment is recorded. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment analysis is performed. The second step is used to measure the amount of the impairment lossand compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for theexcess. However, it should be noted that the loss recognized shall not be in excess of the carrying amount. Once a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying value shall be its new accounting basis.       37     Contingent Liabilities   We provide for contingent liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, a loss contingency is charged to incomewhen (1) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.   Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter to assess the potential financial exposure. If a potential loss isconsidered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we reflect the estimated loss in our results of operations. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired andwhether such loss is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. Further, estimates of this nature are highly subjective, and the final      38     outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In determining the probability of an unfavorableoutcome of a particular contingent liability and whether such liability is reasonably estimable, we consider the individual facts and circumstances related to the liability, opinions of legal counsel and recent legal rulings by the appropriateregulatory bodies, among other factors. As additional information becomes available, we reassesses the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates accordingly. Such revisions in the estimates ofthe potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
