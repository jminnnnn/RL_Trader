ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW           The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein.           The Company is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT which owns, operates, develops and finances manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern United States. As of December 31, 2003, the Company owned and operated a portfolio of 127 developed properties located in seventeen states, including 115 manufactured housing communities, five recreational vehicle communities, and seven properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites.           During 2003, the Company acquired one manufactured housing community located in East Lansing, Michigan, comprising 62 developed sites and 182 sites suitable for development for $4.5 million, and the Company sold four manufactured housing communities located in Michigan and Illinois which comprised 731 sites for $24.8 million.           The Company has been experiencing increased vacancies due primarily to the glut of repossessed homes caused by lax credit standards in the mid to late 1990's. As lenders recognize their problems and repossess homes, the Company's vacancies rise. Industry estimates are that such conditions are abating and the number of repossessed homes in 2004 will approximate 60,000, roughly one-half of the number in recent years. This abatement should have positive effects on new home sales which fill sites in the Company's communities.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES           Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements. Nevertheless, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.           Management believes the following significant accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:           Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Rental property is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Management evaluates the recoverability of its investment in rental property whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as recent operating results, expected net operating cash flow and plans for future operations, indicate that full asset recoverability is questionable. If such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement, the impairment that would be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined on a discounted net cash flow basis.                                         28            Notes Receivable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its notes receivable whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The loan is then measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flow discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.           Depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company uses a thirty year useful life for land improvements and buildings and a seven to fifteen year useful life for furniture, fixtures and equipment.           Revenue Recognition. Rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight-line basis when earned from tenants. Leases entered into by tenants generally range from month-to-month to one year and are renewable by mutual agreement of the Company and the resident.           Capitalized Costs. The Company capitalizes certain costs (including interest and other costs) incurred in connection with the development, redevelopment, capital enhancement and leasing of its properties. Management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization. The amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities. Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred. Renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete. Certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period; shorter than the average resident's occupancy in the home and the average term that the home is in our community. Costs associated with implementing the Company's new computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware.           Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company has entered into three interest rate swap agreements to offset interest rate risk. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. The Company adjusts its balance sheet on an ongoing quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of its derivatives. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income, as appropriate. The ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged. The unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings over time and occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings. The Company uses standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments, including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized.           Deferred Tax Assets. SHS currently has significant deferred tax assets, which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments. SHS has recognized deferred tax assets of $2.0 million, net of a valuation reserve of $3.0 million. Realization of these deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon SHS's achievement of expected future taxable income. Judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, SHS's ability to continue to successfully execute its business plan, and other factors.                                          29            Income Taxes. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT as defined under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the Company's gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes at least ninety percent (90%) of its REIT ordinary taxable income to its stockholders, which it fully intends to do. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Company remains subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property as well as Federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Comparison of year ended December 31, 2003 to year ended December 31, 2002           For the year ended December 31, 2003, income from operations increased by $3.8 million from $21.6 million to $25.4 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was due to increased revenues of $29.0 million and increased results from affiliates of $17.3 million partially offset by increased expenses of $42.5 million. The year 2003 included SHS on a consolidated basis as discussed below.           Income from rental property increased by $9.2 million from $149.9 million to $159.1 million, or 6.2 percent, due to rent increases and other community revenues ($3.4 million) and acquisitions ($5.8 million).           Interest income increased by $3.4 million from $8.0 million to $11.4 million, or 42.1 percent, due principally to larger outstanding balances of notes and investments at higher rates of interest.           Other operating income decreased by $6.6 million from $2.3 million to ($4.3) million, due primarily to reduced development fee income and a $4.9 million write down of an impaired asset.           The remaining revenue increases of $22.9 million relate to the consolidation of Sun Home Services which is discussed in detail below.           Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $6.1 million from $33.7 million to $39.8 million, or 18.0 percent. The increase was primarily due to increases in utility costs ($1.8 million) and increases in repair and maintenance expenses ($1.3 million). Acquisitions during 2002 and the consolidation of SunChamp properties accounted for the remaining increase of $3.0 million.           Real estate taxes increased by $1.5 million from $10.2 million to $11.7 million, or 15.0 percent due to acquisitions made in 2002 ($0.7 million) and increases in assessments and tax rate ($0.8 million).           Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $10.4 million from $7.7 million to $18.1 million, due to the consolidation of Sun Home Services ($7.6 million), professional fees ($0.4 million), expenses related to office relocation ($0.2 million), Michigan Single Business tax ($0.2 million), compensation expenses, including benefits, primarily related                                         30   to the SunChamp acquisition and a systems conversion ($1.7 million), and assorted other minor increases ($0.3 million).           Depreciation and amortization increased by $6.2 million from $37.9 million to $44.1 million, or 16.4 percent, due primarily to the consolidation of Sun Home Services ($1.0 million) and additional investment in rental property.           Interest expense increased by $4.3 million from $32.4 million to $36.7 million, or 13.3 percent, due to increased debt levels partially offset by lower interest rates ($1.5 million), decreased capitalized interest ($0.8 million), an increase in financing costs ($0.6 million), and an increase in interest rates related to fixing rates on $75.0 million of debt ($2.7 million). These increases were partially offset by $1.3 million of income related primarily to the change in market value of an interest rate swap contract that does not qualify for hedge accounting.           Equity income from affiliates of $0.7 million represents the Company's one-third interest in the operations of Origen for its initial operating period after a recapitalization in October, 2003.           The remaining expense increase of $13.9 million relates to the consolidation of Sun Home Services which is discussed in detail below.  Sun Home Services           Prior to January 1, 2003, the results of operations of Sun Home Services were accounted for using the equity method and reported as a single line item called equity in income from affiliates. As the Company is the primary beneficiary of the results of operations of Sun Home Services, it is appropriate to consolidate Sun Home Services at December 31, 2003. This has no effect on previously reported net income.           The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for Sun Home Services for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002:                                                                        INCREASE/                                        2003           2002         (DECREASE)     PERCENT CHANGE                                     ---------     ----------        ---------     --------------                                                   (Pro Forma)          New home sales revenues              $13,169        $15,890        $(2,721)          (17.1%) Cost of sales                          9,159         12,907         (3,748)          (29.0%)                                      -------        -------        -------           ----- Gross profit                           4,010          2,983          1,027            34.4%                                      =======        =======        =======           =====  Pre-owned home sales revenues        $ 6,347        $ 3,214        $ 3,133            97.5% Cost of sales                          4,720          2,586          2,134            82.5%                                      -------        -------        -------           ----- Gross profit                           1,627            628            999           159.1%                                      =======        =======        =======           =====  Ancillary revenue, net               $ 3,409        $ 1,519        $ 1,890           124.4%                                      =======        =======        =======           =====  Home sales volumes:      New homes                           257            286            (29)         (10.1%)      Pre-owned homes                     283            174            109           62.6%            New home sales declined by 10.1 percent, while revenues and costs of sales declined by                                         31   17.1 and 29.0 percent, respectively. Gross profit increased by 34.4 percent as cost of sales declined by more than revenues due to the purchase of new homes at a substantial discount. Pre-owned home unit sales increased by 62.6 percent while revenues and cost of sales increased by 97.5 percent and 82.5 percent, respectively. Gross profit increased by 159.1 percent as revenues grew more than cost of sales due to strong demand for the value in pre-owned homes.           The increase in ancillary revenue, net, is primarily due to increased activity in the Company's rental home program.  Comparison of year ended December 31, 2002 to year ended December 31, 2001           For the year ended December 31, 2002, income from operations decreased by $20.0 million from $41.6 million to $21.6 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease was due to increased expenses of $12.5 million, increased revenues of $9.2 million and increased loss from affiliates of $16.7 million as described in more detail below.           Income from rental property increased by $12.9 million from $137.0 million to $149.9 million, or 9.4 percent, due to rent increases and other community revenues ($5.9 million) and acquisitions ($7.0 million).           Interest income decreased by $2.3 million from $10.3 million to $8.0 million, or 22.5 percent, due primarily to a decrease in interest earning notes and receivables.           Other income decreased by $1.4 million from $3.7 million to $2.3 million, or 37.8 percent, due primarily to reduced development fee income.           Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $4.4 million from $29.3 million to $33.7 million, or 15.0 percent, due to acquired communities ($1.9 million) and increases in costs including payroll ($1.2 million), workers' compensation ($0.5 million), and cable television ($0.3 million), and other expenses ($0.5 million).           Real estate taxes increased by $1.0 million from $9.2 million to $10.2 million, or 11.5 percent due to acquired communities ($0.5 million) and changes in certain assessments.           General and administrative expenses increased by $0.3 million from $7.4 million to $7.7 million, representing 4.8 percent and 4.9 percent of total revenues in 2002 and 2001, respectively.           Depreciation and amortization increased by $5.2 million from $32.7 million to $37.9 million, due primarily to the net additional investments in rental properties.                 Interest expense increased by $1.4 million from $31.0 million to $32.4 million due primarily to financing additional investments in rental property ($6.0 million), offset by decreasing rates on variable rate debt ($4.9 million).                 Equity loss from affiliates increased by $16.7 million from income of $0.1 million to a loss of $16.6 million primarily due to equity losses at SHS ($0.7 million), SunChamp ($0.4 million) and Origen ($1.7 million) and the valuation adjustment of the Company's investment in Origen ($13.6 million) and a technology investment ($0.3 million).                                         32   SAME PROPERTY INFORMATION           The following table reflects property-level financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The "Same Property" data represents information regarding the operation of communities owned as of January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003. Site, occupancy, and rent data for those communities is presented as of the last day of each period presented. The "Total Portfolio" column differentiates from the "Same Property" column by including financial information for properties acquired after January 1, 2002 and new development communities.

(2)      Investors in and analysts following the real estate industry utilize          net operating income ("NOI") as a supplemental performance measure. The          Company considers NOI, given its wide use by and relevance to investors          and analysts, an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because          NOI provides a measure of rental operations and does not factor in          depreciation/amortization and non-property specific expenses such as          general and administrative expenses.  (3)      Same property information does not include properties sold during the          year ended December 31, 2003.           On a same property basis, property net operating income increased by $0.6 million from $97.3 million to $97.9 million, or 0.6 percent. Income from property increased by $3.1 million from $132.1 million to $135.2 million, or 2.3 percent, due primarily to increases in rents including water and property tax pass through.  Property operating expenses increased by $1.8 million from $24.9 million to $26.7 million, or 7.2 percent, due to increases in real estate taxes ($0.7 million), repair and maintenance ($0.9 million), and payroll ($0.2 million).                                         33   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           The Company's principal liquidity demands have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, distributions to the Company's stockholders and the Operating Partnership's unitholders, property acquisitions, development and expansion of properties, capital improvements of properties and debt repayment.           The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through its working capital provided by operating activities and its line of credit, as described below. The Company considers its ability to generate cash from operations (anticipated to be approximately $70 million) to be adequate to meet all operating requirements, including recurring capital improvements, routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature, pay dividends to its stockholders to maintain qualification as a REIT in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and make distributions to the Operating Partnership's unitholders.           The Company plans to invest approximately $5.0 million in developments consisting of expansions to existing communities and the continuing development of new communities. The Company expects to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit.           Furthermore, the Company expects to invest in the range of $20.0 to $40.0 million in the acquisition of individual properties in 2004, depending upon market conditions. The Company plans to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit.           Cash and cash equivalents increased by $21.4 million to $24.1 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $2.7 million at December 31, 2002 due to the net proceeds received from the sale of four properties. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $12.3 million to $63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from increased net income, higher depreciation, the effect of consolidating SHS, and changes in other miscellaneous asset and liabilities accounts.           The Company's net cash flows provided by operating activities may be adversely impacted by, among other things: (a) the market and economic conditions in the Company's markets; (b) lower occupancy rates of the Properties; (c) increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, real estate taxes and utilities, that cannot be passed on to the Company's tenants; and (d) decreased sales of manufactured homes. See "Factors that May Affect Future Results."           In October 2003, the Company acquired a community in East Lansing, MI and financed the acquisition with a mortgage for $2.3 million and the remainder in cash.           The Company entered into a $25 million loan facility in September of 2003, of which $25 million was available to be borrowed at December 31, 2003. Borrowings bear an interest rate of Federal Funds Effective Rate plus .85% and mature on March 24, 2004.           In April 2003 the Company issued $150 million of 5.75 percent senior notes, due April 15, 2010, and used the proceeds from the offering to retire the bridge loan of $48 million and senior notes of $85 million which matured on April 30 and May 1, 2003, respectively. The remaining proceeds paid down the Company's line of credit.                                         34                The Company has a $105 million unsecured line of credit facility, which matures in July 2005, with a one-year optional extension. At December 31, 2003, the average interest rate of outstanding borrowings under the line of credit was 2.05%, $99 million was outstanding and $6 million was available to be drawn under the facility. The line of credit facility contains various leverage, debt service coverage, net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2003.               The Company's primary long-term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness. At December 31, 2003, the Company's outstanding contractual obligations were as follows:                                                                                 PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD                                                                                   (IN THOUSANDS)                                                          -------------------------------------------------------------- CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS           TOTAL DUE          1 YEAR         2-3 YEARS        4-5 YEARS       AFTER 5 YEARS                                        ----------        ---------    ---------------     ---------       -------------            Line of credit                          $ 99,000         $      -         $ 99,000         $      -         $      - Collateralized term loan                  41,547              706            1,569           39,272                - Collateralized term loan - FNMA          152,363                -                -                -          152,363 Senior notes (1)                         350,000                -           65,000          135,000          150,000 Mortgage notes, other                     62,664           24,823           12,276            8,008           17,557 Capitalized lease obligations              9,606            9,606                -                -                - Redeemable Preferred OP Units             58,148                -            8,176            4,500           45,472                                         --------         --------         --------         --------         --------                                         $773,328         $ 35,135         $186,021         $186,780         $365,392                                         ========         ========         ========         ========         ========   (1)      The provisions of the callable/redeemable $65 million notes are such          that the maturity date will likely be 2005 if the 10-year treasury rate          is greater than 5.7% on May 16, 2005. The maturity is reflected in the          above table based on that assumption.           The Company anticipates meeting its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled debt maturities, large property acquisitions and Operating Partnership unit redemptions, through the issuance of debt or equity securities, including equity units in the Operating Partnership, or from selective asset sales. Since 1993, the Company has raised, in the aggregate, nearly $1 billion from the sale of shares of its common stock, from the sale of OP units in the Operating Partnership, and the issuance of secured and unsecured debt securities. In addition, at December 31, 2003, 92 of the Properties were unencumbered by debt, therefore, providing substantial financial flexibility. The ability of the Company to finance its long-term liquidity requirements in such manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time, including the availability and cost of mortgage debt, the financial condition of the Company, the operating history of the Properties, the state of the debt and equity markets, and the general national, regional and local economic conditions. See "Factors that May Affect Future Results". If the Company is unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing on acceptable terms, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed.                                         35           Included in debt are $35.8 million of Preferred OP Units which would require collateralization were the Company to no longer be classified as investment grade by the rating agencies.           At December 31, 2003, the Company's debt to total market capitalization approximated 46.0 percent (assuming conversion of all Common OP Units to shares of common stock). The debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.2 years and a weighted average interest rate of 5.4 percent.           Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 included recurring capital expenditures of $6.5 million (excluding $1.7 million related to a main office relocation and $3.4 million related to a software conversion) and $7.1 million, respectively.           Net cash used in investing activities was $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $168.9 million in the prior year. The differences are due to: decreased investment in rental properties of $37.0 million; increased proceeds from property disposition of $19.3 million; increased repayments of notes receivables of $49.5 million; and decreased investment in and advances to affiliates of $4.2 million. Included in proceeds from property dispositions is $22.5 million of proceeds deposited with an intermediary for Section 1031 exchange purposes. These sales proceeds will be disbursed as the Company exchanges properties under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.           Net cash provided by financing activities was $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $116.0 million in the prior year. The differences were primarily due to changes in net proceeds from notes payable, inclusive of borrowings on line of credit, of $109.6 million, increased distributions of $2.4 million, offset by changes in net proceeds from common stock issuance of $12.4 million and changes in payments of deferred financing costs of $0.6 million.  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES           The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 was 1.29:1, 1.68:1 and 1.73:1 respectively.  INFLATION           Most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease expires. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.                                         36   SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT           This Form 10-K contains various "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Company intends that such forward-looking statements will be subject to the safe harbors created thereby.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS           In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" which establishes standards for how financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity instruments should be classified on the balance sheet. The requirements of SFAS 150 generally outline that financial instruments that give the issuer a choice of settling an obligation with a variable number of securities or settling an obligation with a transfer of assets or any mandatorily redeemable security should be classified as a liability on the balance sheet. The Company has reclassified mandatorily redeemable preferred operating partnership units of $58.1 million into debt as of December 31, 2003. The reclassification had no effect on the Company's compliance with the covenant requirements of its credit agreements.           In April 2003, FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under FASB Statements No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This Statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. In addition, all provisions of this Statement should be applied prospectively. The provisions of this Statement that relate to Statement 133 Implementation Issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003, should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates. The adoption of this Statement did not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of the operations of the Company.                                         37            In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." The objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity ("VIE") and determine when the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of operations of a VIE need to be included in a company's consolidated financial statements. A company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company's interest in the VIE is such that the company will absorb a majority of the VIE's expected losses and/or receive a majority of the VIE's expected residual returns, if they occur. FIN 46 also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders. The provisions of this interpretation apply to the end of the first interim period or annual period ending after December 15, 2003 (i.e., December 31, 2003) to VIEs in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company has consolidated SHS in its financial reporting beginning December 31, 2003.  OTHER           Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as "net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus rental property depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures." Industry analysts consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating performance of an equity REIT primarily because the computation of FFO excludes historical cost depreciation as an expense and thereby facilitates the comparison of REITs which have different cost bases in their assets. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, whereas real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen based upon market conditions. FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, FFO is not intended as a measure of a REIT's ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements, nor as a measure of working capital. The following table reconciles net income to FFO and calculates FFO data for both basic and diluted purposes for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 (in thousands):                                         38                                 SUN COMMUNITIES, INC.

The valuation adjustment reflects the theoretical          noncash profit and loss were those hedging transactions terminated at          the balance sheet date. As the Company has no expectation of          terminating the transactions prior to maturity, the net of these          noncash valuation adjustments will be zero at the various maturities.          As any imperfection related to hedging correlation in these swaps is          reflected currently in cash as interest, the valuation adjustments are          excluded from Funds from Operations. The valuation adjustment is          included in interest expense.  (2)      The Company acquired the equity interest of another investor in          SunChamp in December 2002. Consideration consisted of a long-term note          payable at net book value. Although the adjustment for the allocation          of the SunChamp losses (based on SunChamp as a stand-alone entity) is          not reflected in the accompanying financial statements, management          believes that it is appropriate to provide for this adjustment because          the Company's payment obligations with respect to the note are          subordinate in all respects to the return of the members' equity          (including the gross book value of the acquired equity) plus a          preferred return. As a result, the losses that are allocated to the          Company from SunChamp as a stand-alone entity under generally accepted          accounting principles are effectively reallocated to the note for          purposes of calculating Funds from Operations. At December 31, 2003,          the remaining balance on the SunChamp note is approximately $0.3          million.                                         39   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK           The Company's principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company mitigates this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage, minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures, which include the periodic use of derivatives. The Company's primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that changes in interest rates could have on its future cash flows. The Company generally employs derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.           The Company has entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement. One of the swap agreements fixes $25 million of variable rate borrowings at 4.93 percent for the period April 2003 through July 2009, another of the swap agreements fixes $25 million of variable rate borrowings at 5.37 percent for the period April 2003 through July 2012 and the third swap agreement, which is only effective for so long as 90-day LIBOR is 7 percent or less, fixes $25 million of variable rate borrowings at 3.97 percent for the period April 2003 through July 2007. The interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of 9.49 percent, a notional amount of $152.4 million and a termination date of April 13, 2006. Each of the Company's derivative contracts is based upon 90-day LIBOR.           The Company's remaining variable rate debt totals $196.6 million as of December 31, 2003 which bears interest at various LIBOR or FNMA Discounted Mortgage Backed Securities ("DMBS") rates. If LIBOR or DMBS increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company believes its interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $2.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, based on the $215.3 million and $171.3 million average balance outstanding under the Company's variable rate debt facilities for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.           Additionally, the Company had $32.1 million and $27.3 million LIBOR based variable rate mortgage and other notes receivable as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. If LIBOR increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company believes interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.30 million and $0.37 million, respectively, based on the $30.2 million and $36.7 million average balance outstanding on all variable rate notes receivable for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
