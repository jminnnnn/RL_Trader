ITEM  7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW        The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein.        The Company is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT which owns, operates, develops and finances manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern United States. As of December 31, 2005, the Company owned and operated a portfolio of 135 developed properties located in eighteen states, including 123 manufactured housing communities, four recreational vehicle communities, and eight properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites.        During 2005 the Company acquired one property located near Tampa, Florida for approximately $7.3 million comprised of 697 recreational vehicle sites and 31 manufactured home sites. The property was acquired for cash.        In recent years the operations of manufactured homebuilders, dealers, and the companies that finance the purchase of the homes have experienced severe losses and substantial volatility. New home shipments have declined from approximately 373,000 in 1998 to approximately 131,000 in 2005. The decline was largely due to the turmoil in the financing side of the industry as lenders experienced substantial losses arising from defaults on poorly underwritten loans in the mid to late 1990s and beyond. As a result of the losses, the lenders experienced liquidity constraints and significantly tightened underwriting standards thus reducing the demand for new homes.        These trends may be abating as the volume of repossessed homes in the market place appears to be declining. Newly repossessed homes are also declining as the reinforcing effects of tightened underwriting standards and reduced new home financing volumes impact the industry.        The effect of these trends on the Company has been to reduce occupancies in our portfolio as the demand of tenants for sites in our communities has declined for the above-stated reasons. The rate of leasing in our new community developments has likewise slowed. Despite these trends, the Company's same property portfolio has consistently reflected growth in net operating income evidencing the revenue and operating stability long associated with the business of owning and operating manufactured housing communities.        While the problems which directly impacted the manufacturers, dealers, and lenders appear to be bottoming, the Company does not expect a rapid or strong recovery in its operations. The Company expects a gradually improving leasing environment in its portfolio.        As a result of these industry conditions, a large quantity of homes repossessed by lenders have become available for purchase at discounts of up to 50% and more from original cost or loan amount. The Company has made every effort to acquire these value-priced homes especially as the alternative would likely be the removal of the homes from the community. Such removal would create total dependence on the sale of a new home to fill the site. As new home                                         30   shipments have declined by nearly two thirds from their peak in 1998 to current levels, such dependence would leave the Company vulnerable to a recovery in new home shipments as its primary method to improve occupancy.        The Company intends to sell these value-priced homes to residents over time. In the meantime it is most economical to rent the homes. At December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 3,711 homes rented in its communities which comprise over 47,000 sites. All renters are subject to underwriting criteria. The Company expects to continue to acquire homes from lenders as long as the pricing of the homes remains compelling. The Company is actively developing programs for its renters and others to acquire these homes.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES        Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements. Nevertheless, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.        Management believes the following significant accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:        Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Investment in Affiliates. Rental property is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The Company measures the recoverability of its assets in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." If such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement, the impairment that would be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined on a discounted net cash flow basis. Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances that may prompt a test of recoverability may include a significant decrease in anticipated market price, an adverse change to the extent or manner in which an asset may be used or in its physical condition or other such events that may significantly change the value of the long-lived asset. The Company has a 20 percent investment in an affiliate that is reported under the equity method of accounting. Management performs an analysis to determine if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value. Numerous factors are evaluated in accordance with published GAAP and SEC staff guidance. Changes in the facts and circumstances evaluated, future adverse changes in market conditions or operating results of the affiliate may affect management's analysis.                                         31         Notes and Accounts Receivable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its receivables whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan and lease agreements. The ability to collect notes receivable is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flow discounted at the note's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the note is collateral dependent. Receivables related to community rents are reserved when the Company believes that collection is less than probable.        Depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives are 30 years for land improvements and buildings and 7 to 15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. The Company prospectively adopted a change in the estimated service lives of homes in its rental program from 40, 35 or 20 years to 10 years.        Revenue Recognition. Rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight-line basis when earned from tenants. Leases entered into by tenants generally range from month-to-month to one year and are renewable by mutual agreement of the Company and the resident or, in some cases, as provided by state statute. Revenue from the sale of manufactured homes is recognized upon transfer of title at the closing of the sales transaction.        Capitalized Costs. The Company capitalizes certain costs (including interest and other costs) incurred in connection with the development, redevelopment, capital enhancement and leasing of its properties. Management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization. The amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities. Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred. Renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete. Costs incurred to renovate repossessed homes for the Company's rental program are capitalized and costs incurred to refurbish the homes at turnover and repair the homes while occupied are expensed. Certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period. Costs associated with implementing the Company's computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware.        Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company has entered into three interest rate swap agreements to offset interest rate risk. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. The Company adjusts its balance sheet on an ongoing quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of its derivatives. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income, as appropriate. The ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged. The unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings over time and occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings. The Company uses standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments, including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized.                                         32         Income Taxes. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT as defined under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the Company's gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes at least ninety percent (90%) of its REIT ordinary taxable income to its stockholders, which it fully intends to do. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Company remains subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property as well as Federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.        The Company has certain subsidiaries that are taxed as regular corporations. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of non-REIT assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is established if based on the insight of available evidence; it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.                                         33   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Comparison of year ended December 31, 2005 to year ended December 31, 2004        For the year ended December 31, 2005, loss from operations decreased by $35.3 million from loss of $41.5 million in 2004 to a loss of $6.2 million in 2005. The decrease was due to decreased expenses of $58.2 million, including a reduction in debt extinguishment costs of $51.6 million, deferred financing costs related to the extinguished debt of $5.6 million, and Florida storm damage of $1.0 million, and increased revenues of $7.6 million offset by increased depreciation and other miscellaneous expenses of $29.7 million and an increase in equity loss from affiliate of $0.8 million as described in more detail below.        Income from rental property increased by $11.9 million from $167.1 million to $179.0 million, or 7.1 percent, due to property acquisitions, rent increases, and other community revenues.        Revenue from home sales increased by $0.7 million from $17.7 million to $18.4 million, or 4.0 percent. The decline in the number of homes sold was more than offset by increases in average sales prices.        Rental home revenue increased by $4.5 million from $4.6 million to $9.1 million, or 97.8 percent due primarily to an increase in the number of tenants in the Company's rental program. Additional information regarding the Company's rental program is contained in the table following these results of operations.        Interest income decreased by $2.2 million from $6.6 million to $4.4 million, or 33.3 percent, due primarily to a decrease in interest earning notes and receivables.        Other income decreased by $1.6 million from $0.9 million to $(0.7) million, due primarily to an increase in loss on disposal of assets of $0.9 million, an increase in expenses associated with failed acquisitions of $0.5 million and a decrease in other miscellaneous income of $0.2 million.        Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $3.6 million from $41.5 million to $45.1 million, or 8.7 percent. The increase was due to increases in utility costs ($1.6 million), payroll expense ($0.9 million), repair and maintenance expense ($0.5 million), biennial corporate conference expense ($0.2 million), and miscellaneous other expenses ($0.4 million).        Real estate taxes increased by $1.4 million from $13.8 million to $15.2 million, or 10.1 percent due to increases in assessments and tax rates.        Cost of home sales decreased by $0.3 million from $14.2 million to $13.9 million, or 2.1 percent due primarily to the decrease in the number of homes sold offset by an increase in the average cost of homes. Overall home sales gross margins increased $1.1 million from $3.4 million to $4.5 million, or 32.4 percent.        Rental home operating and maintenance increased by $4.0 million from $3.4 million to $7.4 million due primarily to an increase in the number of tenants in the Company's rental program.                                         34   Additional information regarding the Company's rental program is contained in the table following these results of operations.        General and administrative expenses for rental property increased by $1.9 million from $12.6 million to $14.5 million, due to an increase in salaries, benefits and consulting expense ($1.5 million) and legal costs primarily associated with the SEC inquiry ($1.2 million) offset by a reduction in training expense ($0.4 million) and Michigan Single Business tax ($0.4 million).        General and administrative expenses for home sales and rentals decreased by $1.9 million from $8.1 million to $6.2 million, or 23.5 percent, due to decreases in federal income tax expense ($0.9 million), advertising expense ($0.5 million) and salaries, benefits and consulting ($0.6 million) offset by an increase in other miscellaneous expenses ($0.1 million).        Depreciation and amortization increased by $9.1 million from $45.2 million to $54.3 million, or 20.1 percent, due primarily to a change in the estimated service lives of homes in the Company's rental program and an increase in the total rental home portfolio. The change in estimated useful lives was prospectively adopted during the first quarter of 2005.        Interest expense, including interest on mandatorily redeemable debt, increased by $11.8 million from $48.2 million to $60.0 million, or 24.5 percent, due to increased debt levels and higher interest rates on floating rate debt.        Debt extinguishment expense in 2004 of $51.6 million includes prepayment penalties, fees and other costs associated with extinguishing $345.0 million of unsecured notes. Deferred financing costs related to these notes and other debt repaid were expensed.  Comparison of year ended December 31, 2004 to year ended December 31, 2003        For the year ended December 31, 2004, income from operations decreased by $64.8 million from income of $23.3 million to a loss of $41.5 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was due to increased expenses of $16.0 million, debt extinguishment costs of $51.6 million, deferred financing costs related to the extinguished debt of $5.6 million, Florida storm damage of $0.6 million, and decreased equity income from affiliate of $0.8 million, offset by increased revenues of $9.8 million as described in more detail below.        Income from rental property increased by $8.6 million from $158.5 million to $167.1 million, or 5.4 percent, due to property acquisitions, rent increases, and other community revenues.        Revenue from home sales decreased by $1.8 million from $19.5 million to $17.7 million, or 9.2 percent. The decline is due primarily to a decrease in the number of homes sold.        Rental home revenue increased by $1.7 million from $2.9 million to $4.6 million, or 58.6 percent due primarily to an increase in the number of tenants in the Company's rental program. Additional information regarding the Company's rental program is contained in the table following these results of operations.                                         35         Interest income, including income from Origen, decreased by $4.8 million from $11.4 million to $6.6 million, or 42.1 percent, due primarily to a decrease in interest earning notes and receivables.        Other operating income increased by $0.2 million from $0.7 million to $0.9 million, due primarily to increase in brokerage commissions.        Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $1.9 million from $39.6 million to $41.5 million, or 4.8 percent. The increase was due to increases in utility costs ($0.7 million), payroll expense ($0.5 million), repair and maintenance expense ($0.2 million), insurance expense ($0.3 million), and miscellaneous other expenses ($0.2 million).        Real estate taxes increased by $2.1 million from $11.7 million to $13.8 million, or 17.9 percent due to acquisitions made in 2004 ($0.7 million) and increases in assessments and tax rates ($1.4 million).        Cost of home sales increased by $0.3 million from $13.9 million to $14.2 million, or 2.1 percent due primarily to the decrease in the number of homes sold offset by an increase in the average cost of homes. Overall home sales gross margins decreased $2.2 million from $5.6 million to $3.4 million, or 39.3 percent.        Rental home operating and maintenance increased by $1.8 million from $1.6 million to $3.4 million due primarily to an increase in the number of tenants in the Company's rental program. Additional information regarding the Company's rental program is contained in the table following these results of operations.        General and administrative expenses for rental property increased by $2.1 million from $10.5 million to $12.6 million, due to compensation expenses ($0.7 million), Michigan Single Business tax ($0.3 million), system conversion costs ($0.4 million), Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance costs ($0.3 million), and miscellaneous other expenses ($0.4 million).        General and administrative expenses for home sales and rentals increased by $2.1 million from $6.0 million to $8.1 million, or 35.0 percent, due to increases in federal income tax expense ($0.7 million), salaries, benefits and consulting ($0.7 million), inventory utility costs ($0.2 million) and other miscellaneous expenses ($0.5 million).        Depreciation and amortization increased by $1.3 million from $43.9 million to $45.2 million, or 3.0 percent, due primarily to additional investment in rental property.        Debt extinguishment expense of $51.6 million includes prepayment penalties, fees and other costs associated with extinguishing $345.0 million of unsecured notes. Deferred financing costs of $5.6 million related to these notes and other debt repaid were expensed.        Interest expense, including interest on mandatorily redeemable debt increased by $9.5 million from $38.7 million to $48.2 million, or 24.5 percent, due to increased debt levels somewhat offset by lower interest rates and the reclassification of dividends paid on Preferred Operating Partnership Units ("POP Units") as interest expense pursuant to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liability and Equity" ("SFAS150").        The $4.9 million impairment charge recorded in 2003 relates to a reduction in book value of a new community development due to the impracticality of future phase development.                                         36   SAME PROPERTY INFORMATION        The following table reflects property-level financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The "Same Property" data represents information regarding the operation of communities owned as of January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005. Site, occupancy, and rent data for those communities is presented as of the last day of each period presented. The "Total Portfolio" column differentiates from the "Same Property" column by including financial information for properties acquired after January 1, 2004 and new development communities.

NOI is       derived from revenues (determined in accordance with GAAP) minus property       operating expenses and real estate taxes (determined in accordance with       GAAP). NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in       accordance with GAAP and should not be considered to be an alternative to       net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the       Company's financial performance or to be an alternative to cash flow from       operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of       the Company's liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for the       Company's cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions.       The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP       measurement to net operating income. Net income includes interest and       depreciation and amortization which often have no effect on the market       value of a property and therefore limit its use as a performance measure.       In addition, such expenses are often incurred at a parent company level       and therefore are not necessarily linked to the performance of a real       estate asset. The Company believes that net operating income is helpful to       investors as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator       of the return on property investment, and provides a method of comparing       property performance over time. The Company uses NOI as a key management       tool when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties       and/or groups of properties. The principal limitation of NOI is that it       excludes depreciation, amortization and non-property specific expenses       such as general and administrative expenses, all of which are significant       costs, and therefore, NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the       properties of the Company rather than of the Company overall.  (2)   Occupied sites include manufactured housing and permanent recreational       vehicle sites, and exclude seasonal recreational vehicle sites.  (3)   Occupancy % and weighted average rent relates to manufactured housing       sites, excluding both permanent and seasonal recreational vehicle sites.                                         37         On a same property basis, property net operating income increased by $4.0 million from $109.9 million to $113.9 million, or 3.6 percent. Income from property increased by $4.9 million from $154.0 million to $158.9 million, or 3.2 percent, due primarily to increases in rents including water and property tax pass through.        Property operating expenses increased by $.9 million from $44.1 million to $45.0 million, or 2.1 percent, due to increases in real estate taxes ($.6 million), payroll ($.2 million), utilities and other ($0.2 million).  RENTAL PROGRAM        The following table reflects additional information regarding the Company's rental program for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:                                                                                   YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                                                   ---------------------------------------------                                                                     2005               2004              2003                                                                   ---------          --------          --------                                                                           (in thousands except for *)        Rental home revenue                                               $   9,084          $  4,558          $  2,881 Site rent included in Income from rental property                    12,277             6,300             3,376                                                                   ---------          --------          --------            Rental program revenue                                    21,361            10,858             6,257 Expenses    Payroll and commissions                                            1,826             1,052               577    Repairs and refurbishment                                          3,190             1,375               526    Taxes and insurance                                                1,022               458               248    Other                                                              1,334               483               269                                                                   ---------          --------          --------            Rental program operating and maintenance                   7,372             3,368             1,620                                                                   ---------          --------          -------- Net operating income (1)                                          $  13,989          $  7,490          $  4,637                                                                   =========          ========          ========  Number of occupied rentals, end of period*                            3,711             1,933             1,171 Cost of occupied rental homes                                     $ 109,214          $ 51,540          $ 29,261 Weighted average monthly rental rate*                             $     643          $    579          $    540   (1) See Note(1) following Same Property Information on page 37.        Net operating income from the rental program increased $6.5 million from $7.5 million in 2004 to $14.0 million in 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in revenue offset by a $4.0 million increase in expenses. Revenues increased due to an increase in the weighted average monthly rental rate and an increase in the number of leased rental homes. Expenses were also impacted by the increase in the number of leased rental homes. A comparison of the year ended 2003 to the year ended 2004 would show similar increases in net operating income, revenue and expenses for the same reasons as noted in the comparison of the year ended 2005 to the year ended 2004.                                         38   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES        The Company's principal liquidity demands have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, distributions to the Company's stockholders and the unitholders of the Operating Partnership, capital improvements of properties, the purchase of new and pre-owned homes, property acquisitions, development and expansion of properties, and debt repayment.        The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through its working capital provided by operating activities, through its $115.0 million line of credit and through such other lines of credit that may be entered into. The Company considers these resources to be adequate to meet all operating requirements, including recurring capital improvements, routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature, pay dividends to its stockholders to maintain qualification as a REIT in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and make distributions to the Operating Partnership's unitholders.        The Company plans to invest approximately $2 to $5 million in developments consisting of expansions to existing communities and the development of new communities during 2006. The Company expects to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit.        The Company has invested $7.3 million in the acquisition of properties during 2005. The Company continuously seeks acquisition opportunities that meet the Company's criteria for acquisition. Should such investment opportunities arise in 2006, the Company will finance the acquisitions though the temporary use of its line of credit until permanent secured financing can be arranged, through the assumption of existing debt on the properties or the issuance of certain equity securities.        During 2005, the Company acquired a recreational vehicle community comprised of approximately 700 recreational vehicle sites and 30 manufactured housing sites in Dover, Florida for $7.3 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the Company purchased a manufactured housing community containing 227 sites in Oakland County, Michigan for $7.8 million and assumed $4.5 million of debt. The occupancy of this community is approximately 95.0 percent.        Also during 2005, the Company sold two properties located in Florida comprised of 96 manufactured housing sites and 165 recreational vehicle sites for a combined sales price of $5.7 million.        The Company has also invested approximately $66 million in the acquisition of homes primarily intended for its rental program. Expenditures for 2006 will be dependent upon the condition of the markets for repossessions and new home sales as well as rental homes.        Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $46.7 million to $5.9 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $52.6 million at December 31, 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $6.1 million to $66.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.        The Company's net cash flows provided by operating activities may be adversely impacted by, among other things: (a) the market and economic conditions in the Company's markets; (b) lower occupancy rates of the Properties; (c) increased operating costs, including insurance                                         39   premiums, real estate taxes and utilities, that cannot be passed on to the Company's tenants; and (d) decreased sales or rentals of manufactured homes. See "Risk Factors."        The Company has an unsecured line of credit facility with a maximum borrowing amount of $115 million, subject to certain borrowing base calculations, which bears interest at LIBOR + 1.75% and matures in September 2007, with a one-year optional extension. At December 31, 2005, $3.4 million of availability was used to back standby letters of credit and $36.5 million was available to be drawn under the facility based on the December 31, 2005 calculation of borrowing base. The line of credit facility contains various leverage, debt service coverage, net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2005.        The Company's primary long-term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness. At December 31, 2005, the Company's outstanding contractual obligations were as follows:                                                                               PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD                                                                                  (IN THOUSANDS)                                                           ------------------------------------------------------------ CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS              TOTAL DUE        1 YEAR        2-3 YEARS       4-5 YEARS       AFTER 5 YEARS                                          -----------      ---------      ---------       ---------       -------------            Collateralized term loan                 $    40,079      $     807      $  39,272       $      -          $       - Collateralized term loan - FNMA              387,624          2,417          7,618          8,418            369,171 Collateralized term loan - B of A            494,511          1,803         14,791         16,928            460,989 Mortgage notes, other                         65,831         23,999         25,329         12,233              4,271 Line of credit                                73,300                        73,300              -                  - Redeemable Preferred OP Units                 62,123          8,175          4,500          8,940             40,507 Operating leases                               1,948            885          1,063              -                  -                                          -----------      ---------      ---------       ---------       -------------                                          $ 1,125,416      $  38,086      $ 165,873       $ 46,519          $ 874,938                                          -----------      ---------      ---------       ---------       -------------         Interest expense is a material cash requirement of the Company and is expected to be in excess of $63.0 million during 2006.        The Company anticipates meeting its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled debt maturities, large property acquisitions, and Operating Partnership unit redemptions through the collateralization of a significant portion of its Properties. From time to time, the Company may also issue shares of its capital stock, issue equity units in the Operating Partnership or sell selected assets. The ability of the Company to finance its long-term liquidity requirements in such manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time, including the availability and cost of mortgage debt, the financial condition of the Company, the operating history of the Properties, the state of the debt and equity markets, and the general national, regional and local economic conditions. See "Risk Factors". If the Company is unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted.        At December 31, 2005, the Company's debt to total capitalization approximated 63.8 percent (assuming conversion of all Common OP Units to shares of common stock). The debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately 7.8 years and a weighted average interest rate of 5.3 percent.                                         40         Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 included recurring capital expenditures of $7.7 million and $6.6 million (excluding $0.4 million related to a software conversion), respectively.        Net cash used in investing activities was $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $154.4 million in the prior year. The difference is due to: decreased investment in rental properties of $60.0 million; decreased purchase of short-term investments of $90.0 million; offset by decreased proceeds from property and land disposition of $4.4 million; decreased repayments of notes receivables and officer's notes, net of $14.9 million; and decreased proceeds from loans sold to Origen of $13.3 million.        Net cash used in financing activities was $75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $122.9 million in the prior year. The difference is primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from notes payable and other debt of $174.3 million, inclusive of borrowings on the line of credit $172.3 million, the retirement of $50.0 million of Perpetual Preferred Operating Partnership Units and a reduction in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and OP units, net of $3.3 million, offset by decreased distributions of $2.6 million, decreased treasury stock purchases of $17.2 million, and decreased payments of deferred financing costs of $9.0 million.  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES        The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was less than 1:1 (the earnings deficiency required to bring the ratio to 1:1 was $6.3 million and $46.1 million, respectively). The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.29:1 for the year ended December 31, 2003.  INFLATION        Most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease expires. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.                                         41   SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT        This Form 10-K contains various "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Company intends that such forward-looking statements will be subject to the safe harbors created thereby.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3" ("SFAS No. 154"). SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted. SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.        In December 2004, the FASB issued Share-Based Payment Statement No. 123(R), that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Under the FASB's statement, all forms of share-based payments to employees, including employee stock options, must be treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the income statement. The expense of the award would generally be measured at fair value at the grant date. Current accounting guidance requires that the expense relating to so-called fixed plan employee stock options only be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. The Statement eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees for options granted after June 15, 2005. On April 14, 2005, the SEC announced it would permit companies to implement statement 123(R) at the beginning of their next fiscal year. The Company plans to adopt the new rules reflected in statement 123(R) using the modified-prospective method, effective January 1, 2006. The Company believes that the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations.                                         42   OTHER        Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is a useful supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not readily apparent from net income. Management believes that the use of FFO has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful.        Because FFO excludes significant economic components of net income including depreciation and amortization, FFO should be used as an adjunct to net income and not as an alternative to net income. The principal limitation of FFO is that it does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, FFO is not intended as a measure of a REIT's ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements, nor as a measure of working capital. FFO only provides investors with an additional performance measure. Other REITS may use different methods for calculating FFO and, accordingly, the Company's FFO may not be comparable to other REITs.

The valuation adjustment reflects the theoretical noncash       profit and loss were those hedging transactions terminated at the balance       sheet date. As the Company has no expectation of terminating the       transactions prior to maturity, the net of these noncash valuation       adjustments will be zero at the various maturities. As any imperfection       related to hedging correlation in these swaps is reflected currently in       cash as interest, the valuation adjustments reflect volatility that would       distort the comparative measurement of FFO and on a net basis approximate       zero. Accordingly, the valuation adjustments are excluded from FFO. The       valuation adjustment is included in interest expense.  (2)  The Company acquired the equity interest of another investor in SunChamp in       December 2002. Consideration consisted of a long-term note payable at net       book value. Although the adjustment for the allocation of the SunChamp       losses (based on SunChamp as a stand-alone entity) is not reflected in the       accompanying financial statements, management believes that it is       appropriate to provide for this adjustment because the Company's payment       obligations with respect to the note are subordinate in all respects to       the return of the members' equity (including the gross book value of the       acquired equity) plus a preferred return. As a result, the losses that are       allocated to the Company from SunChamp as a stand-alone entity under       generally accepted accounting principles are effectively reallocated to       the note for purposes of calculating FFO. A situation such as this is not       contemplated in the NAREIT definition of FFO due to the unique       circumstances of the transaction. Although not comparable to the precise       NAREIT definition, the Company believes the inclusion of this item in its       calculation of FFO to be appropriate as noted above.                                         44       ITEM  7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK        The Company's principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company mitigates this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage, minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures, which include the periodic use of derivatives. The Company's primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that changes in interest rates could have on its future cash flows. The Company generally employs derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.        The Company has entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement. One of the swap agreements fixes $25 million of variable rate borrowings at 4.84 percent for the period April 2003 through July 2009, another of the swap agreements fixes $25 million of variable rate borrowings at 5.28 percent for the period April 2003 through July 2012 and the third swap agreement, which is only effective for so long as 90-day LIBOR is 7 percent or less, fixes $25 million of variable rate borrowings at 3.88 percent for the period April 2003 through July 2007. The interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of 9.49 percent, a notional amount of $152.4 million and a termination date of April 13, 2006. Each of the Company's derivative contracts is based upon 90-day LIBOR.        The Company's remaining variable rate debt totals $166.7 million as of December 31, 2005 which bears interest at Prime, various LIBOR or Fannie Mae Discounted Mortgage Backed Securities ("DMBS") rates. If Prime, LIBOR, or DMBS increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company believes its interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, based on the $131.2 million and $169.7 million average balance outstanding under the Company's variable rate debt facilities for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.        Additionally, the Company had $13.5 million and $14.7 million LIBOR based variable rate mortgage and other notes receivable as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. If LIBOR increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company believes interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, based on the $14.1 million and $19.3 million average balance outstanding on all variable rate notes receivable for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
