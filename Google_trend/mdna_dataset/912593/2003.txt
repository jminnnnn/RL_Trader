ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW           The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein.           The Company is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT which owns, operates, develops and finances manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern United States. As of December 31, 2002, the Company owned and operated a portfolio of 129 developed properties located in seventeen states, including 117 manufactured housing communities, five recreational vehicle communities, and seven properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites.           During 2002, the Company acquired four manufactured housing communities, comprising 1,482 developed sites and 538 sites suitable for development for $69.9 million, and the Company sold one manufactured housing community for $3.3 million.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES           Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements. Nevertheless, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.           Management believes the following significant accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:           Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Rental property is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Management evaluates the recoverability of its investment in rental property whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as recent operating results, expected net operating cash flow and plans for future operations, indicate that full asset recoverability is questionable. If such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement, the impairment that would be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined on a discounted net cash flow basis.            Notes Receivable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its notes receivable (including the notes receivable from Origen) whenever events occur or there are changes in                                         -30-   circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The loan is then measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flow discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.           Depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company uses a thirty year useful life for land improvements and buildings and a seven to fifteen year useful life for furniture, fixtures and equipment.           Revenue Recognition. Rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight-line basis when earned from tenants. Leases entered into by tenants generally range from month-to-month to one year and are renewable by mutual agreement of the Company and the resident.           Capitalized Costs. The Company capitalizes certain costs (including interest and other costs) incurred in connection with the development, redevelopment, capital enhancement and leasing of its properties. Management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization. The amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities. Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred. Renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete. Certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period; shorter than the average resident's occupancy in the home and the average term that the home is in our community. Costs associated with implementing the Company's new computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware.           Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. During 2002, the Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements to offset interest rate risk. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. The Company adjusts its balance sheet on an ongoing quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of its derivatives. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income, as appropriate. The ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged. The unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings over time and occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings. The Company uses standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments, including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized.           Deferred Tax Assets. SHS currently has significant deferred tax assets, which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments. SHS has recognized deferred tax assets of $2.4 million, net of a valuation reserve of $5.1 million. Realization of these deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon SHS's achievement of projected future taxable income. Judgments regarding future profitability may change due to                                         -31-   future market conditions, SHS's ability to continue to successfully execute its business plan and other factors.            Income Taxes. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT as defined under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the Company's gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes at least ninety percent (90%) of its REIT ordinary taxable income to its stockholders, which it fully intends to do. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Company remains subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property as well as Federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Comparison of year ended December 31, 2002 to year ended December 31, 2001           For the year ended December 31, 2002, income before equity income (loss) from affiliates, minority interests, discontinued operations, and gain from property dispositions, net, decreased by $3.2 million from $42.9 million to $39.7 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease was due to increased expenses of $12.4 million while revenues increased by $9.2 million.           Income from property increased by $12.9 million from $138.7 million to $151.6 million, or 9.3 percent, due to rent increases and other community revenues ($5.9 million) and acquisitions ($7.0 million).           Other income decreased by $3.7 million from $14.4 million to $10.7 million due primarily to a decrease in interest income ($2.3 million) and reduced development fee income and other income ($1.4 million).           Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $4.4 million from $29.0 million to $33.4 million, or 15.2 percent, due to acquired communities ($1.9 million) and increases in costs including payroll ($1.2 million), workers' compensation ($0.5 million), and cable television ($0.3 million), and other expenses ($0.5 million).           Real estate taxes increased by $1.0 million from $9.5 million to $10.5 million, due to the acquired communities ($0.5 million) and changes in certain assessments.           Property management expenses decreased by $0.2 million from $2.7 million to $2.5 million, representing 1.7 percent and 2.0 percent of income from property in 2002 and 2001, respectively.                                             -32-            General and administrative expenses increased by $0.6 million from $4.6 million to $5.2 million, representing 3.2 percent and 3.0 percent of total revenues in 2002 and 2001, respectively.           Interest expense increased by $1.4 million from $31.0 million to $32.4 million due primarily to financing additional investments in rental property ($6.0 million) offset by decreasing rates on variable rate debt ($4.9 million).           Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $5.2 million from $33.3 million to $38.5 million due primarily to the net additional investments in rental properties.           Equity income (loss) from affiliates decreased by $16.7 million from income of $0.1 million to a loss of $16.6 million primarily due to equity losses at SHS ($0.7 million), SunChamp ($0.4 million) and Origen ($1.7 million) and the write-off of the Company's investment in Origen ($13.6 million) and a technology investment ($0.3 million).  Comparison of year ended December 31, 2001 to year ended December 31, 2000           For the year ended December 31, 2001, income before equity income (loss) from affiliates, minority interests, discontinued operations, and gain from property dispositions, net, increased by $1.9 million from $41.0 million to $42.9 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was due to increased revenues of $7.4 million while expenses increased by $5.5 million.           Income from property increased by $6.6 million from $132.1 million to $138.7 million, or 5.0 percent, due to rent increases and other community revenues ($6.5 million) and acquisitions ($4.4 million), offset by a revenue reduction of $4.3 million due to property dispositions.           Other income increased by $0.9 million from $13.5 million to $14.4 million due primarily to an increase in interest income ($1.3 million) offset by reductions in other income ($0.4 million).           Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $0.6 million from $28.4 million to $29.0 million, or 2.0 percent, representing general cost increases ($1.0 million) and acquisitions ($0.7 million), offset by an expense reduction of $1.1 million due to property dispositions.           Real estate taxes increased by $0.4 million from $9.1 million to $9.5 million, or 4.5 percent, due to the acquired communities ($0.2 million) and changes in certain assessments.           Property management expenses decreased by $0.2 million from $2.9 million to $2.7 million, representing 2.0 percent and 2.2 percent of income from property in 2001 and 2000, respectively.           General and administrative expenses increased by $0.5 million from $4.1 million to $4.6 million, representing 3.0 percent and 2.8 percent of total revenues in 2001 and 2000, respectively.                                          -33-            Interest expense increased by $1.4 million from $29.6 million to $31.0 million due primarily to financing additional investments in rental property offset by decreasing rates on variable rate debt.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.8 million from $30.5 million to $33.3 million due primarily to the net additional investments in rental properties.  Equity in income (loss) of affiliates decreased by $0.5 million due primarily to a reduced level of new home sales at Sun Homes Services.  SAME PROPERTY INFORMATION           The following table reflects property-level financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The "Same Property" data represents information regarding the operation of communities owned as of January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2002. Site, occupancy, and rent data for those communities is presented as of the last day of each period presented. The "Total Portfolio" column differentiates from the "Same Property" column by including financial information for properties acquired after January 1, 2001 and new development communities.

(2)  Property site information includes eleven SunChamp communities acquired      during the fourth quarter of 2002.  On a same property basis, property revenues increased by $5.8 million from $123.2 million to $129.0 million, or 4.7 percent, due primarily to increases in rents and related charges including water and property tax pass through.  Property operating expenses increased by $1.5 million from $32.4 million to $33.9 million, or 4.7 percent, due to increased costs. Property net operating income increased by $4.2 million from $90.8 million to $95.0 million, or 4.7 percent.                                          -34-   The occupancy at December 31, 2002, includes 19 new community developments with 3,552 sites which are 64.8 percent occupied. At December 31, 2001, there were five new community developments with 564 sites, which were 45.2 percent occupied. Excluding new community developments, occupancy was 92.4 percent and 93.8 percent at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           The Company's principal liquidity demands have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, distributions to the Company's stockholders and the Operating Partnership's unitholders, property acquisitions, development and expansion of properties, capital improvements of properties and debt repayment.           The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through its working capital provided by operating activities and its line of credit, as described below. The Company considers its ability to generate cash from operations (anticipated to be approximately $70 million) to be adequate to meet all operating requirements, including recurring capital improvements, routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature, pay dividends to its stockholders to maintain qualification as a REIT in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and make distributions to the Operating Partnership's unitholders.           The Company plans to invest approximately $5 to $10 million in developments consisting of expansions to existing communities and the new or continuing development of new communities. The Company expects to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit.           Furthermore, the Company expects to invest in the range of $40 to $60 million in the acquisition of properties in 2003, depending upon market conditions. The Company plans to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit.           Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1.9 million to $2.7 million at December 31, 2002 compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2001 because cash used in investing activities exceeded cash provided by financing and operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $14.9 million to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $65.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from reduced net income after adding back the reduction in book value of investments and an increase in other assets.           The Company's net cash flows provided by operating activities may be adversely impacted by, among other things: (a) the market and economic conditions in the Company's current markets generally, and specifically in metropolitan areas of the Company's current markets; (b) lower occupancy and rental rates of the Properties; (c) increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, real estate taxes and utilities, that cannot be passed on to the Company's tenants; and (d) decreased sales of manufactured homes. See "Factors that May Affect Future Results."                                          -35-            In 2002, the Company closed on a $152.4 million collateralized five year variable rate (2.17% at December 31, 2002) debt facility with an option to extend an additional five years at a variable rate debt facility, which is convertible to a five to ten year fixed rate loan but not to exceed a total term of fifteen years.           In July 2002, the Company refinanced its existing line of credit to an $85 million unsecured line of credit facility, which matures in July 2005, with a one-year optional extension. At December 31, 2002, the average interest rate of outstanding borrowings under the line of credit was 2.27%, $63 million was outstanding and $22 million was available to be drawn under the facility. Subsequent to year end, the Company increased the line to $105 million. The line of credit facility contains various leverage, debt service coverage, net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2002.           In 1998, certain directors, employees and consultants of the Company purchased newly issued shares of common stock of the Company and common OP Units in the Operating Partnership for approximately $25.5 million in accordance with the Sun Communities 1998 Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan"). The participants in the Purchase Plan financed these purchases through personal loans (the "Loans") from Bank One, N.A. (the "Bank") due in January 2004. The Company guaranteed the repayment of the Loans. The participants have agreed to fully indemnify the Company against any and all liabilities arising under such guaranty (the "Guaranty") (the principal balance of which was approximately $22.7 million at December 31, 2002).           Among other usual commercial provisions, the Guaranty requires that the Company comply with certain financial covenants. These covenants were initially designed to be identical in all material respects with the financial covenants imposed on the Company under its line of credit facility. Since 1998, as the covenants in the Company's then applicable line of credit facility changed, the Guaranty has also been similarly amended to remain consistent. In July 2002, the Company entered into a replacement line of credit facility; however, conforming amendments to the Guaranty were not made, resulting in differing and inconsistent financial covenants in the line of credit facility as compared to the Guaranty. As a consequence, as of September 30, 2002, the Company was not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants contained in the Guaranty (the "Differing Financial Covenants"). Because it was not the intention of the parties to impose disparate requirements on the Guaranty and the Company's line of credit, the Bank waived any breach of the Guaranty arising solely as a result of the Company's non-compliance with the Differing Financial Covenants so long as the Company remains in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of its line of credit facility. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with the terms and conditions of its line of credit facility and, as a result, the Company was in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Guaranty.           Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") states that it is "unlawful for any issuer . . . directly or indirectly, including through any subsidiary, to extend or maintain credit, to arrange for the extension of credit, or to renew an extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer (or equivalent thereof) of that                                         -36-   issuer." Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides an exception for certain extensions of credit which are "maintained by the issuer on the date of enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act [July 30, 2002] . . ., provided that there is no material modification to any term of any such extension of credit or any renewal of any such extension of credit on or after that date of enactment." Jaffe, Raitt, Heuer & Weiss, P.C. has delivered a reasoned opinion to the Company to the effect that, based on various assumptions and qualifications set forth in the opinion, a court could reasonably find that Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act does not apply to the waiver letter issued by the Bank and that, even if a court determines that Section 402 applies to the Bank's waiver letter, a court could reasonably conclude that the Guaranty fits within the exception under Section 402 for extensions of credit maintained by the issuer prior to July 30, 2002. Arthur A. Weiss, a stockholder of Jaffe, Raitt, Heuer & Weiss, P.C., the Company's regular outside counsel, is a director of the Company and received a personal loan to purchase common OP Units under the Purchase Plan.           There is no case law directly on point, and we cannot assure you that a court would not decide differently from the views expressed in counsel's opinion and such opinion represents only the best judgment of counsel and is not binding in the courts. It is unclear what the consequences to the Company would be if a court determined the Bank's waiver letter constituted a material modification of the terms of the Guaranty in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.           The Company's primary long-term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness. At December 31, 2002, the Company's outstanding contractual obligations were as follows:                                                                                    PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD                                                                                     (IN THOUSANDS)                                                                -------------------------------------------------------  CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS(1)               TOTAL DUE         1 YEAR     2-3 YEARS       4-5 YEARS     AFTER 5 YEARS                                               ---------         ------     ---------       ---------     -------------            Bridge Loan                                    $ 48,000        $ 48,000 Line of credit                                   63,000                                     $ 63,000 Collateralized term loan                         42,206             658     $  1,463          40,085 Collateralized term loan - FNMA                 152,363                                                      $152,363 Senior notes(2)                                 285,000          85,000       65,000          35,000          100,000 Mortgage notes, other                            60,366           1,046       24,096          13,814           21,410 Capitalized lease obligations                    16,438           6,832        9,606 Redeemable Preferred OP Units                    53,978           1,000        2,564          14,632           35,782                                                --------        --------     --------        --------         --------                                                $721,351        $142,536     $102,729        $166,531         $309,555                                                ========        ========     ========        ========         ========   (1)      As noted above, the Company is the guarantor of $22.7 million in          personal bank loans, maturing in 2004, made to the Company's directors,          employees and consultants for the purpose of purchasing shares of          Company common stock or Operating Partnership OP Units pursuant to the          Company's Stock Purchase Plan. The Company is obligated under the          Guaranty only in the event that one or more of the borrowers cannot          repay their loan when due. This contingent liability is not reflected          on the Company's balance sheet.  (2)      The provisions of the callable/redeemable $65 million notes are such          that the maturity date will likely be 2005 if the 10-year treasury rate          is greater than 5.7% on May 16, 2005. The maturity is reflected in the          above table based on that assumption.                                          -37-           The Company anticipates meeting its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled debt maturities, large property acquisitions and Operating Partnership unit redemptions, through the issuance of debt or equity securities, including equity units in the Operating Partnership, or from selective asset sales. As discussed above, the Company is also obligated to loan Origen up to $35.5 million under the Origen credit facility, of which $1.9 million remained to be drawn as of December 31, 2002. The Company has maintained investment grade ratings with Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's, which facilitates access to the senior unsecured debt market. Since 1993, the Company has raised, in the aggregate, nearly $1 billion from the sale of shares of its common stock, the sale of OP units in the Operating Partnership, and the issuance of secured and unsecured debt securities. In addition, at December 31, 2002, 92 of the Properties were unencumbered by debt, therefore, providing substantial financial flexibility. The ability of the Company to finance its long-term liquidity requirements in such manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time, including the availability and cost of mortgage debt, the financial condition of the Company, the operating history of the Properties, the state of the debt and equity markets, and the general national, regional and local economic conditions. See "Factors that May Affect Future Results". If the Company is unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing on acceptable terms, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed.           The Company's $48.0 million bridge loan and $85.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes are due April 30 and May 1, 2003, respectively. The Company expects to repay this indebtedness by issuing additional senior unsecured debt securities. The ability of the Company to issue such additional debt securities will be affected primarily by the state of the senior unsecured debt market and general, national and international economic and political conditions, such as the uncertainty associated with the current war in Iraq. If the Company is unable to access the senior unsecured debt market, or is unable to otherwise refinance these notes, on terms acceptable to the Company prior to May 1, 2003 and the Company is unable to successfully negotiate extensions with the holders of these debt obligations, the Company would seek secured financing on some of its 92 unencumbered properties.           Included in minority interests are $36 million of Preferred OP Units which would require collateralization were the Company to no longer be classified as investment grade by the rating agencies.           At December 31, 2002, the Company's debt to total market capitalization approximated 43.6 percent (assuming conversion of all Common OP Units to shares of common stock). The debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.6 years and a weighted average interest rate of 5.3 percent.           Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 included recurring capital expenditures of $7.1 million and $4.8 million, respectively.           Net cash used in investing activities was $168.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $34.8 million in the prior year. The differences are due to: increased investment in rental properties of $17.0 million; decreased proceeds from property disposition of $14 million; and increased investment in notes receivables and investment in and advances to affiliates of $103.1 million. Additionally, the Company acquired $10.0 million in rental properties through the issuance of Preferred OP Units.                                           -38-            Net cash provided by financing activities was $116.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to a use of net cash in the prior year of $44.9 million. The differences are due to: changes in net proceeds from notes payable, inclusive of line of credit repayments, of $144.5 million; changes in net proceeds from common stock issuance of $19.2 million; and increased distributions of $2.8 million.  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES           The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 was 1.68:1, 1.73:1 and 1.74:1 respectively.  INFLATION           Most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease expires. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.  SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT           This Form 10-K contains various "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. The words "may", "will", "expect", "believe", "anticipate", "should", "estimate", and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance, but are based upon current assumptions regarding the Company's operations, future results and prospects, and are subject to many uncertainties and factors relating to the Company's operations and business environment which may cause the actual results of the Company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Please see "Factors That May Affect Future Results" for a representative example of such uncertainties and factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS           In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN No. 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." The objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity ("VIE") and determine when the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of operations of a VIE need to be included in a company's consolidated financial statements. A company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company's interest in the VIE is such that the company will absorb a majority of the VIE"s expected losses and/or receive a majority of the VIE's expected residual returns, if they occur. FIN No. 46 also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders. The provisions of this interpretation became effective upon issuance with respect to VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and to VIEs in which a company obtains an interest after that date. The provisions of this interpretation apply in the first interim period                                         -39-   beginning after June 15, 2003 (i.e., third quarter of 2003) to VIEs in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company is in the process of assessing whether it has an interest in any VIEs which may require consolidation in the third quarter of 2003 pursuant to FIN No. 46. Entities that may be identified as VIEs include SHS and Origen.           In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure," which provides guidance on how to transition from the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation under APB 25 to SFAS 123's fair value method of accounting, if a company so elects. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.           In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN 45) No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 clarifies disclosures that are required to be made for certain guarantees and establishes a requirement to record a liability at fair value for certain guarantees at the time of the guarantee's issuance. The disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 have been applied in these financial statements. The requirement to record a liability applies to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the requirements of FIN 45 to have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.           In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." The statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the statement include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing or other exit or disposal activity. The statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.           In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 145, "Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of SFAS 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002." The provisions of this statement related to the rescission of Statement 4 shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The provisions related to Statement 13 shall be effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002, with early application encouraged. All provisions of this Statement shall be effective for financial statements issued on or after May 15, 2002, with early application encouraged. Adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.           In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." This Statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment of a                                         -40-   business (as previously defined in that Opinion). The provisions of this SFAS 144 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application encouraged. The provisions of this standard are generally to be applied prospectively. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold Kings Pointe Mobile Home Park, located in Winter Haven, Florida, for approximately $3.4 million. In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company's consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flow have been revised from those originally reported for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 to separately reflect the results of discontinued operations for one property that was sold in the first quarter of 2002. These results were previously included in income from operations. These revisions had no impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheets or statements of stockholders' equity and these revisions had no impact on net income or net income per share of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.           In June 2001, the FASB approved SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS 141 requires, among other things, that the purchase method of accounting for business combinations be used for all business combinations initiated after September 30, 2001. SFAS 142 addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS 142 requires, among other things, that goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets no longer be amortized and that such assets be tested for impairment at least annually. The adoption of these standards did not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.  OTHER           Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as "net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus rental property depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures." Industry analysts consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating performance of an equity REIT primarily because the computation of FFO excludes historical cost depreciation as an expense and thereby facilitates the comparison of REITs which have different cost bases in their assets. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, whereas real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen based upon market conditions. FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, FFO is not intended as a measure of a REIT's ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements, nor as a measure of working capital. The following table reconciles net income to FFO and calculates FFO data for both basic and diluted purposes for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (in thousands):                                          -41-                                 SUN COMMUNITIES, INC.

The valuation adjustment reflects the      theoretical noncash profit and loss were those swaps terminated at the      balance sheet date. As the Company has no expectation of terminating the      swaps prior to maturity, the net of these noncash valuation adjustments      will be zero at the various maturities. As any imperfections related to      hedging correlation in these swaps is reflected currently in cash as      interest, the valuation adjustments are excluded from Funds From      Operations. The valuation adjustment is included in interest expense.  (2)  The Company acquired the equity interest of another investor in SunChamp in      December 2002. Consideration consisted of a long-term note payable at net      book value. The note is subordinated to the return of gross book value of      equity and cumulative preferred returns of 9.25% on the Company's      investment and the acquired investment. In substance, this note is a      cumulative "first-loss" position relative to the Company's interest.      Accordingly, the losses formerly allocated or allocable to the Company are      reallocated to the note.                                          -42-   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK           The Company's principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company mitigates this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage, minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures, which include the periodic use of derivatives. The Company's primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that changes in interest rates could have on its future cash flows. The Company generally employs derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.           The Company's variable rate debt totals $285.4 million as of December 31, 2002 which bears interest at various LIBOR or FNMA Discounted Mortgage Backed Securities ("DMBS") rates. If LIBOR or DMBS increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company believes its interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, based on the $171.3 million and $68.3 million average balance outstanding under the Company's variable rate debt facilities for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.           Additionally, the Company had $27.3 million and $49.0 million LIBOR based variable rate mortgage and other notes receivables as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. If LIBOR increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company believes interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.37 million and $0.8 million, respectively, based on the $36.7 million and $79.5 million average balance outstanding on all variable rate notes receivables for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
