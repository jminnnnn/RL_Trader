ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL             CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW        The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein.        The Company is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT which owns, operates and finances manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern United States. As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned and operated or financed a portfolio of 116 developed properties located in 15 states, including 104 manufactured housing communities, 5 recreational vehicle communities, and 7 properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites.        During 2001, the Company acquired five manufactured housing communities, comprising 2,332 developed sites, for $55.8 million and two development communities, comprising 1,273 sites, for $4.3 million and the Company sold two manufactured housing communities for $16.2 million.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements. Nevertheless, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.        Management believes the following significant accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:        Principles of Consolidation. The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries, including Sun Communities Operating Limited Partnership.        Notes Receivable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its notes receivable whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The loan is then measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flow discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.                                          23        Rental Property. Rental property is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Management evaluates the recoverability of its investment in rental property whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as recent operating results, expected net operating cash flow and plans for future operations, indicate that full asset recoverability is questionable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of such assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement, the impairment that would be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined on a discounted net cash flow basis.        Revenue Recognition. Rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight-line basis when earned from tenants. Leases entered into by tenants generally range from month-to-month to one year and are renewable by mutual agreement of the Company and the resident.        Income Taxes. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT as defined under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the Company's gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes at least ninety percent (90%) of its REIT ordinary taxable income to its stockholders, which it fully intends to do.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Comparison of year ended December 31, 2001 to year ended December 31, 2000        For the year ended December 31, 2001, income before gain from property dispositions, net and minority interests increased by $1.5 million from $41.5 million to $43.0 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was due to increased revenues of $7.0 million while expenses increased by $5.5 million.        Income from property increased by $6.6 million from $132.4 million to $139.0 million, or 5.0 percent, due to rent increases and other community revenues ($6.5 million) and acquisitions ($4.4 million), offset by a revenue reduction of $4.3 million due to property dispositions.        Other income increased by $0.4 million from $14.1 million to $14.5 million due primarily to an increase in interest income ($1.3 million) offset by reductions in income from affiliate ($0.5 million) and other income ($0.4 million).        Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $0.6 million from $28.6 million to $29.2 million, or 2.0 percent, representing general cost increases ($1.0 million) and acquisitions ($0.7 million), offset by an expense reduction of $1.1 million due to property dispositions.        Real estate taxes increased by $0.4 million from $9.1 million to $9.5 million, or 4.5 percent, due to the acquired communities ($0.2 million) and changes in certain assessments.        Property management expenses decreased by $0.2 million from $2.9 million to $2.7                                          24  million, representing 2.0 percent and 2.2 percent of income from property in 2001 and 2000, respectively.        General and administrative expenses increased by $0.5 million from $4.1 million to $4.6 million, representing 3.0 percent and 2.8 percent of total revenues in 2001 and 2000, respectively.        Interest expense increased by $1.4 million from $29.6 million to $31.0 million due primarily to financing additional investments in rental property offset by decreasing rates on variable rate debt.        Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA" an alternative financial performance measure that may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, defined as total revenues less property operating and maintenance, real estate taxes, property management and general and administrative expenses) increased by $5.7 million from $101.8 million to $107.5 million. EBITDA as a percent of revenues increased to 70.0 percent in 2001 compared to 69.5 percent in 2000.        Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.8 million from $30.7 million to $33.5 million due primarily to the net additional investments in rental properties.  Comparison of year ended December 31, 2000 to year ended December 31, 1999        For the year ended December 31, 2000, income before gain from property dispositions, net and minority interests increased by $4.9 million from $36.6 million to $41.5 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase was due to increased revenues of $11.6 million while expenses increased by $6.7 million.        Income from property increased by $7.0 million from $125.4 million to $132.4 million, or 5.6 percent, due to rent increases and other community revenues ($5.3 million), acquisitions ($3.1 million), lease up of manufactured home sites ($2.2 million), offset by a revenue reduction of $3.6 million due to the sale of communities during 1999.        Other income increased by $4.6 million from $9.5 million to $14.1 million due primarily to an increase in interest income ($3.0 million) and other income ($2.7 million), offset by a $1.1 million reduction in income from affiliate.        Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $1.3 million from $27.3 million to $28.6 million, or 4.7 percent, due primarily to acquisitions ($0.8 million).        Real estate taxes increased by $0.2 million from $8.9 million to $9.1 million, or 2.5 percent, due primarily to the acquired communities.        Property management expenses increased by $0.3 million from $2.6 million to $2.9 million, or 11.2 percent, representing 2.2 percent and 2.1 percent of income from property in 2000 and 1999, respectively.        General and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million from $3.7 million to $4.1 million, or 10.8 percent, representing 2.8 percent and 2.7 percent of total revenues in 2000 and 1999, respectively.                                          25         Interest expense increased by $2.4 million from $27.3 million to $29.7 million due primarily to investments in rental property and notes receivable.        EBITDA increased by $9.4 million from $92.4 million to $101.8 million. EBITDA as a percent of revenues increased to 69.5 percent in 2000 compared to 68.5 percent in 1999.        Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.1 million from $28.6 million to $30.7 million due primarily to the acquisition and development/expansion of communities in 2000 and 1999.  SAME PROPERTY INFORMATION        The following table reflects property-level financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. The "Same Property" data represents information regarding the operation of communities owned as of January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. Site, occupancy, and rent data for those communities is presented as of the last day of each period presented. The "Total Portfolio" column differentiates from the "Same Property" column by including financial information for managed but not owned communities, recreational vehicle communities, new development and acquisition communities.

(2)   Includes 3 properties sold in December 2000.  On a same property basis, property revenues increased by $5.4 million from $99.9 million to $105.3 million, or 5.4 percent, due primarily to increases in rents and related charges including water and property tax pass through.  Property operating expenses increased by $0.8 million from $25.6 million to $26.4 million, or 3.2 percent, due to increased costs. Property EBITDA increased by $4.5 million from $74.4 million to $78.9 million, or 6.1 percent.                                          26  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES        The Company's principal liquidity demands have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, distributions to the Company's stockholders and the Operating Partnership's unitholders, property acquisitions, development and expansion of properties, capital improvements of properties and debt repayment.        The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through its working capital provided by operating activities and its line of credit, as described below. The Company considers its ability to generate cash from operations (anticipated to be approximately $70 million) to be adequate to meet all operating requirements, including recurring capital improvements, routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature, pay dividends to its stockholders to maintain qualification as a REIT in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and make distributions to the Operating Partnership's unitholders.        The Company plans to invest approximately $25 to $30 million in developments consisting of expansions to existing communities and the new or continuing development of new communities. The Company expects to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit.        Furthermore, the Company expects to invest in the range of $40 to $60 million in the acquisition of properties in 2002, depending upon market conditions. The Company plans to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit.        Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $13.9 million to $4.6 million at December 31, 2001 compared to $18.5 million at December 31, 2000 because cash used in investing and financing activities exceeded cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $9.2 million to $65.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase was primarily due to income before minority interests, depreciation and amortization and gain from property dispositions, net increasing by $4.0 million and other assets decreasing by $2.6 million, offset by accounts payable and other liabilities increasing by $2.5 million.        The Company's net cash flows provided by operating activities may be adversely impacted by, among other things: (a) the market and economic conditions in the Company's current markets generally, and specifically in metropolitan areas of the Company's current markets; (b) lower occupancy and rental rates of the Properties; (c) increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, real estate taxes and utilities, that cannot be passed on to the Company's tenants; and (d) decreased sales of manufactured homes. See "Factors that May Affect Future Results."        The Company's $150 million unsecured line of credit, which expires in January 2003, bears interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%. At December 31, 2001, the average interest rate of outstanding borrowings under the line of credit was 3.22%, $93 million was outstanding and $57 million was available to be drawn. The line of credit facility contains                                          27  various leverage, debt service coverage, net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2001.        The Company's primary long-term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness. At December 31, 2001, the Company's outstanding contractual obligations were as follows:                                                             Payments Due By Period                                                              (in thousands)                                               ---------------------------------------------- Contractual Cash Obligations(1)   Total Due   1 year   2-3 years   4-5 years   After 5 years - -------------------------------   ---------   ------   ---------   ---------   -------------            Line of credit                     $93,000              $93,000 Collateratized term loan            42,820     $ 614      1,365     $1,569       $39,272 Senior notes                       285,000               85,000                  200,000 Mortgage notes, other               48,333       857      2,719      7,986        36,771 Capitalized lease obligations       26,045    16,176      9,869 Redeemable Preferred OP Units       43,958                           3,564        40,394                                   --------   -------   --------    -------      --------                                   $539,156   $17,647   $191,953    $13,119      $316,437                                   ========   =======   ========    =======      ========   (1)   The Company is the guarantor of $23.2 million in personal bank loans which       is not reflected in the balance sheet, maturing in 2004, made to the       Company's directors, employees and consultants for the purpose of       purchasing shares of Company common stock or Operating Partnership OP       Units pursuant to the Company's Stock Purchase Plan. The Company is       obligated under the Guaranty only in the event that one or more of the       borrowers cannot repay their loan when due.        The Company anticipates meeting its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled debt maturities, large property acquisitions and Operating Partnership unit redemptions, through the issuance of debt or equity securities, including equity units in the Operating Partnership, or from selective asset sales. Along with Origen LLC's other investors, the Company may be requested to make additional capital contributions to maintain its respective ownership interest. The Company has maintained investment grade ratings with Fitch ICBA, Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's, which facilitates access to the senior unsecured debt market. Since 1993, the Company has raised, in the aggregate, $263.4 million from the sale of shares of its common stock, $84.2 from the sale of OP units in the Operating Partnership and $430 million from the issuance of secured and unsecured debt securities. In addition, at December 31, 2001, ninety-six of the Properties were unencumbered by debt, therefore, providing substantial financial flexibility. The ability of the Company to finance its long-term liquidity requirements in such manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time, including the availability and cost of mortgage debt, the financial condition of the Company, the operating history of the Properties, the state of the debt and equity markets, and the general national, regional and local economic conditions. See "Factors that May Affect Future Results". If the Company is unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing on acceptable terms, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed.        The terms of the $35.8 million of the Operating Partnership's Preferred OP units were renegotiated effective December 31, 2001. The conversion price increased from $27 per unit to at                                          28  least $68 per unit and the coupon rate was decreased from nine percent (9%) to seven percent (7%) for the first two years followed by a variable rate ranging from 6.5% to 8.5% with mandatory redemption on January 2, 2014.        At December 31, 2001, the Company's debt to total market capitalization approximated 36.7 percent (assuming conversion of all Common OP Units to shares of common stock). The debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.3 years and a weighted average interest rate of 6.6 percent.        Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 included recurring capital expenditures of $4.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively.        Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $34.3 million to $34.8 million from $69.1 million due to a $84.5 million increase in repayments from financing notes receivable, net offset by a $20.7 million increase in investment in and advances to affiliates, a $17.1 million decrease in proceeds related to property dispositions and a $12.5 million increase in rental property acquisition activities.        Net cash used in financing activities increased by $64.5 million to $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was primarily because of a $74.5 million increase in repayments on notes payable and $100 million reduced proceeds from notes payable offset by a $116.0 million increase in borrowings on the line of credit.  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES       The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 was 1.83:1, 1.87:1, and 1.95:1 respectively.  INDUSTRY CONDITIONS        According to the Manufactured Housing Institute, the shipments of new manufactured homes has declined from 373,000 in 1998 to 193,000 in 2001. This decline was caused primarily by the tightening of credit standards in response to an increasing number of repossessions. Beginning in 1999, repossessions increased as unqualified borrowers defaulted on their manufactured home loans. Financing standards tightened significantly reducing demand at a time of excessive inventories. Exacerbating this excess supply was the competition of aggressively priced repossessed homes which further slowed new home sales.        The Company expects these conditions to work themselves back into equilibrium. New home shipments increased in October 2001 as compared to October 2000, representing the first such year to year monthly increase since March 1999. Fourth quarter 2001 shipments exceeded fourth quarter 2000 shipments and the trend has continued through January 2002 with no sign of inventory accumulation. Repossessions are expected to remain at high levels throughout most, if not all, of 2002.        These conditions adversely impact the sale of new homes by Sun Homes, which harms the Company's profitability. Furthermore, these conditions cause a slow-down in the leasing of the Company's communities, especially newly developed expansions and new communities, which in turn slows the development of new sites causing the Company to hold non-income                                          29  producing land inventory longer.  INFLATION        Most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease expires. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." This Statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion). The provisions of this SFAS 144 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application encouraged. The provisions of this standard are generally to be applied prospectively. The Company does not expect a material impact from the adoption of this standard.        In June 2001, the FASB approved SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS 141 requires, among other things, that the purchase method of accounting for business combinations be used for all business combinations initiated after September 30, 2001. SFAS 142 addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS 142 requires, among other things, that goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets no longer be amortized and that such assets be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company does not expect these pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.                                          30  OTHER       Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as "net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus rental property depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures." Industry analysts consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating performance of an equity REIT primarily because the computation of FFO excludes historical cost depreciation as an expense and thereby facilitates the comparison of REITs which have different cost bases in their assets. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, whereas real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen based upon market conditions. FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, FFO is not intended as a measure of a REIT's ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements, nor as a measure of working capital.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK     The Company's principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company does not hedge interest rate risk using financial instruments nor is the Company subject to foreign currency risk on its long-term debt, mortgage notes and other notes receivable. The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to refinancing long-term fixed rate obligations, the opportunity cost of fixed rate obligations in a falling interest rate environment and its variable rate line of credit. The Company primarily enters into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including acquisitions, capital improvements and working capital needs.      The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk on its variable rate indebtedness by borrowing on a short term basis under its line of credit until such time as it is able to retire the short term variable rate debt with a long term fixed rate debt offering on terms that are advantageous.      The Company's variable rate debt is limited to its $150 million line of credit ($93.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2001) which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0 percent. If LIBOR increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during 2001 and 2000, the Company believes its interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.7 million and $0.5 million based on the $69.2 million and $49.9 million average balance outstanding under the Company's line of credit for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.      Additionally, the Company has $49.0 million LIBOR based variable rate mortgage and other notes receivables at December 31, 2001. If LIBOR increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during 2001 and 2000, the Company believes interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.8 million and $0.7 million based on the $79.5 million and $68.0 million average balance outstanding on all variable rate notes receivables for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.                                         32  ITEM 8.
