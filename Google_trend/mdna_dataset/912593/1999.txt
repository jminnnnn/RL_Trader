ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW           The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Comparison of year ended December 31, 1998 to year ended December 31, 1997           For the year ended December 31, 1998, income before other, net and minority interests increased by $3.5 million from $27.9 million to $31.4 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase was due to increased revenues of $24.3 million while expenses increased by $20.9 million.           Income from property increased by $21.1 million from $93.2 million to $114.3 million due primarily to the acquisition of 10 communities comprising approximately 2,100 developed sites during 1998 and 14 communities comprising approximately 5,200 developed sites during 1997.           Income from affiliates increased by $2.9 million to $4.4 million from $1.5 million due to increased sales of homes by Sun Home Services, Inc. ("SHS") and interest income earned on advances to Bingham Financial Services Corporation ("BFSC").           Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $4.5 million from $21.1 million to $25.6 million due primarily to the acquired communities.           Real estate taxes increased by $1.2 million from $7.5 million to $8.7 million due primarily to the acquired communities.           Property management expenses increased by $.4 million from $1.9 million to $2.3 million representing 2.0 percent of income from property in 1998 and 1997.           General and administrative expenses increased by $.7 million from $2.6 million to $3.3 million due primarily to additional staff and facilities as a result of the Company's growth.           Interest expense increased by $9.7 million from $14.5 million to $24.2 million due primarily to investments in rental property. Included in interest is amortization of deferred finance costs of $.7 million and $.2 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively.           Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") increased by $17.5 million from $63.1 million to $80.6 million. EBITDA as a percent of revenues was 66.8% compared to 65.6% in 1997.           Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.3 million from $20.7 million to $25.0 million due primarily to the acquisition of communities in 1998 and 1997.           Included in other, net of $.6 million are $1.5 million in net gains on asset sales offset by $.9 million related to an unsuccessful portfolio acquisition.                                              -13-    14  Comparison of year ended December 31, 1997 to year ended December 31, 1996           For the year ended December 31, 1997, income before other, net, extraordinary item and minority interests increased by $5.9 million from $22.0 million to $27.9 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase was due to increased revenues of $23.0 million while expenses increased by $17.1 million.           Income from property increased by $21.9 million from $71.3 million to $93.2 million due primarily to the acquisition and financing of 14 communities comprising approximately 5,200 developed sites during 1997 and 29 communities comprising in excess of 11,300 developed sites during 1996.           Income from affiliates increased by $1.0 million to $1.5 million from $.5 million due to increased sales of homes by SHS and interest income earned on advances to BFSC.           Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $5.1 million from $16.0 million to $21.1 million due primarily to the acquired communities.           Real estate taxes increased by $1.8 million from $5.7 million to $7.5 million due primarily to the acquired communities.           Property management expenses increased by $.7 million to $1.9 million from $1.2 million representing 2.0 percent and 1.7 percent of income from property in 1997 and 1996, respectively.           General and administrative expenses increased by $.4 million from $2.2 million to $2.6 million due primarily to additional staff and facilities as a result of the Company's growth.           Interest expense increased by $3.2 million from $11.3 million to $14.5 million due primarily to $150 million Senior Notes which were issued May 1, 1996. Included in interest is amortization of deferred finance costs of $.2 million in 1997 and 1996.           EBITDA increased by $15.0 million from $48.1 million to $63.1 million. EBITDA as a percent of revenues was 65.6% compared to 65.7% in 1996.           Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $5.8 million from $14.9 million to $20.7 million due primarily to the acquisition of communities in 1997 and 1996.  SAME PROPERTY INFORMATION           The following table reflects property-level financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997. The "Same Property" data represents information regarding the operation of communities owned as of January 1, 1997. Site, occupancy, and rent data for those communities is presented as of the last day of each period presented. The table includes sites where the Company's interest is in the form of shared appreciation notes or where the Company is providing financing and managing the properties. Such amounts relate to 766 sites in 1998 and 1,873 sites in 1997.                                               -14-    15                                                                             SAME PROPERTY                   TOTAL PORTFOLIO                                                                             -------------                   ---------------                                                                         1998             1997           1998              1997                                                                      ----             ----           ----              ----                                                                       (In Thousands)                  (In Thousands)           Income from property                                         $    75,954        $  70,580      $  114,346       $    93,188                                                              -----------        ---------      ----------       -----------      Property operating expenses:                                                                                                             Property operating and maintenance                        14,223           13,927          25,647            21,111              Real estate taxes                                          6,573            5,987           8,728             7,481                                                                   -----------        ---------      ----------       -----------                      Property operating expenses                       20,796           19,914          34,375            28,592                                                                   -----------        ---------      ----------       -----------       Property EBITDA                                              $    55,158        $  50,666      $   79,971       $    64,596                                                                   ===========        =========      ==========       ===========       Number of properties                                                  72               72             104                99      Developed sites                                                   24,979           24,164          37,566            35,936      Occupied sites                                                    23,482           22,907          34,644            33,415      Occupancy %                                                         94.0% (1)        94.7% (1)       94.3% (1)         95.0% (1)   Weighted average monthly rent per site                       $       266  (1)   $     254  (1) $      267  (1)  $       255  (1)   Sites available for development                                    1,316            2,142           6,924             3,641      Sites under development                                              145              542           2,019               904         (1) Occupancy % and weighted average rent relates to manufactured housing          sites, excluding recreational vehicle sites.           On a same property basis, property revenues increased by $5.4 million from $70.6 million to $76.0 million, or 7.6 percent, due primarily to increases in rents and occupancy related charges including water and property tax pass throughs. Also contributing to revenue growth was the increase of 575 leased sites at December 31, 1998 compared to December 31, 1997.           Property operating expenses increased by $.9 million from $19.9 million to $20.8 million, or 4.4 percent, due to increased occupancies and costs and increases in assessments and millage by local taxing authorities. Property EBITDA increased by $4.5 million from $50.7 million to $55.2 million, or 8.9 percent.  LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS           Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $12.4 million from $40.2 million to $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. This increase was due primarily to a $7.8 million increase in income before depreciation and amortization, minority interests and other, net and a $6.3 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities offset by a $2.1 million increase in other assets.           Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $2.0 million from $107.7 million to $105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. This was due to a $7.9 million reduction of cash used for notes receivable and investment in and advances to affiliates offset by a $5.9 million increase in investment in rental properties, net of proceeds from asset sales.           Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $.1 million from $60.5 million to $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. This increase was due to a $12.8 million increase in proceeds from net borrowings including payments for deferred financing costs, offset by an increase of $3.4 million in distributions and a $9.3 million reduction in proceeds from sales of common stock and OP units.                                          -15-    16            The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements generally through its working capital provided by operating activities. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and property acquisitions through the issuance of equity or debt securities, or interests in the Operating Partnership. The Company considers these sources to be adequate and anticipates they will continue to be adequate to meet operating requirements, capital improvements, investment in development, and payment of distributions by the Company in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long term. The Company can also meet these short-term and long-term requirements by utilizing its $100 million line of credit which bears interest at LIBOR plus .90% and is due November 1, 1999.           At December 31, 1998, the Company's debt to total market capitalization approximated 32.4% (assuming conversion of all Common and Preferred OP Units to shares of common stock), with a weighted average maturity of approximately 6.1 years and a weighted average interest rate of 7.07%.           Capital expenditures for 1998 included recurring capital expenditures of $5.3 million including $.4 million for additional space and related costs at corporate headquarters and revenue producing capital expenditures of $.9 million which principally consisted of water metering programs.  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES           The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 was 2.04:1, 2.40:1, and 2.49:1 respectively.  INFLATION           Most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease expires. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.  SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT           This Form 10-K contains various "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. The words "may", "will", "expect", "believe", "anticipate", "should", "estimate", and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance, but are based upon current assumptions regarding the Company's operations, future results and prospects, and are subject to many uncertainties and factors relating to the Company's operations and business environment which may cause the actual results of the Company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Please see the section entitled "Risk Factors" of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 1999 for a list of uncertainties and factors.           Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) changes in the general economic climate; (ii) increased competition in the geographic areas in which the Company owns and operates manufactured housing communities; (iii) changes in government laws and regulations affecting manufactured housing communities; and (iv) the ability of the Company to continue to identify, negotiate and acquire manufactured housing communities and/or vacant land which may be developed into manufactured housing communities on terms favorable to the Company. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.                                             -16-    17  YEAR 2000 UPDATE           The Year 2000 ("Y2K") issue concerns the inability of computerized information systems and non-information systems to accurately calculate, store or use a date after 1999. This could result in computer system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations.           In 1997, the Company implemented a corporate-wide Y2K program to minimize any such disruption caused by the failures of its own internal systems or those of its business supply chain. In the first phase of the project, the Company reviewed its inventory of computer hardware and software, and other devices with embedded microprocessors. The Company also discussed its software applications and internal operational programs with its current information systems' vendors. Finally, in this assessment phase, key members of the business supply chain were contacted and interviewed regarding their awareness of the Y2K problem and the status of their own Y2K project. The first phase was completed on schedule during 1998 and all key members of the Company's business supply chain reported that they were aware of the Y2K problem and were in the process of readying for the Y2K issue.           In the second phase of the project, all systems found to be Y2K non-compliant were upgraded, fixed, replaced and tested. The second phase was also completed on schedule in December 1998. The Company believes that as a result of this Implementation/Testing phase, its applications and programs will properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year 2000. The Company plans to continue monitoring Y2K communications from its software vendors and anticipates that some vendors will recommend further patches/upgrades and testing.           In the third and final phase of the Y2K program, the Company is surveying its material third-party service providers, such as its banks, payroll processor, stock transfer agent and telecommunications provider. The purpose of the survey is to follow-up on the status of their Y2K compliance efforts and assess what effect their possible non-compliance might have on the Company. In addition, the Company is discussing with its material vendors the possibility of any interface difficulties and/or electrical or mechanical problems relating to Y2K which may affect properties owned or operated by the Company. The Company plans to complete its assessment of Y2K compliance by such parties by April 30, 1999. Until such time, the Company cannot estimate any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of vendors or third-party service providers to address their Y2K issues; however, to date, no significant Y2K related conditions have been identified.           Expenditures for assessing the Company's Y2K issues have not been material because the evaluation has been conducted by its own personnel or by its vendors in connection with their servicing operations. The Company has contracted a consultant for $25,000 to assess the methodology of its Y2K program. The Company plans to remedy any exceptions found during this review process and deemed as material by the Company by June 30, 1999.           Based on its current information, the Company believes that the risk posed by any foreseeable Y2K related problem with its internal systems and the systems at its properties (including both information and non-information systems) or with its vendors is minimal. Y2K related problems with the Company's software applications and internal operational programs or with the electrical or mechanical systems at its properties are unlikely to cause more than minor disruptions in the Company's operations. The Company believes that the risk posed by Y2K related problems for certain third-party service providers is marginally greater, though, based on its current information, the Company does not believe any such problems would have a material effect on its operations. Any Y2K related problems at these third-party service providers could delay the processing of financial transactions or payroll and could disrupt the Company's internal and external communications.                                              -17-    18           While the Company believes that it will be Y2K capable by December 31, 1999, there can be no assurance that the Company has been or will be successful in identifying and assessing Y2K issues, or that, to the extent identified, the Company's efforts to resolve such issues will be effective such that Y2K issues will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operation.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS           In June 1998, FASB issued SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). This Statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities. This statement will be adopted effective January 1, 2000. The Company has not yet determined the impact of SFAS 133 on the earnings and financial position of the Company.  OTHER           Industry analysts consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity REIT. It is defined as income before minority interests plus non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK           The Company's principle market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to refinancing long-term fixed rate obligations, the opportunity cost of fixed rate obligations in a falling interest rate environment and its variable rate line of credit. The Company primarily enters into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including acquisitions, capital improvements and working capital needs. The Company has used interest rate hedge agreements to hedge against rising interest rates in anticipation of refinancing or new debt issuance. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as it relates to hedging transactions is described in Note 4 "Debt" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.
