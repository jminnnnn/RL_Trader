ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW           The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein.           The Company is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT which owns, operates, develops and finances manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern United States. As of December 31, 2004, the Company owned and operated a portfolio of 136 developed properties located in eighteen states, including 124 manufactured housing communities, five recreational vehicle communities, and seven properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites.           The Company completed a significant restructuring of its capital and operating debt during 2004. Secured debt financings of $734 million with average terms approximating 10 years and weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.0% were concluded, as well as the successful negotiation of a new $115 million revolving line of credit at LIBOR + 1.75%. Proceeds from the secured financings were used to retire existing debt, acquire communities, and repurchase the Company's stock. The Company has also provided the required notice to retire $50 million of 8.875% PPOP Units during the first quarter of 2005 and is authorized to repurchase up to 1 million additional shares of its stock.           During 2004 the Company acquired nine manufactured housing communities comprising approximately 2950 developed and 570 undeveloped sites. The aggregate purchase price was $120.4 million and included the assumption of approximately $34.3 million in debt. Three of the communities are in northeast Atlanta, four are located in Michigan and the remaining properties are located in Colorado and Texas.           In recent years the operations of manufactured homebuilders, dealers, and the companies that finance the purchase of the homes have experienced severe losses and substantial volatility. New home shipments have declined from approximately 373,000 in 1998 to approximately 131,000 in 2004. The decline was largely due to the turmoil in the financing side of the industry as lenders experienced substantial losses arising from defaults on poorly underwritten loans in the mid to late 1990s and beyond. As a result of the losses, the lenders experienced liquidity constraints and significantly tightened underwriting standards thus reducing the demand for new homes.           These trends appear to be abating as several large home manufacturers are reporting operating income and the volume of repossessed homes in the market place appears to be declining. Newly repossessed homes are also declining as the reinforcing effects of tightened underwriting standards and reduced new home financing volumes impact the industry.                                          28            The effect of these trends on the Company has been to reduce occupancies in our portfolio as the demand of tenants for sites in our communities has declined for the above-stated reasons. The rate of leasing in our new community developments has likewise slowed. Despite these trends, the Company's same property portfolio has consistently reflected growth in net operating income evidencing the revenue and operating stability long associated with the business of owning and operating manufactured housing communities.           While the problems which directly impacted the manufacturers, dealers, and lenders appear to be bottoming, the Company does not expect a rapid or strong recovery in its operations. The Company expects a gradually improving leasing environment in its portfolio.           As a result of these industry conditions, a large quantity of homes repossessed by lenders have become available for purchase at discounts of up to 50% and more from original cost or loan amount. The Company has made every effort to acquire these value-priced homes especially as the alternative would likely be the removal of the homes from the community. Such removal would create total dependence on the sale of a new home to fill the site. As new home shipments have declined by nearly two thirds from their peak in 1998 to current levels, such dependence would leave the Company vulnerable to a recovery in new home shipments as its primary method to improve occupancy.           The Company intends to sell these value-priced homes to residents over time. In the meantime it is most economical to rent the homes. At December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately 2,000 homes rented in its communities which comprise over 46,000 sites. All renters are subject to underwriting criteria. The Company expects to continue to acquire homes from lenders as long as the pricing of the homes remains compelling. The Company is actively developing programs for its renters and others to acquire these homes.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES           Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements. Nevertheless, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.           Management believes the following significant accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:           Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Rental property is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The Company measures the recoverability of its assets in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." If such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement, the impairment that would be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined on a                                          29   discounted net cash flow basis. Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances that may prompt a test of recoverability may include a significant decrease in anticipated market price, an adverse change to the extent or manner in which an asset may be used or in its physical condition or other such events that may significantly change the value of the long-lived asset.           Notes Receivable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its notes receivable whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The loan is then measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flow discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.           Depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives are 30 years for land improvements and buildings and 7 to 15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment.           Revenue Recognition. Rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight-line basis when earned from tenants. Leases entered into by tenants generally range from month-to-month to one year and are renewable by mutual agreement of the Company and the resident or, in some cases, as provided by state statute. Revenue from the sale of manufactured homes is recognized upon transfer of title at the closing of the sales transaction. The Company offers, through its Home Buying Made Easy program, retail installment contracts at interest rates of 4.99 to 7.99 percent to qualified buyers of homes within its communities. The Company amortizes the interest discount from current market rates related to this program into income over the term of the note. The Company also bifurcates the discounted present value of the interest differential between the home sale and the anticipated rental revenue as required by Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21 "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables". The differential allocated to the home sale is recognized as a reduction of revenue from the sale of the home and the differential allocated to future rental revenue is amortized as rental discount over the term of the loan.           Capitalized Costs. The Company capitalizes certain costs (including interest and other costs) incurred in connection with the development, redevelopment, capital enhancement and leasing of its properties. Management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization. The amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities. Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred. Renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete. Certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period. Costs associated with implementing the Company's computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware.                                           30            Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company has entered into three interest rate swap agreements to offset interest rate risk. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. The Company adjusts its balance sheet on an ongoing quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of its derivatives. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income, as appropriate. The ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged. The unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings over time and occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings. The Company uses standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments, including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized.           Income Taxes. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT as defined under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the Company's gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes at least ninety percent (90%) of its REIT ordinary taxable income to its stockholders, which it fully intends to do. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Company remains subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property as well as Federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.                                                     31   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Comparison of year ended December 31, 2004 to year ended December 31, 2003           For the year ended December 31, 2004, income from operations decreased by $64.7 million from income of $23.3 million to a loss of $(41.4) million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was due to increased expenses of $14.5 million, debt extinguishment costs of $51.6 million, deferred financing costs related to the extinguished debt of $5.6 million, Florida storm damage of $0.6 million, and decreased equity income from affiliate of $0.8 million, offset by increased revenues of $8.4 million as described in more detail below.           Income from rental property increased by $8.7 million from $159.1 million to $167.8 million, or 5.5 percent, due to property acquisitions, rent increases, and other community revenues.           Interest income, including income from Origen, decreased by $4.8 million from $11.4 million to $6.6 million, or 42.1 percent, due primarily to a decrease in interest earning notes and receivables.           Other operating income increased by $0.2 million from $0.7 million to $0.9 million, due primarily to increase in brokerage commissions.           The decrease in revenue from home sales and increase in gain on sale of land relate to operations of the manufactured home sales which is discussed in detail below.           Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $2.0 million from $39.8 million to $41.8 million, or 5.0 percent. The increase was due to increases in utility costs ($0.7 million), payroll expense ($0.5 million), repair and maintenance expense ($0.2 million), insurance expense ($0.3 million), and miscellaneous other expenses ($0.3 million).           Real estate taxes increased by $2.1 million from $11.7 million to $13.8 million, or 17.9 percent due to acquisitions made in 2004 ($0.7 million) and increases in assessments and tax rates ($1.4 million).           General and administrative expenses for rental property increased by $2.0 million from $10.5 million to $12.5 million, due to compensation expenses ($0.7 million), Michigan Single Business tax ($0.3 million), system conversion costs ($0.4 million), Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance costs ($0.3 million), and miscellaneous other expenses ($0.3 million).           Depreciation and amortization increased by $1.3 million from $44.1 million to $45.4 million, or 2.9 percent, due primarily to additional investment in rental property.           Interest expense increased by $9.5 million from $38.7 million to $48.2 million, or 24.5 percent, due to increased debt levels somewhat offset by lower interest rates and the reclassification of dividends paid on Preferred Operating Partnership Units ("POP Units") as interest expense pursuant to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liability and Equity" ("SFAS 150").                                            32            Debt extinguishment expense of $51.6 million includes prepayment penalties, fees and other costs associated with extinguishing $345.0 million of unsecured notes. Deferred financing costs related to these notes and other debt repaid were expensed.

Pre-owned home unit sales increased by 30.0 percent while revenues and cost of sales increased by 24.4 percent and 43.5 percent, respectively. Gross profit declined by 31.0 percent on pre-owned homes in response to a management strategy to reduce sales price to generate additional sales.   Comparison of year ended December 31, 2003 to year ended December 31, 2002           For the year ended December 31, 2003, income from operations increased by $1.7 million from $21.6 million to $23.3 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was due to increased revenues of $32.3 million and increased results from affiliates of $17.3 million partially offset by increased expenses of $47.9 million. The year 2003 included SHS on a consolidated basis as discussed below.           Income from rental property increased by $9.2 million from $149.9 million to $159.1 million, or 6.2 percent, due to rent increases and other community revenues ($3.4 million) and acquisitions ($5.8 million).           Interest income, including income from Origen, increased by $3.4 million from $8.0 million to $11.4 million, or 42.1 percent, due principally to larger outstanding balances of notes and investments at higher rates of interest.                                           33            Other operating income decreased by $1.6 million from $2.3 million to $0.7 million, due primarily to reduced development fee income.           The remaining revenue increases of $21.3 million relate to the consolidation of Sun Home Services which is discussed in detail below.           Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $6.1 million from $33.7 million to $39.8 million, or 18.0 percent. The increase was primarily due to increases in utility costs ($1.8 million) and increases in repair and maintenance expenses ($1.3 million). Acquisitions during 2002 and the consolidation of SunChamp properties accounted for the remaining increase of $3.0 million.           Real estate taxes increased by $1.5 million from $10.2 million to $11.7 million, or 15.0 percent due to acquisitions made in 2002 ($0.7 million) and increases in assessments and tax rate ($0.8 million).           General and administrative expenses increased by $8.9 million from $7.7 million to $16.6 million, due to the consolidation of Sun Home Services ($6.0 million), professional fees ($0.4 million), expenses related to office relocation ($0.2 million), Michigan Single Business tax ($0.2 million), compensation expenses, including benefits, primarily related to the SunChamp acquisition and a systems conversion ($1.7 million), and assorted other minor increases ($0.4 million).           Depreciation and amortization increased by $6.2 million from $37.9 million to $44.1 million, or 16.4 percent, due primarily to the consolidation of Sun Home Services ($1.0 million) and additional investment in rental property.           Interest expense increased by $6.3 million from $32.4 million to $38.7 million, or 19.4 percent, due to increased debt levels partially offset by lower interest rates ($1.5 million), the reclassification of dividends paid on POP Units as interest expense pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 150 ($2.0 million), decreased capitalized interest ($0.8 million), an increase in financing costs ($0.6 million), and an increase in interest rates related to fixing rates on $75.0 million of debt ($2.7 million). These increases were partially offset by $1.3 million of income related primarily to the change in market value of an interest rate swap contract that does not qualify for hedge accounting.           The $4.9 million impairment charge relates to a reduction in the book value of a new community development due to the impracticality of future phase construction.           Equity income from affiliates of $0.7 million represents the Company's one-third interest in the operations of Origen for its initial operating period after a recapitalization in October, 2003.           The remaining expense increase of $13.9 million relates to the consolidation of Sun Home Services which is discussed in detail below.                                           34   Sun Home Services           Prior to January 1, 2003, the results of operations of Sun Home Services were accounted for using the equity method and reported as a single line item called equity in income from affiliates. As the Company is the primary beneficiary of the results of operations of Sun Home Services, it is appropriate to consolidate Sun Home Services at December 31, 2003.

In the table below, the year 2002 is presented as if SHS was consolidated ("Proforma") as of December 31, 2002 for comparative purposes.           The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for Sun Home Services for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002:                                                                                     Increase/                                            2003               2002             (Decrease)       Percent Change                                           -------            -------           -----------     ----------------                                                            (Pro Forma)          New home sales revenues                   $13,169            $15,890            $(2,721)            -17.1% Cost of sales                               9,159             12,907             (3,748)            -29.0%                                           -------            -------            -------             ----- Gross profit                                4,010              2,983              1,027              34.4%                                           =======            =======            =======             =====  Pre-owned home sales revenues             $ 6,347            $ 3,214            $ 3,133              97.5% Cost of sales                               4,720              2,586              2,134              82.5%                                           -------            -------            -------             ----- Gross profit                                1,627                628                999             159.1%                                           =======            =======            =======             =====  Ancillary revenue, net                    $ 1,791            $   457            $ 1,334             291.9%                                           =======            =======            =======             =====  Home sales volumes:      New homes                                257                286                (29)            -10.1%      Pre-owned homes                          283                174                109              62.6%             New home sales declined by 10.1 percent, while revenues and costs of sales declined by 17.1 and 29.0 percent, respectively. Gross profit increased by 34.4 percent as cost of sales declined by more than revenues due to the purchase of new homes at a substantial discount. Pre-owned home unit sales increased by 62.6 percent while revenues and cost of sales increased by 97.5 percent and 82.5 percent, respectively. Gross profit increased by 159.1 percent as revenues grew more than cost of sales due to strong demand for the value in pre-owned homes.           The increase in ancillary revenue, net, is primarily due to increased activity in the Company's rental home program.                                                 35   SAME PROPERTY INFORMATION           The following table reflects property-level financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

NOI is derived from revenues (determined in accordance with GAAP) minus property operating expenses and real estate taxes (determined in accordance with GAAP). NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company's financial performance or to be an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measurement to net operating income. Net income includes interest and depreciation and amortization which often have no effect on the market value of a property and therefore limit its use as a performance measure. In addition, such expenses are often incurred at a parent company level and therefore are not necessarily linked to the performance of a real estate asset. The Company believes that net operating income is helpful to investors as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment, and provides a method of comparing property performance over time. The Company uses NOI as a key management tool when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and/or groups of properties. The principal limitation of NOI is that it excludes depreciation, amortization and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses, all of which are significant costs, and therefore, NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the properties of the Company rather than of the Company overall.  (2) Occupancy % and weighted average rent relates to manufactured housing sites, excluding recreational vehicle sites.                                          36           On a same property basis, property net operating income increased by $4.3 million from $102.0 million to $106.3 million, or 4.2 percent. Income from property increased by $5.7 million from $141.1 million to $146.8 million, or 4.0 percent, due primarily to increases in rents including water and property tax pass through.          Property operating expenses increased by $1.3 million from $39.2 million to $40.5 million, or 3.3 percent, due to increases in real estate taxes ($1.1 million), utilities and other ($0.2 million).  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES          The Company's principal liquidity demands have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, distributions to the Company's stockholders and the unitholders of the Operating Partnership, property acquisitions, development and expansion of properties, capital improvements of properties, the purchase of new and pre-owned homes and debt repayment.          The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through its working capital provided by operating activities and through its $115.0 million line of credit. The Company considers these resources to be adequate to meet all operating requirements, including recurring capital improvements, routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature, pay dividends to its stockholders to maintain qualification as a REIT in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and make distributions to the Operating Partnership's unitholders.          The Company plans to invest approximately $2 to $5 million in developments consisting of expansions to existing communities and the development of new communities during 2005. The Company expects to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit.          Furthermore, the Company may invest substantial amounts in the acquisition of properties during 2005, depending upon a number of factors, including the availability of high-quality properties that meet the Company's criteria for acquisition. The Company will finance these investments using the proceeds from its secured financing transactions, the temporary use of its line of credit until permanent secured financing can be arranged and through the assumption of existing debt on the properties.          Cash and cash equivalents increased by $28.5 million to $52.6 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $24.1 million at December 31, 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $4.8 million to $57.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $62.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.          The Company's net cash flows provided by operating activities may be adversely impacted by, among other things: (a) the market and economic conditions in the Company's markets; (b) lower occupancy rates of the Properties; (c) increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, real estate taxes and utilities, that cannot be passed on to the Company's tenants; and (d) decreased sales or rentals of manufactured homes. See "Factors that May Affect Future Results."          As previously discussed, the Company completed a significant restructuring of its capital                                          37   and operating debt during 2004. The Company securitized an additional 74 of its 136 Properties providing significant proceeds for the repayment of existing higher rate debt, property acquisitions and stock repurchases.          During 2004 the Company acquired nine manufactured housing communities with an aggregate purchase price of $120.4 million. The properties were purchased with cash provided from secured financing transactions and the assumption of approximately $34.3 million in debt.          The Company has a $115 million unsecured line of credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR + 1.75% and matures in September 2007, with a one-year optional extension. At December 31, 2004, $1.3 million of availability was used to back standby letters of credit and $113.7 million was available to be drawn under the facility. The line of credit facility contains various leverage, debt service coverage, net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2004.          The Company's primary long-term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness. At December 31, 2004, the Company's outstanding contractual obligations were as follows:                                                                                PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD                                                                                (IN THOUSANDS)                                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS                    TOTAL DUE        1 YEAR           2-3 YEARS        4-5 YEARS     AFTER 5 YEARS                                                ----------       ----------       ----------       ----------     -------------            Collateralized term loan                       $   40,837       $      757       $   40,080       $     --         $     -- Collateralized term loan - FNMA                   389,154            1,531            6,149            7,993          373,481 Collateralized term loan - B of A                 496,031             --              8,709           15,851          471,471 Senior notes                                        5,017            5,017             --               --               -- Mortgage notes, other                              85,280           13,432           48,635           18,452            4,761 Redeemable Preferred OP Units                      62,123             --             12,675             --             49,448                                                ----------       ----------       ----------       ----------       ----------                                                $1,078,442       $   20,737       $  116,248       $   42,296       $  899,161                                                ==========       ==========       ==========       ==========       ==========            Interest expense is a material cash requirement of the Company. The Company's projected interest expense is $57.9 million, $56.3 million, $61.9 million, $62.8 million, and $61.3 million for the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively.           The Company anticipates meeting its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled debt maturities, large property acquisitions, and Operating Partnership unit redemptions through the collateralization of a significant portion of its Properties. From time to time, the Company may also issue shares of its capital stock, issue equity units in the Operating Partnership or sell selected assets. The ability of the Company to finance its long-term liquidity requirements in such manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time, including the availability and cost of mortgage debt, the financial condition of the Company, the operating history of the Properties, the state of the debt and equity markets, and the general national, regional and local economic conditions. See "Factors That May Affect Future Results". If the Company is unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted.                                            38           At December 31, 2004, the Company's debt to total market capitalization approximated 54.8 percent (assuming conversion of all Common OP Units to shares of common stock). The debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately 8.5 years and a weighted average interest rate of 5.1 percent.          Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 included recurring capital expenditures of $6.6 million (excluding $0.4 million related to a software conversion) and $6.5 million (excluding $1.7 million related to a main office relocation and $3.4 million related to software conversion), respectively.          Net cash used in investing activities was $152.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $58.2 million in the prior year. The difference is due to: increased investment in rental properties of $97.7 million; increased short-term investments of $45.0 million; decreased proceeds from property and land disposition of $14.2 million; decreased repayments of notes receivables and officer's notes, net of $11.7 million; offset by a reduction in investment in and advances to affiliate of $49.1 million, and increased net proceeds from loans sold to and purchased from Origen of $25.5 million.          Net cash provided by financing activities was $122.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $17.0 million in the prior year. The difference is primarily due to changes in net proceeds from notes payable and other debt, inclusive of repayments on line of credit, of $177.0 million, offset by increased distributions of $1.9 million, changes in net proceeds from common stock issuance of $25.2 million, increased payments of deferred financing costs of $6.8 million, and treasury stock purchases of $37.2 million.  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES           The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2004 was less than 1:1. The earnings deficiency required to bring the ratio to 1:1 is $46.1 million. The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was 1.29:1 and 1.68:1, respectively.  INFLATION           Most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease expires. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.                                                    39   SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT          This Form 10-K contains various "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Company intends that such forward-looking statements will be subject to the safe harbors created thereby.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS          In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Share-Based Payment Statement No. 123(R), that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Under the FASB's statement, all forms of share-based payments to employees, including employee stock options, must be treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the income statement. The expense of the award would generally be measured at fair value at the grant date. Current accounting guidance requires that the expense relating to so-called fixed plan employee stock options only be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. The Statement eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees for options granted after June 15, 2005. We will be required to apply SFAS No. 123(R) as of the first interim reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, and we plan to adopt it using the modified-prospective method, effective July 1, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its results of operations and financial position.                                                    40    OTHER          Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is a useful supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not readily apparent from net income. Management believes that the use of FFO has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful.          Because FFO excludes significant economic components of net income including depreciation and amortization, FFO should be used as an adjunct to net income and not as an alternative to net income. The principal limitation of FFO is that it does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, FFO is not intended as a measure of a REIT's ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements, nor as a measure of working capital. FFO only provides investors with an additional performance measure. Other REITS may use different methods for calculating FFO and, accordingly, the Company's FFO may not be comparable to other REITs.          The following table reconciles net income to FFO and calculates FFO data for both basic and diluted purposes for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002 (in thousands):                                                 41                               SUN COMMUNITIES, INC.

The valuation adjustment reflects the theoretical noncash profit    and loss were those hedging transactions terminated at the balance sheet    date. As the Company has no expectation of terminating the transactions prior    to maturity, the net of these noncash valuation adjustments will be zero at    the various maturities. As any imperfection related to hedging correlation in    these swaps is reflected currently in cash as interest, the valuation    adjustments reflect volatility that would distort the comparative measurement    of FFO and on a net basis approximate zero. Accordingly, the valuation    adjustments are excluded from FFO. The valuation adjustment is included in    interest expense.  (2)The Company acquired the equity interest of another investor in SunChamp in    December 2002. Consideration consisted of a long-term note payable at net    book value. Although the adjustment for the allocation of the SunChamp losses    (based on SunChamp as a stand-alone entity) is not reflected in the    accompanying financial statements, management believes that it is appropriate    to provide for this adjustment because the Company's payment obligations with    respect to the note are subordinate in all respects to the return of the    members' equity (including the gross book value of the acquired equity) plus    a preferred return. As a result, the losses that are allocated to the Company    from SunChamp as a stand-alone entity under generally accepted accounting    principles are effectively reallocated to the note for purposes of    calculating FFO. A situation such as this is not contemplated in the NAREIT    definition of FFO due to the unique circumstances of the transaction.    Although not comparable to the precise NAREIT definition, the Company    believes the inclusion of this item in its calculation of FFO to be    appropriate as noted above.                                          42   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK           The Company's principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company mitigates this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage, minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures, which include the periodic use of derivatives. The Company's primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that changes in interest rates could have on its future cash flows. The Company generally employs derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.           The Company has entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement. One of the swap agreements fixes $25 million of variable rate borrowings at 4.93 percent for the period April 2003 through July 2009, another of the swap agreements fixes $25 million of variable rate borrowings at 5.37 percent for the period April 2003 through July 2012 and the third swap agreement, which is only effective for so long as 90-day LIBOR is 7 percent or less, fixes $25 million of variable rate borrowings at 3.97 percent for the period April 2003 through July 2007. The interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of 9.49 percent, a notional amount of $152.4 million and a termination date of April 13, 2006. Each of the Company's derivative contracts is based upon 90-day LIBOR.           The Company's remaining variable rate debt totals $108.5 million as of December 31, 2004 which bears interest at Prime, various LIBOR or FNMA Discounted Mortgage Backed Securities ("DMBS") rates. If Prime, LIBOR, or DMBS increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company believes its interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, based on the $169.5 million and $219.8 million average balance outstanding under the Company's variable rate debt facilities for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.           Additionally, the Company had $14.7 million and $32.1 million LIBOR based variable rate mortgage and other notes receivable as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. If LIBOR increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company believes interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.19 million and $0.30 million, respectively, based on the $19.3 million and $30.2 million average balance outstanding on all variable rate notes receivable for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
