ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         Introduction             We are a diversified broadcasting company that owns and operates, provides programming services pursuant to LMAs or provides sales services pursuant to outsourcing agreements to more television stations than all but one other commercial broadcasting group in the United States. We currently own, provide programming services pursuant to LMAs or provide sales services to 62 television stations in 39 markets. We currently have duopolies where we own and operate two stations in ten markets; own and operate a station and provide programming and operating services to a second station in nine markets; and own a station and provide or are provided sales, operational and managerial services to a second station in four markets.            Our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and, to a much lesser extent, from political advertisers and television network compensation. Our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward and revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of gross broadcast revenue. We believe this trend is primarily the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues, from a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and from an increase in the number of media outlets providing national advertisers a means by which to advertise their goods or services. Our efforts to mitigate the effect of increasing national media outlets include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative marketing strategies to sell traditional and non-traditional services to national advertisers.            Our primary operating expenses are syndicated program rights fees, commissions on revenues, employee salaries, and news-gathering and station promotional costs. Amortization and depreciation of costs associated with the acquisition of the stations and interest carrying charges are significant factors in determining our overall profitability.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, income taxes, program contract costs, property and equipment, intangible assets, investments, and derivative contracts. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.            We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.            Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.     We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the economy and /or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make their payments, additional allowances may be required.            Program Contract Costs.     We have agreements with distributors for the rights to television programming over contract periods which generally run from one to seven years. Contract payments    24           are made in installments over terms that are generally shorter than the contract period. Each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing. The portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.            The rights to program materials are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. Estimated net realizable values are based upon management's expectation of future advertising revenues net of sale commissions to be generated by the program material. Amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using either a four year accelerated method or based on usage, whichever yields the greater amortization for each program. Program contract costs, estimated by management to be amortized in the succeeding year, are classified as current assets. Payments of program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not affected by adjustments for amortization or estimated net realizable value. If we are unable to realize management's estimate of future advertising revenues, additional writedowns to net realizable value may be required.            Valuation of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets.     We periodically evaluate our goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows, market conditions, operational performance of our stations and legal factors. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long-lived assets and intangible assets is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.            Income Taxes.     We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results.    25                  Set forth below are the principal types of broadcast revenues received by our stations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution of each type to our total gross broadcast revenues:    NAME="dk1152_broadcast_revenue_(dollars_in_thousands)">      BROADCAST REVENUE   (dollars in thousands)                  Years ended December 31,          2002     2001     2000    Local/regional advertising     $  413,428     53.3%     $  391,872     54.3%     $  405,134     49.9%    National advertising        309,923     40.0%        307,514     42.7%        355,697     43.9%    Network compensation        16,450     2.1%        16,754     2.3%        17,656     2.2%    Political advertising        33,176     4.3%        2,559     0.4%        29,990     3.7%    Production        1,966     0.3%        2,069     0.3%        2,379     0.3%                                 Broadcast revenues        774,943     100.0%        720,768     100.0%        810,856     100.0%                                                Less: agency commissions        (104,409  )           (96,931  )           (111,434  )                                          Broadcast revenues, net        670,534              623,837              699,422          Barter revenues        60,911              53,889              54,595          Other revenues        4,344              6,925              4,494                                             Total revenues     $  735,789           $  684,651           $  758,511                                                        Our primary types of programming and their approximate percentages of 2002 net broadcast revenues were syndicated programming (51.5%), network programming (24.9%), news (13.8%), direct advertising programming (6.6%), sports programming (2.6%) and children's programming (0.6%). Similarly, our five largest categories of advertising and their approximate percentages of 2002 net time sales were automotive (23.2%), professional services (10.7%), fast food advertising (7.4%), retail department stores (6.7%), and paid programming (6.7%). No other advertising category accounted for more than 4.5% of our net time sales in 2002. No individual advertiser accounted for more than 2.7% of our consolidated net broadcast revenues in 2002.    26                 The following table sets forth certain of our operating data for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2002 was largely the result of the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $566.4 million net of taxes.            Net broadcast revenues increased to $670.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $623.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, or 7.5%. The year ending December 31, 2002 was positively impacted by higher advertising revenues generated from the political, automotive, services, restaurants, home products, schools, and beer/wine, offset by weakness in the fast food and soft drink sectors. During the year ended December 31, 2002, national revenues increased to $271.9 million, or 7.0%, from $254.0 million during 2001. National political revenues increased $19.1 million, or 1,888.0%. During the year ended December 31, 2002, local revenues increased to $369.0 million, or 8.3%, from $340.6 million during 2001. Local political revenues increased $6.9 million, or 556.0%, representing 2.0% of the increase in total local revenues. The increase in political revenues was primarily the result of the several primary and general elections during 2002.            National revenues, excluding political revenues, declined $1.3 million to $251.7 million, or 0.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2002 from $253.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. Local revenues, excluding political revenues, increased $21.5 million to $360.8 million, or 6.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2002 from $339.3 million during 2001.            Same station basis is a comparison of only the stations that we owned or provided programming and operating services pursuant to an LMA for both entire years ending December 31, 2002 and 2001. On a same station basis for the year ended December 31, 2002, national revenues including political revenues increased $17.2 million, or 6.8%, and local sales increased $29.4 million, or 8.8%, over 2001. The increase in national revenues was primarily due to the increase in political revenues. The increase in local revenues is related to our continued focus on developing a strong local sales force at each of our stations.             In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2001, the events of September 11 th  had a direct impact on the revenues of media related businesses. The impact of the terrorist attacks to us due to pre-emptions and cancelled advertisements was estimated to be a $5.4 million revenue loss during 2001.            The network affiliations that experienced the largest revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2002 were our NBC and CBS affiliates which increased 21.3% and 19.3%, respectively, compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. Our ABC and FOX affiliates experienced revenue growth of 11.3% and 9.1%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The WB affiliates' revenue increased 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The UPN affiliates' revenue decreased 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001.            Other revenue decreased to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 or 37.7%. The decrease in revenue relates to a decreased demand for services from our software development and consulting company, due to the slow economy and a decrease in revenue of $0.4 million related to the closing of the San Francisco office during the first quarter 2001.            Operating costs were $309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $311.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $2.2 million or 0.7%. The decrease in operating costs related to a decrease in program and production expenses due to the acquisition of    28           15 television broadcast licenses during the three months ended March 31, 2002, which we are able to operate at a lower cost than under the previous LMA structure. In addition, we reduced our spending for the February rating sweeps promotion due to direct competition from the Olympics. The decrease in operating expenses also resulted from the full quarter effect of our restructuring program initiated during the three months ended March 31, 2001, and the restructuring costs incurred during 2001, related to discontinued programming of local news at our stations KDNL-TV in St. Louis, Missouri and WXLV-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.            Depreciation and amortization decreased $74.6 million to $185.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $260.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 was related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 which resulted in the discontinuation of amortization of our goodwill and broadcast licenses, offset by an increase in amortization of our program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments related to our addition of new programming such as Dharma & Greg and Will & Grace as well as write downs related to additional seasons for Frasier, Drew Carey, Spin City, Just Shoot Me, and Third Rock from the Sun and an increase in depreciation of fixed assets related to our property additions, primarily resulting from our digital television conversion.            For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not incur any restructuring charges, impairment and write-down of long-lived assets (except for the impact of adopting SFAS No. 142) or contract termination costs. During the three months ended March 31, 2001, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to our eligible employees and implemented a restructuring program to reduce operating and overhead costs. As a result, we reduced our staff by 186 employees and incurred a restructuring charge of $2.3 million, which is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During September 2001, our station KDNL-TV in St. Louis, Missouri, discontinued programming its local news broadcast. As a result, we incurred a restructuring charge of $1.1 million. During December 2001, WXLV-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina discontinued programming its local news broadcast. As a result we incurred a restructuring charge of $0.3 million. The restructuring charges related to severance and operating contract termination costs. During the nine months ended September 2001, we incurred an impairment and write-down of long-lived assets of $5.5 million and contract termination costs.            Operating income increased $146.6 million to $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, or 385.8%. The net increase in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 which resulted in the discontinuation of amortization of our goodwill and FCC licenses offset by an increase in program contract amortization expense and property and equipment depreciation expense. Operating income was also affected by a decrease in program and production expenses due to the acquisition of 15 television broadcast licenses resulting in our ability to operate at a cost lower than operating those stations as LMA structures and reduced spending for sweeps promotion due to direct competition from the Olympics. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we incurred a loss of $16.1 million related to a write down charge of long-lived assets. This charge is comprised of goodwill related to our software development company and our station KBSI-TV in Paducah, Kentucky, and a write off of fixed assets which represent the net book value of damaged, obsolete or abandoned property. We also incurred contract termination costs of $5.1 million and restructuring charges of $3.7 million during the year ended December 2001. We did not incur any write-down charge of long-lived assets, contract termination or restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2002.             Interest expense decreased to $126.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $143.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, or 11.9%. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 resulted from the refinancing of indebtedness at lower interest rates    29           during December 2001, March 2002, July 2002, November 2002 and December 2002 and an overall lower interest rate environment.             Our income tax provision was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to an income tax benefit of $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Our tax rate changed to a provision in 2002 from a benefit in 2001 because we reported net income in 2002 compared to a net loss in 2001. The effective tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 26.2% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 31.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease is primarily because (prior to the implementation of SFAS No. 142 for 2002) our reported income in 2001 was reduced by amortization of goodwill, which was non-deductible for tax purposes.             Loss related to investments decreased to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The loss related to investments for the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily relates to a loss of $1.4 million as a result of a write down of our investment in Allegiance Capital, a loss of $0.1 million from the sale of our interest in Synergy Brands, Inc., offset by a gain of $0.3 million related to proceeds of a settlement to shareholders of Acrodyne.            We recognized income from discontinued operations of $7.9 million, which includes a gain on the sale of WTTV-TV in Indianapolis, Indiana of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001.            As a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 133, one of our derivatives does not qualify for special hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, this derivative must be recognized in the balance sheet at fair market value and the changes in fair market value are reflected in earnings. As a result, we recognized $30.9 million of losses during 2002.            Broadcast cash flow increased to $293.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $255.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, or 14.9%. The broadcast cash flow margin for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased to 43.8% from 41.0% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in broadcast cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily due to an increase in net broadcast revenue, a decrease in operating costs, offset by an increase in program contract payments.            Adjusted EBITDA increased to $273.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $235.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 or 16.1%. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 40.8% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 37.8% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and margins for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily resulted from an increase in net broadcast revenue and a decrease in operating costs offset by an increase in program contract payments.            After tax cash flow increased to $143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $91.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, or 57.4%. The increase in after tax cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, primarily resulted from an increase in net broadcast revenue, a decrease in operating costs, a decrease in interest expense, an increase in the current tax benefit offset by an increase in program contract amortization.     Years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000             Net loss available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $138.1 million or $1.64 per share compared to net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2000 of $67.0 million or $0.73 per share.            Net broadcast revenue decreased $75.6 million to $623.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $699.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, or 10.8%. The decrease in net    30           broadcast revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 was comprised of a decrease in revenues of $84.1 million on a same station basis offset by an increase of $8.5 million related to 2000 acquisitions, and the 2001 outsourcing agreement with WTXL-TV. On a same station basis, local revenue decreased $23.0 million and national revenue decreased $63.6 million, offset by an increase in other broadcast revenue of $4.0 million. Other broadcast revenue increased by $2.5 million related to an increase in tower rental revenue and an increase in syndicator revenue. Political revenues declined $23.7 million to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $26.0 million for the year ended December 30, 2000, or 91.2%, representing 1.5% of the decrease in local revenues and 4.6% of the decrease in national revenues. The decrease in political revenues was primarily the result of the Presidential election and numerous local elections during the 2000 period. The decrease in national and local revenues was primarily due to a soft advertising market resulting from a weak economy as well as increasing competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums, particularly network, cable television, direct satellite television, and Internet that have a direct impact on the distribution of advertising dollars in our markets. In addition, the events of September 11, 2001 had a direct impact on the revenues of media related businesses. The terrorist attacks led to the pre-emption and cancellation of advertisements, which caused a $5.4 million revenue loss during 2001.            Other revenue increased $2.4 million to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, or 53.3%. The increase was comprised of a general increase in Internet consulting and development revenue generated by G1440, which represents sales of $1.9 million and an increase in sales of $1.5 million due to the 2000 acquisition of a software design company, an increase in sales related to the "Builder" software product division offset by a decrease of $1.2 million related to the reorganization of the San Francisco office of G1440.            Total operating costs decreased $9.3 million to $311.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $320.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, or 2.9%. The decrease in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 was comprised of a decrease in programming and production expense of $6.4 million and a decrease in selling, general and administrative costs of $3.0 million. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs related to an increase of $1.9 million in general and administrative costs for G1440, $0.7 million for health insurance, and $0.9 million in bad debt, offset by a decrease in sales expense of $4.2 million, and a decrease in salaries of $2.5 million. On a same station basis, operating costs decreased by $10.5 million offset by an increase of $5.7 million related to 2000 acquisitions and our outsourcing agreement with WTXL-TV.            Depreciation and amortization increased $29.6 million to $260.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $230.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in depreciation and amortization related to fixed asset, intangible asset, and program contract additions associated with the 2000 acquisitions and program contract additions related to our investment in programming.            Interest expense decreased $8.6 million to $143.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $152.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, or 5.7%. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 primarily resulted from the reduction of our indebtedness using the proceeds from the disposition of our radio broadcast assets in December 2000 and, during 2001, an overall lower interest rate market environment, offset by an increase in interest expense related to capital leases. Subsidiary trust minority interest expense of $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 is related to the private placement of the $200 million aggregate liquidation value 11.625% high yield trust offered preferred securities (HYTOPS) completed March 12, 1997.    31                  Operating income decreased $117.9 million to $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $155.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The net decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net broadcast revenues, an increase in depreciation and amortization, an impairment and write down charge of $16.1 million, a restructuring charge of $2.3 million related to a reduction in our work force of 186 employees and a restructuring charge of $1.4 million related to the discontinuance of the news at our stations KDNL-TV, St. Louis, Missouri and WXLV-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and contract termination costs. These costs were offset by decreases in programming production costs as well as selling, general and administrative costs.            During June 2001, the San Francisco office of our Internet consulting and development subsidiary was reorganized. The office reduced staff due to a significant slow down of business activity in the San Francisco market. In addition, the focus of the San Francisco office has shifted toward marketing an existing product. As a result, management determined that the San Francisco office's goodwill was permanently impaired and, as such, recorded a charge to write-off goodwill in the amount of $2.8 million during June 2001. Also, during 2001, we wrote-off $4.2 million of fixed assets which represents the net book value of damaged, obsolete, or abandoned property. The impairment and write-down charge decreased operating income as noted above.            During February 2001, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to eligible employees and implemented a restructuring program to reduce operating and overhead costs. As a result, we reduced our staff by 186 employees and incurred a restructuring charge of $2.3 million which is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During September 2001, KDNL-TV in St. Louis, Missouri discontinued programming its local news broadcast. As a result, we incurred a restructuring charge of $1.1 million. During December 2001, WXLV-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina discontinued programming its local news broadcast. As a result, we incurred a restructuring charge of $0.3 million. The restructuring charges related to severance, operating contract termination costs, and legal costs. The restructuring charge decreased operating income for the year ended December 31, 2001.            During the third quarter of 2001, Sinclair terminated certain agreements and entered into new agreements with unrelated third parties. We incurred $5.1 million of contract termination costs, and we received $21.4 million for entering into a new contract. Both the amounts will be recognized as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts.            Loss related to investments decreased to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The loss related to investments for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily relates to a loss of $4.2 million recognized during 2001 as a result of our write-off of our loans to Acrodyne Communications, Inc. (Acrodyne), of which, as of December 31, 2001, we held approximately a 35% equity interest. We also recognized losses as a result of write-downs of our investments for How Stuff Works, Inc. of $0.9 million, Chatfish of $0.6 million and Synergy Brands, Inc. of $2.1 million. Our equity earnings for our investment in Allegiance Capital L.P. increased by $0.2 million.            We recognized a loss from discontinued operations of $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 related to the sale of WTTV-TV in Indianapolis, Indiana. Of the net income from discontinued operations, net of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2000, $2.0 million related to the sale of WTTV-TV, Indianapolis, Indiana and $4.9 million resulted from the disposition of our radio broadcast assets in December 1999 and during 2000.    32                  As a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 133, one of our derivatives does not qualify for special hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, this derivative must be recognized in the balance sheet at fair market value and the changes in fair market value are reflected in earnings. As a result, we recognized $32.2 million of losses during 2001.            Broadcast cash flow decreased $74.4 million to $255.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $329.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, or 22.6%. The broadcast cash flow margin for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased to 41.0% from 45.1% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in broadcast cash flow and margins for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 was comprised of an $78.0 million, or 23.6%, decrease in broadcast cash flow on a same station basis, offset by an increase of $1.6 million related to the 2000 acquisitions and a decrease in operating expenses.            Adjusted EBITDA represents broadcast cash flow less corporate expenses. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $71.8 million to $235.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $307.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, or 23.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 37.8% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 41.9% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA and margins for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 resulted primarily from the circumstances affecting broadcast cash flow margins as noted above combined with a $2.6 million decrease in corporate expenses.            After tax cash flow decreased $54.2 million to $91.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $145.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, or 37.3%. The decrease in after tax cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 primarily resulted from a decrease in net broadcast revenues, offset by an increase in current tax benefit and a decrease in interest expense.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), approved Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 141,    Business Combinations , and SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . SFAS No. 141 prospectively prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets including broadcast licenses effective January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 also establishes a new method of testing goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 resulted in discontinuation of amortization of our goodwill and broadcast licenses effective January 1, 2002; however, we were required to test goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment under the new standard during 2002.            During the three months ended March 31, 2002, we tested our broadcast licenses for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 based on the estimated fair value of such licenses in their respective markets. We estimated the fair values of our broadcast licenses using discontinued cash flow models. The estimated fair value was compared to the book value to determine whether any impairment had occurred. As a result of this analysis we incurred a pretax impairment charge of $64.0 million.            SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter, utilizing a two-step methodology. The initial step required us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill, of such unit. If the fair value exceeded the carrying value, no impairment loss was recognized. However, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the goodwill of this unit might have been impaired. The amount, if any, of the impairment would then be measured in the second step. The second step requires us to calculate the fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair    33           value of the reporting unit to each of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit based on their fair values. This calculated goodwill is then compared to the book value of the goodwill and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the book value exceeds the fair value.            We determined that our designated marketing areas (DMAs) were reporting units under SFAS 142. In connection with adopting this standard during 2002, we completed step one of the test for impairment by comparing the book value of our reporting units, including goodwill, to the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of January 1, 2002. We estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of quoted market prices, observed earnings multiples paid for comparable television stations and discounted cash flow models.            We performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test for those DMAs whose goodwill was found to be potentially impaired as a result of the first step. We performed the second step by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to each of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit based on their estimated fair values. We estimated the fair values of the assets and liabilities using a combination of observed prices paid for similar assets and liabilities, discounted cash flow models and appraisals.            As a result of such testing, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $532.8 million related to nine of our DMAs and our software development and consulting company. The total impairment charge of $596.8 million related to our broadcast licenses and goodwill is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our consolidated statement of operations, net of the related tax benefit of $30.3 million.            SFAS 142 requires goodwill and definite lived intangible assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis; therefore, we tested these assets for impairment as of October 1, 2002 by comparing their book values to their estimated fair values. There was no impairment charge recorded based on the results of such testing.            SFAS No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , as amended by SFAS No. 137,    Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesDeferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133,  and SFAS No. 138 , Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  requires that an entity recognize all derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet measured at their fair values. Changes in fair value of all derivative instruments and hedging activities are required to be recognized through earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We adopted SFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001.            In June 2001, the FASB approved SFAS No. 143,  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations . SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 and addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a material effect on our financial statements.            We adopted SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  on January 1, 2002. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 144, we classified the assets and liabilities of WTTV-TV as assets and liabilities held for sale on the balance sheet and reported the results of operations of WTTV-TV as discontinued operations on the accompanying statements of operations.            In April of 2002, the FASB approved SFAS No. 145,  Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections . SFAS No. 145 will require us to record gains and losses on extinguishment of debt as a component of income from continuing operations rather than as an extraordinary item and to reclassify such items for all periods presented. We adopted this provision of SFAS No. 145 on January 1, 2003. We do not expect the other provisions of SFAS No. 145 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.    34                  In June 2002, the FASB approved SFAS No. 146,  Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities . SFAS No. 146 is effective after December 31, 2002, and addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF issue No. 94-3,  Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.  The primary difference between SFAS No. 146 and EITF 94-3 concerns the timing of liability recognition and we do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have material effect on our consolidated financial statements.            In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Forces (EITF) reached a concensus on Issue 02-16,  Accounting by Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor , (EITF 02-16). EITF 02-16 requires us to treat our deferred commission credits as a reduction in selling expense when realized and not as broadcast revenue. We adopted EITF 02-16 on December 31, 2002. This adoption resulted in a reclassification of $3.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 2002 and 2001, respectively.            As of December 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transaction and Disclosure, an Amendment of FASB No. 123.  SFAS No. 148 revises the methods permitted by SFAS No. 123 of measuring compensation expense for stock-based employee compensation plans. We use the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Option No. 25, as permitted under SFAS No. 123. Therefore, this change did not have a material effect on our financial statements. SFAS No. 148 requires us to disclose pro forma information related to stock-based compensation, in accordance with SFAS No. 123, on a quarterly basis in addition to the current annual basis disclosure. We will report the pro forma information on an interim basis beginning with our March 31, 2003 Form 10-Q.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and availability under our 2002 Bank Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2002, we had $5.3 million in cash balances and working capital of approximately $88.5 million. We anticipate that cash flow from our operations and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations, dividend requirements, capital expenditure requirements and operating cash needs for the next year. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the required amount of funds for these items. As of February 14, 2003, the remaining balance available under the revolving credit facility was $173.0 million. Our ability to draw down our line of credit is based on pro forma trailing cash flow levels and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we had approximately $173.0 million available of current borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.            In March 2002, we completed an issuance of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8% Senior Subordinated Notes (the 2002 Notes), due 2012, generating net proceeds to us of $297.3 million. The gross proceeds of this offering were utilized to repay $300.0 million of the Term Loan Facility under our 1998 Bank Credit Agreement. We recognized an extraordinary loss of $0.7 million, net of a tax benefit of $0.4 million. The extraordinary loss represented a write-off of the deferred financing costs. Interest on the 2002 Notes is payable semiannually on March 15th and September 15th of each year beginning September 15, 2002. The 2002 Notes were issued under an indenture among SBG, its subsidiaries (the guarantors) and the trustee. Net costs associated with the offering totaled $3.4 million. These costs were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2002 Notes.            On July 15, 2002, we closed on a new Bank Credit Agreement (the 2002 Bank Credit Agreement), allowing us more operating capacity and liquidity. The proceeds of the 2002 Bank Credit Agreement were used to pay off the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement. The 2002 Bank Credit Agreement consists of a $225.0 million Revolving Credit Facility maturing on June 30, 2008 and a $375.0 million Term Loan B    35           Facility repayable in consecutive quarterly installments, amortizing 0.25% per quarter, commencing June 30, 2004 and continuing through its maturity on December 31, 2009. The applicable interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility is either LIBOR plus 1.25% to 2.25% or the alternative base rate plus 0.25% to 1.25% adjusted quarterly based on the ratio of total debt, net of cash, to four quarters' trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted in accordance with the 2002 Bank Credit Agreement. The applicable interest rate on the Term Loan B Facility is either LIBOR plus 2.25% or the alternative base rate plus 1.25%.            On November 8, 2002, the Company completed an add-on issuance of $125.0 million aggregate principal amount to the 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 at a premium of $0.6 million generating net proceeds of $125.8 million. We used the net proceeds together with available cash on hand and a draw down of $10.0 million on the revolving line of credit under the 2002 Bank Credit Agreement, to redeem our existing 9% Senior Subordinated Notes including an early redemption premium of $9.0 million and accrued interest of $7.2 million.            On December 31, 2002, we completed an add-on issuance of $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 at a premium of $3.8 million. We received net proceeds of approximately $130.4 million from the sale of the notes. We used the net proceeds together with additional funding from our term loan of $125 million, a draw down of $7.0 million on the revolving line of credit under the 2002 Bank Credit Agreement and available cash on hand of $0.2 million to redeem our existing 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007, including an early redemption premium of $10.9 million and costs associated with the offering totalling $1.7 million.            On April 19, 2002, we filed a $350.0 million universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission which will permit us to offer and sell various types of securities from time to time. Offered securities may include common stock, debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or any combination thereof in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when the securities are offered. If we determine it is in our best interest to offer any such securities, we intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the reduction or refinancing of debt or other obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and working capital.            The weighted average interest rates for outstanding indebtedness relating to our Bank Credit Agreement during 2001 and as of December 31, 2001 were 6.57% and 5.85%, respectively. The weighted average interest rates of our Bank Credit Agreement during 2002 and as of December 31, 2002 were 5.14% and 4.12%, respectively. During 2002, the interest expense relating to the Bank Credit Agreements was $27.9 million.            Net cash flows from operating activities increased to $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. We received income tax refunds net of payments of $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to income tax payments, net of refunds of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. We made interest payments on outstanding indebtedness and payments for subsidiary trust minority interest expense totaling $142.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $173.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Program rights payments increased to $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $102.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 or 3.9%. This increase in program rights payments was comprised of $8.7 million related to an increase in programming costs on a same station basis, offset by a decrease in payments related to the disposition of WTTV-TV. This increase in program rights payments resulted from our investment to upgrade our television programming.            Net cash flows from investing activities were $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to net cash flows used in investing activity of $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase in net cash flows used in investing activity was primarily due to the sale of WTTV broadcast assets and repayments of notes receivable, offset by payments relating to the    36           acquisition of broadcast assets, property and equipment expenditures and equity investments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we received proceeds of $124.5 million from the sale of WTTV-TV, we made cash payments of approximately $21.2 million related to the acquisition of television broadcast assets and received cash proceeds of $0.7 million related to the sale of broadcast assets. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we made equity investments of approximately $25.8 million. During 2002, we made payments for property and equipment of $62.9 million of which $49.6 million, related to digital conversion costs.            For 2003, we anticipate to incur approximately $92.0 million of capital expenditures, of which $50.0 million relates to the completion of our digital television roll-out, approximately $10.0 million for improvements and $32.0 milllion for the news expansion program. In addition, we anticipate that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business and additional strategic station acquisitions and equity investments if suitable investments can be identified on acceptable terms. We expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and funding from our Revolving Credit Facility.            Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased to $229.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from net cash flows from financing activities of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repaid $1.5 billion under the Term Loan Facility and utilized borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $1.3 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we received $21.8 million related to the termination of two of our derivative instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repaid a net $229.5 million of indebtedness, whereas in the comparable period in 2001, we borrowed a net $4.3 million, offset by repurchases of Class A common stock of $4.4 million and payment of an equity put option premium of $7.7 million during 2001.            We closed on the sale of four radio stations in Kansas City, Missouri in July 2000 for a purchase price of $126.6 million. In October 2000, we closed on the sale of our radio stations in the St. Louis market for a purchase price of $220.0 million and on the purchase of the stock of Grant Television, Inc., including the non-license assets of WNYO-TV in Buffalo, New York together with a $3.2 million note receivable issued by Sinclair that holds the license assets, for a purchase price of $48.0 million. In November 2000, we closed on the sale of our radio station in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania for a purchase price of $0.6 million. These transactions generated net after-tax proceeds of approximately $229.0 million.    Income Taxes             The income tax provision from continuing operations increased to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from a benefit of $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2002, our pre-tax book income from continuing operations was $5.2 million and for the year ended December 31, 2001, our pre-tax book loss from continuing operations was $165.3 million.             As of December 31, 2002, we have a net deferred tax liability of $167.2 million as compared to a net deferred tax liability of $155.5 million as of December 31, 2001. The increase is primarily due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Our tax rate changed to a provision in 2002 from a benefit in 2001 because we reported net income in 2002 compared to a net loss in 2001. The effective tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 26.2% from the year ended December 31, 2002 from 31.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease is primarily because (prior to the implementation of SFAS No. 142 for 2002) our reported income in 2001 was reduced by amortization of goodwill, which was non-deductible for tax purposes.            In December 2001, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of our federal income tax returns filed through 1997. As a result of this settlement, our fiscal year 2001 benefit for    37           income taxes reflects a $6.3 million reduction of taxes provided in prior periods. The IRS has initiated an examination of federal tax returns subsequent to 1998. We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for all years.     Seasonality/Cyclicality             Our results usually are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which usually cause fourth quarter operating income to be greater than first, second and third quarter operating income. This seasonality is primarily attributable to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season spending and an increase in viewership during this period. In addition, revenues from political advertising and the Olympics are higher in even numbered years.

(2) Future film liabilities reflect a license agreement for program material that is not yet available for its first showing or telecast. Per SFAS No. 63,    Financial Reporting for Broadcasters , an asset and a liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred under a license agreement are reported on the balance sheet when the cost of each program is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted by the licensee in accordance with the conditions of the license agreement and the program is available for its first showing or telecast. (3) Commitments to contribute capital to Allegiance Capital, LP and Sterling Ventures Partners, LP. (4) We have entered into an agreement with a third party, whereby the third party may require us to purchase certain license and non-license broadcast assets at the option of the third party, no earlier than July 1, 2005. The contractual commitment for 2006 and beyond represents the increase in purchase option price should the exercise occur in 2006 or 2007. (5) Certain LMAs require us to reimburse the licensee owner their operating costs. This amount will vary each month and, accordingly, these amounts were estimated through the date of LMA expiration based on historical cost experience.   38       NAME="page_do1152_1_39">        Risk Factors             We cannot identify nor can we control all circumstances that could occur in the future that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Some of the circumstances that may occur and may impair our business are described below. If any of the following circumstances were to occur, our business could be materially adversely affected.    United States participation in a war could result in a decline in advertising revenues.             Involvement in a war by the United States could cause television advertisers to reduce or cancel their advertising spots. Advertising revenues may decline as a result of uninterrupted news coverage or other economic dislocation. We cannot predict the amount of revenues that would be lost as a result.    Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our debt securities and HYTOPS.             We have a high level of debt and other obligations compared to stockholders' equity. Our obligations include the following:       Indebtedness under the Bank Credit Agreement.     As of February 14, 2003, we owed $552.0 million under our 2002 Bank Credit Agreement and had a $173.0 million remaining balance available.    Indebtedness under notes.     We have issued and outstanding two series of senior subordinated notes with aggregate principal amount issued and outstanding of $860.0 million.    Obligations under High Yield Trust Offered Preferred Securities (HYTOPS).     Sinclair Capital, a subsidiary trust of Sinclair, has issued $200.0 million aggregate liquidation amount of HYTOPS. "Aggregate liquidation amount" means the amount Sinclair Capital must pay to the holders when it redeems the HYTOPS or upon liquidation. Sinclair Capital must redeem the HYTOPS in 2009. We are indirectly liable for the HYTOPS obligations because we issued $206.2 million liquidation amount of series C preferred stock to KDSM, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, to support $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 11.625% notes that KDSM, Inc. issued to Sinclair Capital to support the HYTOPS.    Series D Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock.     We have issued 3,450,000 shares of series D convertible exchangeable preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $172.5 million. The liquidation preference means we would be required to pay the holders of series D convertible exchangeable preferred stock $172.5 million before we paid holders of common stock (or any other stock that is junior to the series D convertible exchangeable preferred stock) in any liquidation of Sinclair. We are not obligated to buy back or retire the series D convertible exchangeable preferred stock, but may do so at our option at a conversion rate of $22.8125 per share. In some circumstances, we may also exchange the series D convertible exchangeable preferred stock for 6% subordinated debentures due 2012 with an aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million.    Program Contracts Payable and Programming Commitments.     Total current and long-term program contracts payable at December 31, 2002 were $121.4 million and $124.7 million, respectively. In addition, we enter into commitments to purchase future programming. Under these commitments, we were obligated on December 31, 2002 to make future payments totaling $59.9 million.    Other.     Our commitments also include capital leases, operating leases, sports programming, personnel contracts and other liabilities. The amount of these commitments may be material.      39                      Our relatively high level of debt poses the following risks to you and to Sinclair, particularly in periods of declining revenues:       We use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends on preferred stock. This will limit the amount available for other purposes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we were required to pay $153.3 million in interest and preferred dividends (including dividend payments on the HYTOPS).  Our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for future working capital needs, additional acquisitions, or other purposes.  The interest rate under our bank credit agreement is a floating rate, and will increase if general interest rates increase. This will increase the portion of our cash flow that must be spent on interest payments.  We may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus less able to withstand competitive pressures.  Our ability to pay our obligations as they come due could become more difficult.  If our cash flow were inadequate to make interest and principal payments, we might have to refinance our indebtedness or sell one or more of our stations to reduce debt service obligations.             Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on us.    We depend on advertising revenue, which is below historical averages as a result of a number of conditions.             Our main source of revenue is sales of advertising time. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on:       the health of the economy in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole,  the popularity of our programming,  changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located,  pricing fluctuations in local and national advertising,  the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums, particularly network, cable television, direct satellite television, Internet and radio,  the decreased demand for political advertising in non-election years, and  other factors that may be beyond our control.     There was a dramatic decline in advertising revenue generally in 2001. Although advertising revenue generally increased in 2002 over 2001 levels, it still remains below levels prior to 2001. As a result of the foregoing factors, our advertising revenue has decreased significantly from levels prior to 2001.    Our flexibility is limited by promises we have made to our lenders.              Our existing financing agreements prevent us from taking certain actions and require us to meet certain tests. These restrictions and tests include the following:       restrictions on additional debt,    40             restrictions on our ability to pledge our assets as security for our indebtedness,  restrictions on payment of dividends, the repurchase of stock and other payments relating to capital stock,  restrictions on some sales of assets and the use of proceeds of asset sales,  restrictions on mergers and other acquisitions, satisfaction of conditions for acquisitions, and a limit on the total amount of acquisitions without consent of bank lenders,  restrictions on the type of businesses we and our subsidiaries may be in,  restrictions on the type and amounts of investments we and our subsidiaries may make, and  financial ratio and condition tests including the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as adjusted (adjusted EBITDA) to total interest expense, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to certain of our fixed expenses, and the ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA.             Future financing arrangements may contain additional restrictions and tests. These restrictions and tests may prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our securities, or may require actions that decrease the value of our securities. In addition, we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default on one or more of our obligations (particularly if the economy continues to soften and thereby reduces our advertising revenues). If we default on our obligations, creditors could require immediate payment of the obligations or foreclose on collateral. If this happened, we could be forced to sell assets or take other action that would reduce significantly the value of our securities.    Key officers and directors have financial interests that are different and sometimes opposite to those of Sinclair.             Some of our officers and directors own stock or partnership interests in businesses that engage in television broadcasting, do business with us, or otherwise do business that conflicts with our interests. David D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, and J. Duncan Smith are each an officer and director of Sinclair, and Robert E. Smith is a director of Sinclair. Together, the Smiths hold shares of our common stock that have a majority of the voting power. The Smiths own the television station WTTA-TV in St. Petersburg, Florida, which is programmed pursuant to an LMA with us. The Smiths also own businesses that lease real property and tower space to us, buy advertising time from us, and engage in other transactions with us. David D. Smith, our President and Chief Executive Officer has a controlling interest in and is a member of the Board of Directors of Summa Holdings, Ltd.; a company in which we hold a 17.5% equity interest and have significant influence by holding a board seat. In addition, Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation (formerly Glencairn, Ltd.) is a corporation owned by Carolyn C. Smith, the mother of the controlling stockholders and certain trusts established by Carolyn C. Smith for the benefit of her grandchildren (which own non-voting stock). Cunningham holds the licenses for certain television stations that we program under local marketing agreements. We have an option to acquire the equity interests in Cunningham for a price based on the purchase price of Cunningham's stations and have agreed that if we exercise the option, we would either pay any liability under Cunningham's bank credit agreement or take any equity interests subject to the security interest held by the lender under that agreement.            Maryland law and our financing agreements limit the extent to which our officers, directors and majority stockholders may transact business with us and pursue business opportunities that Sinclair might pursue. These limitations do not, however, prohibit all such transactions. Officers, directors and majority stockholders may therefore transact some business with us even when there is a conflict of interest.    41          The Smiths exercise control over all matters submitted to a stockholder vote, and may have interests that differ from yours.             David D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, J. Duncan Smith and Robert E. Smith control the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. The Smiths hold class B common stock, which generally has 10 votes per share. Our class A common stock has only one vote per share. Our other series of preferred stock generally do not have voting rights. We describe in detail the voting rights of shares of our capital stock in portions of Sinclair's proxy statement for the 2002 annual meeting of shareholders under the heading "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management". As of February 14, 2003, the Smiths held shares representing 89.4% of the vote on most matters and representing 49.2% of the vote on the few matters for which class B shares have only one vote per share. The Smiths have agreed with each other that until 2005 they will vote to elect each of them as a director of Sinclair.    Certain features of our capital structure may deter others from attempting to acquire Sinclair.              The control the Smiths have over stockholder votes may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us. In addition, our board of directors can issue additional shares of preferred stock with rights that might further discourage other companies from trying to acquire us. Anyone trying to acquire us would likely offer to pay more for shares of class A common stock than the amount those shares were trading for in market trades at the time of the offer. If the voting rights of the Smiths or the right to issue preferred stock discourage such takeover attempts, stockholders may be denied the opportunity to receive such a premium. The general level of prices for class A common stock might also be lower than it would be if these deterrents to takeovers did not exist.    We must purchase television programming in advance but cannot predict if a particular show will be popular enough to cover its cost. In addition, our business is subject to the popularity of the network we are affiliated with.             One of our most significant costs is television programming. If a particular program is not popular in relation to its costs, we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover the costs of the program. Since we purchase programming content from others rather than produce it ourselves, we also have little control over the costs of programming. We usually must purchase programming several years in advance, and may have to commit to purchase more than one year's worth of programming. Finally, we may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred, or accounted fully for the costs on our books for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. These factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market. Additionally, our business is subject to the popularity of the programs provided by the networks with which we have affiliation agreements or which provide us programming. Each of our affiliation groups experienced revenue increases in 2002, except for UPN affiliates, but this trend may not continue in the future.     We may lose a large amount of programming if a network terminates its affiliation with us.             The affiliation agreements of the three ABC stations (WEAR-TV in Pensacola, Florida, WCHS-TV in Charleston, West Virginia and WXLV-TV in Greensboro/Winston-Salem/Highpoint, North Carolina) have expired. In general, we continue to operate these stations as ABC affiliates and we do not believe ABC has any current plans to terminate the affiliation of any of these stations.            We have received a notice from NBC that prevented what would have otherwise been an automatic 5-year extension of the affiliation agreement for WICS/WICD (Champaign/Springfield, Illinois), which expired on June 30, 2002. Recently, we extended the term of the affiliation agreement for WICS/WICD to April 1, 2003. The agreement for WKEF (TV) (Dayton, Ohio), another NBC    42           affiliate, is also due to expire on April 1, 2003. We have no reason to believe that NBC has any current plans to terminate the affiliation agreements of either of these stations.            If we do not enter into affiliation agreements to replace the expired or expiring agreements, we may no longer be able to carry programming of the relevant network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and which may not be as attractive to our target audiences.    Competition from other broadcasters and other sources may cause our advertising sales to go down and/or our costs to go up.             We face intense competition in our industry and markets from the following:            New Technology and the Subdivision of Markets.     New technologies enable our competitors to tailor their programming for specific segments of the viewing public to a degree not possible before. As a result, the overall market share of broadcasters, including ourselves, whose approach or equipment may not permit such a discriminating approach is under new pressures. In addition, emerging technologies that allow viewers to digitally record and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials and, as a result, lower our advertising revenues. The new technologies and approaches include:       cable,  satellite-to-home distribution,  pay-per-view,  home video and entertainment systems, and  personal video recorders (PVR's).             Future Technology under Development.     Cable providers and direct broadcast satellite companies are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment. These so-called "video compression techniques" will reduce the cost of creating channels, and may lead to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets. Video compression is available to us as well, but competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues. Lowering the cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue.            In-Market Competition.     We also face more conventional competition from rivals that may be larger and have greater resources than we have. These include:       other local free over-the-air broadcast stations, and  other media, such as newspapers, periodicals, and cable systems.             Deregulation.     Changes in law have also increased competition. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and subsequent actions by the FCC have created greater flexibility and removed some limits on station ownership. Telephone, cable and some other companies are also free to provide video services in competition with us. In addition, the FCC has reallocated the spectrum occupied by television channels 52-59 for new services including fixed and mobile wireless services and digital broadcast services. Among the potential new uses envisioned by the FCC for this reallocated spectrum are digital broadcast services, based on coded orthogonal frequency division multiplex (COFDM) technology, including mobile television broadcasting services. As a result of these changes, new companies are able to enter our markets and compete with us.    43          The phased introduction of digital television will increase our operating costs and may expose us to increased competition.             DTV channels are generally located in the range of channels from channel 2 through channel 51. The FCC required that affiliates of ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC in the top 10 television markets begin digital broadcasting by May 1, 1999 and that affiliates of these networks in markets 11 through 30 begin digital broadcasting by November 1999. All other commercial stations were required to begin digital broadcasting by May 1, 2002.            Of the television stations that we own and operate, as of February 24, 2003, five are operating at their full DTV power and thirty-five are operating their DTV facilities at low power as permitted by the FCC pursuant to special temporary authority. Six stations have applications for digital construction permits pending before the FCC, including one of the stations which is operating at low power. Three stations have received extensions of their digital construction permits because equipment deliveries have delayed completion of construction and one station has recently received its DTV permit. Of the Cunningham stations we LMA, four stations are operating their DTV facilities at low power pursuant to special temporary authority, one station has a DTV construction permit that does not expire until November 2003, and one station has a pending DTV application. Of the other LMA stations, WTTA and WDBB are operating at low power pursuant to special temporary authority, WDKA has been granted special temporary authority to operate at low power. WFGX has received an extension of time to construct its digital facility pending FCC action on a petition for rulemaking that it filed requesting a substitute DTV channel, and WNYS has a digital application pending. On May 24, 2002, the FCC issued an Order and Notice of Proposed Rule Making which proposes a series of graduated sanctions to be imposed upon licensees who do not meet the FCC's DTV build-out schedule. If the rules are adopted, the stations could face monetary fines and possible loss of any digital construction permits that are not in compliance with the schedule announced in the rules. After completion of the transition period, the FCC will reclaim the non-digital channels.            The FCC's plan calls for the DTV transition period to end in the year December 31, 2006, at which time the FCC expects that television broadcasters will cease non-digital broadcasting and return one of their two channels to the government, allowing that spectrum to be recovered for other uses. During the transition period, each existing analog television station will be permitted to operate a second station that will broadcast using the digital standard. The FCC has been authorized by Congress to extend the 2006 deadline for reclamation of a television station's non-digital channel if, in any given case:       one or more television stations affiliated with ABC, CBS, NBC or FOX in a market is not broadcasting digitally, and the FCC determines that each such station has "exercised due diligence" in attempting to convert to digital broadcasting and satisfies the conditions for an extension of the FCC's applicable construction deadlines for DTV service in that market;  digital-to-analog converter technology is not generally available in such market; or  15% or more of the television households in such market do not subscribe to a multichannel video service (cable, wireless cable or direct-to-home broadcast satellite television) that carries at least one digital channel from each of the local stations in that market, and cannot receive digital signals using either a television receiver capable of receiving digital signals or a receiver equipped with a digital-to-analog converter.             On January 27, 2003, the FCC initiated its second periodic review of its rules on the conversion to digital television, releasing a notice of proposed rulemaking. The notice invited comments on the difficulties broadcasters face in building their DTV stations and on the interpretation of the statutory language concerning the 2006 deadline. There is considerable uncertainty about the final form of the    44           FCC digital regulations. Even so, we believe that these new developments may have the following effects on us:       Reclamation of analog channels.     Congress directed the FCC to begin auctioning analog channels 60-69 in 2001, even though the FCC is not to reclaim them until 2006. The channel 60-69 auction was scheduled to be held in January 2003 but has been delayed, and no new auction date has been established. Congress further permitted broadcasters to bid on the non-digital channels in cities with populations over 400,000. If the channels are owned by our competitors, they may exert increased competitive pressure on our operations. In addition, the FCC reallocated the spectrum band, currently comprising television channels 52-59, to permit both wireless services and certain new broadcast operations. The FCC completed an auction for part of this spectrum in September 2002 and has scheduled an auction for another portion of this spectrum in May 2003. With respect to the remaining spectrum, the FCC has not yet established an auction date. Analog broadcasters are required to cease operation on this spectrum by the end of 2006 unless the FCC extends the end of the digital transition. The FCC envisions that this band will be used for a variety of broadcast-type applications including two-way interactive services and services using COFDM technology. We cannot predict how the development of this spectrum will affect our television operations.    Signal Quality Issues.     Our tests have indicated that the digital standard mandated by the FCC, 8-level vestigial sideband ("8-VSB"), is currently unable to provide for reliable reception of a DTV signal through a simple indoor antenna. Absent improvements in DTV receivers, or an FCC ruling allowing us to use an alternative standard, continued reliance on the 8-VSB digital standard may not allow us to provide the same reception coverage with our digital signals as we can with our current analog signals. Furthermore, the FCC generally has made available much higher power allocations to digital stations that will replace stations on existing channels 2 through 13 than digital stations that will replace existing channels 14 through 69. The majority of our analog facilities operate between channels 14 through 69. This power disparity could put us at a disadvantage to our competitors that now operate on channels 2 through 13.    In August 2002, the FCC adopted regulations requiring new television receivers to include over-the-air DTV tuners. In November 2002, we filed a petition for further reconsideration requesting that the FCC ensure that these over-the-air DTV tuners are capable of adequately receiving digital television signals. If DTV tuners are not able to receive digital television signals adequately, we may be forced to rely on cable television or other alternative means of transmission to deliver our digital signals to all of the viewers we are able to reach with our current analog signals.    Digital must carry.     While the FCC ruled that cable companies are required to carry the signals of digital-only television stations, the agency has tentatively concluded, subject to additional inquiry in a pending rulemaking proceeding, that cable companies should not be required to carry both the analog and digital signals of stations during the transition period when stations will be broadcasting in both modes. If the FCC does not require this, cable customers in our broadcast markets may not receive our digital signal, which could negatively impact our stations.    Capital and operating costs.     We will incur costs to replace equipment in our stations in order to provide digital television. Some of our stations will also incur increased utilities costs as a result of converting to digital operations. We cannot be certain we will be able to increase revenues to offset these additional costs.    Subscription fees.     The FCC has determined to assess a fee in the amount of 5% of gross revenues on digital television subscription services. If we are unable to pass this cost through      45             to our subscribers, this fee will reduce our earnings from any digital television subscription services we implement in the future.    Conversion and programming costs.     We expect to incur approximately $150.0 million in costs of which we have incurred $98.0 million through December 31, 2002 to convert our stations from the current analog format to digital format. However, our costs may be higher than this estimate. In addition, we may incur additional costs to obtain programming for the additional channels made available by digital technology. Increased revenues from the additional channels may not make up for the conversion cost and additional programming expenses. Also, multiple channels programmed by other stations could increase competition in our markets.    Given this climate of market uncertainty and regulatory change, we cannot be sure what impact the FCC's actions might have on our plans and results in the area of digital television.       Federal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility.              The FCC regulates our business, just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting industry. We must ask the FCC's approval whenever we need a new license, seek to renew, or assign, or modify a license, purchase a new station, or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses and those of the stations we program pursuant to LMAs are critical to our operations; we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future, or approve new acquisitions.            Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and can be expected to continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may thereby affect our operating results.    The FCC's ownership restrictions limit our ability to operate multiple television stations, and changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets.             General limitations.     The FCC's ownership rules limit us from having "attributable interests" in television stations that reach more than 35% (using a calculation method specified by the FCC) of all television households in the U.S. We reach approximately 24% of U.S. television households on an actual basis or, under the FCC's current method for calculating this limit, approximately 14%. Our ability to expand through the acquisition of additional stations in new markets is limited by these rules. In September 2002, the FCC commenced a broad-based rulemaking proceeding to review all of its broadcast multiple ownership rules, including the 35% national ownership cap and the method to calculate a licensee's percentage reach of television households.            Changes in the rules on television ownership and local marketing agreements.     A number of television stations, including certain of our stations, have entered into what have commonly been referred to as local marketing agreements or LMAs. While these agreements may take varying forms, one typical type of LMA is a programming agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market, whereby the licensee of one station programs substantial portions of the broadcast day and sells advertising time during such program segments on the other licensee's station subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee. The licensee of the station which is being substantially programmed by another entity must maintain complete responsibility for and control over the programming, financing, personnel and operations of its broadcast station and is responsible for compliance with applicable FCC rules and policies.            In the past, a licensee could own one station and program and provide other services to another station pursuant to an LMA in the same market because LMAs were not considered attributable interests. However, under the duopoly rules adopted in August 1999, LMAs are attributable where a    46           licensee owns a television station and programs more than 15% of the weekly broadcast time of another television station in the same market. The rules provide that LMAs entered into on or after November 5, 1996 had until August 5, 2001 to come into compliance with the 1999 duopoly rules. LMAs entered into before November 5, 1996 are grandfathered until the conclusion of the FCC's 2004 biennial review. In certain cases, parties with grandfathered LMAs, may be able to rely on the circumstances at the time the LMA was entered into in advancing any proposal for co-ownership of the station. We currently program 11 television stations pursuant to LMAs. Of these 11 stations, three of the LMAs are not subject to divestiture because they involve stations which we could own under the 1999 duopoly rules, but either have decided not to acquire at this time or have no right to acquire, four LMAs (including an LMA with a station we have filed an application to acquire) were entered into before November 5, 1996, and four LMAs were entered into on or after November 5, 1996 (although we believe a valid position exists that one of these four LMAs was effectively entered into prior to November 5, 1996).            We filed a Petition for Review of the Report and Order adopting the 1999 duopoly rules in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In June 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted our motion for stay of the requirement that we divest the four LMAs entered into on or after November 5, 1996 by August 5, 2001, which stay is still pending. In April 2002, the Court held that the eight voices test of the duopoly rules was arbitrary and capricious and remanded the rules to the FCC for further consideration. In September 2002, the FCC commenced a broad-based rulemaking proceeding to review all of its broadcast multiple ownership rules, including the duopoly rules. The FCC has publicly stated that it intends to conclude this proceeding in the Spring of 2003.            Terminating or modifying our LMAs could affect our business in the following ways:       Losses on investments.     As part of our LMA arrangements, we own the non-license assets used by the stations with which we have LMAs. If our LMA arrangements are no longer permitted, we would be forced to sell these assets, or find another use for them. If LMAs are prohibited, the market for such assets may not be as good as when we purchased them and we would need to sell the assets to the owner or a purchaser of the related license assets. Therefore, we cannot be certain we will recoup our investments.    Termination penalties.     If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing LMAs before the terms of the LMAs expire or under certain circumstances we elect not to extend the term of the LMA's, we may be forced to pay termination penalties under the terms of some of our LMAs. Any such termination penalty could be material.               Outsourcing Agreements.     In addition to our LMAs and duopolies, we have entered into four (and intend to seek opportunities for additional) outsourcing agreements in which our stations provide or are provided various non-programming services such as sales, operational and managerial services to or by other stations.            Failure of Owner/Licensee to Exercise Control.     The FCC requires the owner/licensee of a station to maintain independent control over the programming and operations of the station. As a result, the owners/licensees of the stations with which we have LMAs or outsourcing agreements can exert control over their stations in ways that may be counter to our interests, including the right to preempt or terminate programming in certain instances.             These preemption and termination rights cause us some uncertainty that we will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased, and therefore uncertainty about the advertising revenues we will receive from such programming.            In addition, if the FCC determines that the owner/licensee is not exercising sufficient control, it may penalize the owner/licensee by a fine, revocation of the license for the station or a denial of the renewal of the license.    47                  Any one of these scenarios might affect our financial results, especially the revocation of or denial of renewal of a license. In addition, penalties might also affect our qualifications to hold FCC licenses, and thus place those licenses at risk.    We have lost money in three of the last five years, and may continue to do so indefinitely.             We have suffered net losses in three of the last five years. In 1999 and 2000, we reported earnings, but this was largely due to a gain on the sale of our radio stations. Our losses are due to a variety of cash and non-cash expenses including, in particular:             Cash Expenses:       Interest          Restructuring Costs:     During the year ended December 31, 2001, we incurred a restructuring charge of $3.7 million as a result of a voluntary early retirement program and cancelation of local news programs.            Non-cash Expenses:      Depreciation, amortization (primarily of programming and intangibles), and deferred compensation.            Impairment:      During the year ended December 31, 2001, we incurred impairment charges totaling $16.2 million due to reorganizing an office of our internet consulting and development subsidiary, damaged, obsolete or abandoned fixed assets and write-off of goodwill at one of our stations.                   During 2002 and under the provision of SFAS No. 142, we evaluated our intangible assets for impairment. As a result of such testing, we recorded a pre-tax write-off of goodwill and broadcast licenses of $596.8 million as of January 1, 2002.            Loss on Derivatives:      As a result of implementing SFAS No. 133, one of our derivatives does not qualify for special hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, this derivative must be recognized in the balance sheet at fair market value and the changes in fair market value are reflected in earnings or losses each quarter. We recognized $30.9 million of losses during the year ended December 31 2002.                        48                   Extraordinary Loss:      For the year ended December 31, 2002, we reported a $9.8 million extraordinary expense item related to the call premium and write-off of deferred financing costs and interest, net of taxes, resulting from the repayment of our $300.0 million Term Loan Facility and 1998 Bank Credit Agreement and the early redemption of our 9% senior subordinated notes due 2007 and our 8.75% senior subordinate notes due 2007.                   For the year ended December 31, 2001, we reported a $14.2 million extraordinary expense item related to the call premium and write-off of deferred financing costs and interest, net of taxes, resulting from the early redemption of our 10% senior subordinated notes due 2005, and amendments to our bank credit agreement.               Our net losses may continue indefinitely for these or other reasons.    Our investments in other businesses may not deliver the value we ascribe to them on our financial statements or reach our strategic objectives.             Our strategy includes investing in and working with other businesses, including technology and Internet-related businesses. In pursuit of this strategy, we made several investments in internet-related businesses in 1999 and 2000. The stock prices of publicly-traded technology and internet-related companies generally declined dramatically since 2000, and specific businesses we have invested in have experienced substantial impairment of their value. As a result, we have written-off a substantial portion of our investments in these businesses. These write-offs include all of our $10.1 million investment in Acrodyne Communications, Inc., a manufacturer of television transmitters and other broadcast equipment. We cannot assure you that these investments will be worth the amount we currently ascribe to them on our financial statements, or that we will be able to develop services that are profitable for Sinclair or the businesses in which we have invested. If the businesses in which we have invested fail to succeed, we may lose as much as all of our remaining investment in the businesses. We may also spend additional funds and devote additional resources to these businesses (we have recently invested an additional $1.0 million in Acrodyne), and these additional investments may also be lost.            In addition, we recently invested $20.0 million, representing approximately a 17.5% equity interest, in Summa Holdings, Ltd., a holding company that owns automobile dealerships, retail tire franchises and a leasing company, in which David D. Smith, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has a controlling interest and is on the Board of Directors. In contemplating the investment, we considered the historic and potential returns on equity. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Summa in committed to maintaining a certain amount of advertising with our stations. We will not be involved in the day-to-day management or operations of Summa, however, we will hold one board seat. There can be no assurances as to the future value of our investment in Summa. We may also invest additional funds and devote additional resouorces to Summa and these additional investments may also be lost.    49          NAME="do1152_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">      ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. To manage our exposure to changes in interest rates, we enter into interest rate derivative hedging agreements. Additionally, we have entered into put and call option derivative instruments relating to our class A common stock in order to hedge against the possible dilutive effects of employees exercising stock options pursuant to our stock option plans.    Interest Rate Risks             We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, which arises from the floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2002, we were obligated on $552.0 million of indebtedness carrying a floating interest rate. We enter into interest rate derivative agreements to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt.             As of December 31, 2002, we had one floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement, which expires on June 5, 2006. The swap agreement effectively sets fixed rates on our floating rate debt in the range of 5.95% to 7.00%. Floating interest rates are based upon the three month LIBOR, and the measurement and settlement is performed quarterly. Settlements of this agreement are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in the relevant periods. The notional amount related to this agreement was $575.0 million at December 31, 2002. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, we had two fixed-to-floating rate derivatives with notional amounts of $180.0 million and $120.0 million. At December 31, 2002, we had $552.0 million of floating rate debt all which was effectively converted to fixed rate debt by way of a swap. Additionally, we had $860.0 million of fixed rate debt at December 31, 2002 of which $300.0 million was converted to floating rate debt by way of a swap. Consequently, we had $300.0 million of floating rate debt at December 31, 2002 and a 1% increase in LIBOR rate would result in annualized interest expense of approximately $3.0 million.            We are also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred. As of December 31, 2002, we had senior subordinated notes totaling $310.0 million and $550.0 million expiring in the years 2011 and 2012, respectively. Based upon the quoted market price, the fair value of the notes was $907.3 million as of December 31, 2002. Generally, the fair market value of the notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall. We estimate that a 1% increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the notes by approximately $55.9 million as of December 31, 2002.            We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to one of our derivative instruments. Our $575.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133; therefore, changes in its fair market value are reflected currently in earnings as gain (loss) on derivative instruments. We incurred losses of $30.9 million and $34.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. We estimate that a 1% increase in interest rates would result in a gain of $20.9 million, while a 1% decrease would result in a loss of $21.7 million.
