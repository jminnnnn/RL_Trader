ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  INTRODUCTION       The Company is a diversified  broadcasting  company that  currently owns or programs pursuant to Local Marketing  Agreements ("LMAs") 35 television stations and, upon consummation of all pending acquisitions and dispositions, will own or program  pursuant to LMAs 56 television  stations.  The Company owns or programs pursuant  to LMAs  52  radio  stations  and  upon  consummation  of all  pending acquisitions and dispositions,  the Company will own or program pursuant to LMAs 51 radio stations.  The Company also has options to acquire two additional radio stations       The  operating  revenues of the Company are derived from local and national advertisers and, to a much lesser extent, from television network  compensation. The  Company's  primary  operating  expenses  involved in owning,  operating  or programming  the television  and radio  stations are  syndicated  program rights fees, commissions on revenues, employee salaries,  news-gathering and promotion. Amortization  and  depreciation of costs  associated with the acquisition of the stations and interest  carrying  charges are significant  factors in determining the Company's overall profitability.       Set forth below are the principal  types of broadcast  revenue  received by the Company's stations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution of each type to the Company's total gross broadcast revenue:                                  BROADCAST REVENUE                              (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                                                                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             1995                        1996                        1997                                   -------------------------   -------------------------   ------------------------              Local/regional advertising.....    $ 104,299         47.5%     $ 199,029         49.4%     $ 287,860        52.7% National advertising ..........      113,678         51.7        191,449         47.6        250,445        45.9 Network compensation ..........          442          0.2          3,907          1.0          5,479         1.0 Political advertising .........          197          0.1          6,972          1.7          1,189         0.2 Production ....................        1,115          0.5          1,142          0.3          1,239         0.2                                    ---------        -----      ---------        -----      ---------       ----- Broadcast revenue .............      219,731        100.0%       402,499        100.0%       546,212       100.0%                                                     =====                       =====                      ===== Less: agency commissions.......

The Company's  four  largest   categories  of  advertising  and  their   approximate percentages  of 1997 net  broadcast  revenue  were  automotive  (20.0%),  movies (6.7%),  fast food advertising  (6.4%) and  retail/department  stores (6.2%). No other  advertising  category  accounted  for more than 6% of the  Company's  net broadcast revenue in 1997. No individual  advertiser  accounted for more than 5% of any individual Company station's net broadcast revenue in 1997.                                          38           The following  table sets forth certain  operating  data of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997.

The  increase in net  broadcast  revenue for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1996 was comprised of $114.5 million related to television and radio station  acquisitions  and LMA transactions  consummated  during 1996 and 1997 (the  "Acquisitions")  and $10.2 million  that  resulted  from an  increase  in net  broadcast  revenue on a same station  basis.  Also on a same station  basis,  revenue from local and national advertisers  grew 7.7% and 4.9%,  respectively,  for a combined  growth  rate of 6.1%.       Total operating costs increased $55.7 million,  or 39.1%, to $198.3 million for the year ended  December  31,  1997 from  $142.6  million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  The increase in operating  costs for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 com-                                         39      prised $49.0 million related to the Acquisitions,  $5.4 million from an increase in corporate overhead  expenses,  and $1.3 million from an increase in operating costs  on a  same  station  basis.  On a same  station  basis,  operating  costs increased 1.8%.       Broadcast  operating  income increased to $126.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1997,  from $88.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996, or 42.1%.  The increase in broadcast  operating  income for the year ended December 31,  1997 as  compared  to the  year  ended  December  31,  1996  was  primarily attributable to the Acquisitions.       Interest expense increased to $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $84.3  million for the year ended  December  31, 1996,  or 16.7%.  The increase in  interest  expense for the year ended  December  31, 1997  primarily related to  indebtedness  incurred by the  Company to finance the  Acquisitions. Subsidiary  trust minority  interest expense of $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 is related to the  issuance of the HYTOPS which was  completed March 12, 1997.  Subsidiary trust minority interest expense was partially offset by reductions in interest  expense because a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the HYTOPS was used to reduce  indebtedness  under the Company's  Bank Credit Agreement.       Interest  and other  income  decreased  to $2.2  million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $3.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  This decrease was primarily due to lower average cash balances during these periods.       For the reasons  described  above, net loss for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $10.6 million or $.37 per share  compared to net income of $1.1 million or $.03 per share for the year ended December 31, 1996.       Broadcast Cash Flow increased  $54.2 million to $243.4 million for the year ended  December  31, 1997 from $189.2  million for the year ended  December  31, 1996,  or 28.6%.  The  increase in  Broadcast  Cash Flow was  comprised of $45.0 million  relating  to the  Acquisitions  and $9.2  million  that  resulted  from Broadcast  Cash Flow growth on a same station  basis,  which had Broadcast  Cash Flow growth of 8.2%. The Company's Broadcast Cash Flow Margin decreased to 51.7% for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from 54.6% for the year ended December 31, 1996. The decrease in Broadcast Cash Flow Margin for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily resulted from the lower margins related to the 1996 Acquisitions. In addition, 1996 Broadcast Cash Flow Margin  benefited from a  non-recurring  $4.7 million timing lag of program contract  payments  relating to the River City  Acquisition  and  certain  other acquisitions.  On a same station basis, Broadcast Cash Flow Margin improved from 57.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 to 58.9% for the year ended December 31, 1997.       Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  broadcast cash flow less corporate  expenses. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $180.3  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1996,  or 27.0%.  These increases in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 resulted from the  Acquisitions and to a lesser extent,  increases  in net  broadcast  revenues  on a same  station  basis.  The Company's  Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 48.6% for the year ended December 31,  1997 from 52.0% for the year ended  December  31,  1996.  This  decrease in Adjusted  EBITDA margin  resulted  primarily  from the  circumstances  affecting broadcast  cash  flow  margins  as noted  above  combined  with an  increase  in corporate  expenses.  Corporate overhead expenses increased to $14.4 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from $8.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996, or 61.8%.  These increases in corporate  expenses  primarily  resulted from costs  associated  with managing a larger base of operations.  During 1996, the  Company  increased  the size of its  corporate  staff  as a  result  of the addition of a radio business segment and a significant increase in the number of television  stations owned,  operated or programmed.  The costs  associated with this  increase in staff were only incurred  during a partial  period of the year ended December 31, 1996.       After Tax Cash Flow increased to $104.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, or 35.4%.  The increase in After Tax Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily resulted                                         40      from the Acquisitions, an increase in revenue on a same station basis, a Federal income tax  receivable of $10.6  million  resulting  from 1997 NOL  carry-backs, offset by interest  expense on the debt incurred to consummate the  Acquisitions and subsidiary trust minority  interest expense related to the private placement of the HYTOPS issued during March 1997.  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1996       Total revenue  increased to $378.5  million,  or 83.6%,  for the year ended December  31, 1996 from $206.1  million for the year ended  December  31,  1995. Excluding the effects of non-cash barter transactions, net broadcast revenue for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased by 84.4% over the year ended December 31,  1995.  The  increase  in  broadcast  revenue  was  primarily  the result of acquisitions and LMA transactions  consummated by the Company in 1995 (the "1995 Acquisitions") and 1996. For stations owned,  operated or programmed  throughout 1995 and  1996,  television  broadcast  revenue  grew  2.1%  for the year  ended December  31,  1996 when  compared  to the year ended  December  31,  1995.  For stations  owned,  operated or programmed  throughout  1994 and 1995,  television broadcast  revenue grew 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 1995 when compared to the year ended  December  31, 1994.  The  decrease in 1996 revenue  growth as compared to 1995 revenue growth primarily  resulted from the loss in 1996 of the Fox  affiliation  at  WTTO  in the  Birmingham  market,  the  loss  of  the  NBC affiliation  at WRDC in the  Raleigh/Durham  market and  decreases in ratings at WCGV and WNUV in the Milwaukee and Baltimore markets, respectively.       Operating  expenses  excluding  depreciation,  amortization  of  intangible assets  and  amortization  of  deferred   compensation  and  excess   syndicated programming  costs  increased to $167.8 million,  or 108.7%,  for the year ended December 31, 1996 from $80.4 million for the year ended  December 31, 1995.  The increase in  expenses  for the year ended  December  31, 1996 as compared to the year ended  December  31,  1995 was  largely  attributable  to  operating  costs associated  with  the  1995  and  1996  Acquisitions,  an  increase  in LMA fees resulting from LMA transactions and an increase in corporate overhead expenses.       Broadcast  operating  income  increased to $88.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996,  from $45.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1995, or 96.2%.  The increase in broadcast  operating  income for the year ended December 31,  1996 as  compared  to the  year  ended  December  31,  1995  was  primarily attributable to the 1995 and 1996 Acquisitions.       Interest expense increased to $84.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 from $39.3  million for the year ended  December 31, 1995,  or 114.5%.  The increase in interest  expense for the year ended December 31, 1996 was primarily related to senior bank indebtedness incurred by the Company to finance the River City Acquisition and other acquisitions.       Interest  and other  income  decreased  to $3.5  million for the year ended December  31, 1996 from $4.2 million for the year ended  December  31, 1995,  or 16.7%.  The decrease for the year ended  December 31, 1996 was  primarily due to lower cash balances and related  interest  income  resulting  from cash payments made in February 1996 when the Company made a $34.4 million payment  relating to the WSMH  acquisition  and April 1996 when the Company  made a $60 million  down payment relating to the River City Acquisition.  The decrease in interest income was  offset by an  increase  in other  income  resulting  from the 1995 and 1996 Acquisitions.       For the reasons described above, net income for the year ended December 31, 1996 was $1.1 million or $0.03 per share  compared to net income of $5.0 million or $0.15 per share for the year ended December 31, 1995 before the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt.       Broadcast cash flow increased to $189.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 from $111.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1995, or 70.3%. The increase in broadcast cash flow for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1995  primarily  resulted from the 1995 and 1996 Acquisitions.  For stations  owned,  operated or programmed  throughout 1995 and 1996,  broadcast  cash flow grew 1.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 when compared to the year ended  December 31, 1995. For stations  owned,  operated or programmed throughout 1994 and 1995, broadcast cash flow grew 23.7% for the year ended  December 31, 1995 when compared to the year ended  December 31, 1994. The decrease in 1996 broadcast cash flow growth as compared to 1995                                         41      broadcast cash flow growth  primarily  resulted from the loss in 1996 of the Fox affiliation at WTTO in the Birmingham market, the loss of the NBC affiliation at WRDC in the  Raleigh/Durham  market and decreases in ratings at WCGV and WNUV in the Milwaukee and Baltimore markets,  respectively. The Company's broadcast cash flow margin  decreased to 54.6% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 from 59.1% for the year ended  December 31,  1995.  Excluding  the effect of radio  station broadcast cash flow,  television station broadcast cash flow margin decreased to 56.7% for the year ended  December  31,  1996 as  compared to 59.1% for the year ended  December  31, 1995.  The decrease in broadcast  cash flow margins for the year ended  December  31, 1996 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1995 primarily  resulted  from the lower margins of the acquired  radio  broadcasting assets and lower  margins of certain of the acquired  television  stations.  For stations owned,  operated or programmed throughout 1996 and 1995, broadcast cash flow margins were unchanged when comparing the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995. The Company believes that margins of certain of the acquired stations will improve as operating and programming synergies are implemented.       Adjusted EBITDA increased to $180.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 from $105.8  million for the year ended  December 31, 1995,  or 70.4%.  The increase in Adjusted  EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1995 resulted from the 1995 and 1996  Acquisitions. The  Company's  Adjusted  EBITDA  margin  decreased  to 52.0% for the year ended December 31, 1996 from 56.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1995. The decrease in Adjusted  EBITDA  margins for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1995 primarily  resulted from higher operating costs at certain of the acquired stations.       After-tax  cash flow increased to $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 from $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1995, or 41.9%.  The increase in after-tax cash flow for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1995  primarily  resulted from the 1995 and 1996 Acquisitions offset by interest expense on the debt incurred to consummate these acquisitions.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       As of December 31, 1997,  the Company had $139.3  million in cash  balances and net working capital of approximately  $176.0 million.  The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and availability  under the 1997 Bank Credit  Agreement.  As of March 10, 1998,  the Company's cash balances decreased to  approximately  $10.1  million as a result of closing on certain of the  Heritage  television  stations.  Also as of March 10,  1998,  approximately $239.8 million was available for borrowing under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement. An  additional  $89.6  million is available to the Company  under its  Revolving Credit Commitment to the extent future acquisitions  provide incremental EBITDA. In addition,  the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement  provides for a Tranche C term loan in the amount of up to $400 million  which can be utilized  upon approval by the agent bank and upon raising sufficient commitments to fund the additional loans.       Net cash flows from operating activities increased to $96.6 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  The Company  made income tax  payments of $6.5 million for the year ended December  31, 1997 as compared to $6.8  million for the year ended  December 31, 1996. The Company made interest  payments on outstanding  indebtedness  of $98.5 million during the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to $82.8 million for the year ended  December 31,  1996.  Additional  interest  payments for the year ended  December  31,  1997 as  compared  to the year  ended  December  31,  1996 primarily  related to  additional  interest  costs on  indebtedness  incurred to finance  the 1996  Acquisitions.  The Company  made  subsidiary  trust  minority interest  expense payments of $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 related to the  issuance  of HYTOPS  completed  in March  1997.  Program  rights payments  increased to $51.1  million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, primarily as a result of the 1996 Acquisitions.       Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased to $219.0 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from $1.0 billion for the year ended  December 31,  1996.  During the year ended  December  31,  1997,  the  Company  made cash payments of $87.5 million to acquire the license and non-license assets of                                         42      KUPN-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada,  utilizing indebtedness under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement and existing cash  balances.  During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company incurred option extension  payments and other costs of $16.0 million relating to WSYX-TV in Columbus, Ohio. The Company made purchase option exercise payments of $11.1  million  during the year ended  December 31, 1997  exercising options to acquire certain FCC licenses  related to the River City  Acquisition. The Company made  payments for property and  equipment of $19.4  million for the year ended  December 31,  1997.  During the year ended  December  31, 1997,  the Company  made  deposits  and  incurred  other  costs  relating  to the  Heritage Acquisition,  the Max Media Acquisition and other acquisitions of $66.1 million, $12.8  million and $3.4  million,  respectively.  The Company  anticipates  that future requirements for capital  expenditures will include capital  expenditures incurred  during the  ordinary  course of  business  (which will  include  costs associated with the  implementation  of digital  television  technology) and the cost of additional  acquisitions  of television  and radio  stations if suitable acquisitions can be identified on acceptable terms.       Net cash flows provided by financing activities decreased to $259.4 million for the year ended  December  31,  1997 from  $832.8  million for the year ended December 31, 1996. In March 1997, the Company completed  issuance of the HYTOPS. The  Company  utilized  $135  million of the  approximately  $192.8  million net proceeds of the  issuance of the HYTOPS to repay  outstanding  debt and retained the remainder for general corporate purposes,  which included the acquisition of KUPN-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company made payments totaling $4.6 million to repurchase 186,000 shares of Class A Common Stock during the year ended December 31, 1997. In May 1997, the Company made payments of $4.7 million  related to the amendment of its 1996 Bank Credit Agreement.  In the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company negotiated the prepayment of syndicated program contract liabilities for excess syndicated  programming assets. In the first quarter of 1997, the Company made final cash payments of $1.4 million related to these negotiations.  In July 1997, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate  principal amount of 9% Senior Subordinated  Notes due 2007 and utilized  $162.5  million of the  approximately $195.6  million net proceeds to repay  outstanding  indebtedness,  retaining the remainder to pay a portion of the $63 million cash down payment  relating to the Heritage  Acquisition.  In December 1997,  the Company  completed an issuance of $250 million aggregate  principal amount of 8 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007.  The Company  received net proceeds from the issuance of $244.0 million of which $106.2 million was used to repurchase  $98.1 million  aggregate  principal amount of the 10% Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2003. The Company retained the remainder of the net  proceeds for general  corporate  purposes  which  included closing  the  acquisition  of  the  Heritage  television  stations  serving  the Mobile/Pensacola and Charleston/Huntington markets in January 1998.       The Company  received net proceeds from the 1997  Preferred  Stock Issuance and the 1997 Common Stock  Issuance of  approximately  $166.9 million and $151.0 million,  respectively.  The Company  used the  majority of these funds to repay existing borrowings under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement. Contemporaneously with the 1997  Preferred  Stock  Issuance  and the 1997 Common  Stock  Issuance,  the Company and the lenders  under the 1997 Bank Credit  Agreement  entered  into an amendment  to the 1997  Bank  Credit  Agreement,  the  effect  of  which  was to recharacterize  $275 million of indebtedness  from the Tranche A term loan under the 1997 Bank  Credit  Agreement  to amounts  owing under the  revolving  credit facility under the 1997 Bank Credit  Agreement.  The Company used $285.7 million of the net proceeds from the 1997 Common Stock  Issuance and the 1997  Preferred Stock  Issuance  to repay  outstanding  borrowings  under the  revolving  credit facility,  $8.9 million to repay  outstanding  amounts  under the Tranche A term loan and the remaining net proceeds of  approximately  $23.3 million for general corporate purposes.       The Company has entered into  agreements to acquire  additional  television stations  and  radio  stations  in  the  Heritage   Acquisition,   the  Lakeland Acquisition, the Max Media Acquisition and the Sullivan Acquisition. The Company also has an  option to  acquire  the  assets of  WSYX-TV,  Columbus,  Ohio.  The aggregate  cash  consideration  needed to complete the purchase of the remaining stations   under  the  Heritage   Acquisition   and  to  complete  the  Lakeland Acquisition,  the Max Media  Acquisition  and the  Sullivan  Acquisition  and to exercise the WSYX-TV option is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion (net of anticipated proceeds from sales of stations involved in these acquisitions).                                         43           The Company anticipates that funds from operations,  existing cash balances and  availability  of the revolving  credit  facility under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet its working  capital,  capital  expenditure commitments  (other than commitments for pending  acquisitions  described above) and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. The Company intends to finance  pending  acquisitions  through a combination of available cash, the net proceeds of the Offering,  and available  borrowings  under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement.  The current terms of the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement do not allow the Company  to  borrow  an  amount   sufficient  to  finance  all  of  the  pending acquisitions.  The  Company  intends  to begin  discussions  with  its  banks to refinance  the  Bank  Credit  Agreement  promptly  upon  the  completion  of the Offering.  The Company  believes that such a refinancing  can be accomplished on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such an amendment on satisfactory  terms. The 1997 Bank Credit  Agreement and the indentures  relating to the Company's 8 3/4% Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2007, 9% Senior  Subordinated Notes due 2007 and 10% Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2005  restrict the  incurrence of additional indebtedness  and  the  use  of  proceeds  of  an  equity  issuance,  but  these restrictions  are not expected to restrict the incurrence of indebtedness or use of proceeds of an equity issuance to finance the pending acquisitions.  INCOME TAXES       Income tax provision increased to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from a provision of $6.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996. The Company's effective tax rate increased to 139.1% for the year ended December 31, 1997 from 86.0% for the year ended  December 31,  1996.  The increase in the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily resulted from non-deductible goodwill amortization  resulting  from  certain 1995 and 1996 stock  acquisitions,  a tax liability  related to the  dividends  paid on the  Company's  Series C Preferred Stock  (see  Note  9,  sub-note  (a) to  the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial Statements),  and state franchise taxes which are not based upon pre-tax income. Management believes that pre-tax income and "earnings and profits" will increase in future years which result in a lower  effective tax rate and  utilization  of certain tax  deductions  related to  dividends  paid on the  Company's  Series C Preferred Stock.       As of December  31, 1997,  the Company has a net deferred tax  liability of $21.5 million as compared to a net deferred tax asset of $782,000 as of December 31,  1996.  This  change in deferred  taxes  primarily  relates to deferred  tax liabilities   associated  with  book  and  tax   differences   relating  to  the depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible  assets, a deferred tax  liability  generated  as a result  of a  reduction  in  basis  of  Series C Preferred  Stock  (see  Note  9,  sub-note  (a)  to the  Company's  Consolidated Financial Statements),  offset by deferred tax assets resulting from Federal and state net operating tax losses  (NOL's)  incurred  during 1997.  During the year ended  December 31, 1997, the Company  carried back certain  Federal NOL's to be applied  against prior years Federal taxes paid.  These Federal NOL  carry-backs resulted in an income tax receivable of $10.6 million as of December 31, 1997.       The Company's  income tax provision  increased to $6.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996 from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. The Company's  effective tax rate  increased to 86% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 from 51% for the year ended  December  31,  1995.  The increase for the year ended  December  31, 1996 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1995 primarily  related to certain  financial  reporting  and income tax  differences attributable  to certain 1995 and 1996  Acquisitions  (primarily  non-deductible goodwill resulting from stock acquisition),  and state franchise taxes which are independent of pre-tax income.       The net  deferred  tax asset  decreased to $782,000 as of December 31, 1996 from $21.0  million at December 31,  1995.  The  decrease in the  Company's  net deferred  tax asset as of December  31, 1996 as compared to December 31, 1995 is primarily due to the Company recording deferred tax liabilities of $18.1 million relating to the acquisition of all of the  outstanding  stock of Superior in May 1996,   adjustments   related  to  certain  1995  acquisitions,   and  resulting differences between the book and tax basis of the underlying assets.                                         44      SEASONALITY       The Company's results usually are subject to seasonal  fluctuations,  which result in fourth quarter broadcast operating income typically being greater than first,  second and third quarter broadcast operating income. This seasonality is primarily  attributable to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season  consumer  spending and an increase in viewership  during this period.  YEAR 2000       Certain  computer  programs  have been written using two digits rather than four  to  define  the  applicable  year,  which  could  result  in the  computer recognizing a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.  This, in turn,  could result in major system failures and in  miscalculations,  and is generally  referred  to as the "Year 2000"  problem.  The Company and all of its subsidiaries  have implemented  computer systems which run  substantially all of the  Company's  principal  data  processing  and  financial  reporting  software applications.  The  applications  software  used in these  systems are Year 2000 compliant.  Presently,  the Company does not believe  that Year 2000  compliance will result in any material  investments,  nor does the Company  anticipate that the Year 2000  problem  will  have  material  adverse  effects  an the  business operations or financial performance of the Company. In addition,  the Company is not aware of any Year 2000  problems  of its  customers,  suppliers  or  network affiliates that will have a material adverse effect on the business,  operations or financial  performance  of the Company.  There can be no assurance,  however, that the Year  2000  problem  will not  adversely  affect  the  Company  and its business.  ITEM 7A.
