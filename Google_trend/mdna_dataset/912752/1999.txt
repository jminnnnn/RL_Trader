ITEM  7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS   INTRODUCTION       As of December 31, 1998,  the Company  owned,  operated,  or  programmed 56 television  stations in 36 geographically  diverse markets and 51 radio stations in 10  geographically  diverse  markets  in the  United  States.  As of the date hereof, the Company owns, or provides  programming services pursuant to LMAs to, 57 television stations, has pending acquisitions of four television stations and has entered into an agreement to sell two television stations. The Company owns, or programs pursuant to LMAs to, 56 radio stations, two of which the Company has options to acquire and five of which the Company holds for sale.       The  operating  revenues of the Company are derived from local and national advertisers  and,  to a much  lesser  extent,  from  political  advertisers  and television network  compensation.  The Company's revenues from local advertisers have  continued to trend  upward and revenues  from  national  advertisers  have continued to trend  downward when  measured as a percentage  of total  broadcast revenue. The Company believes this trend is primarily resulting from an increase in the number of media outlets providing  national  advertisers a means by which to advertise  their goods and services.  The Company's  efforts to mitigate this trend  include  continuing  its  efforts  to  increase  local  revenues  and the development  of  innovative   marketing   strategies  to  sell  traditional  and non-traditional services to national advertisers.       The Company's primary operating  expenses involved in owning,  operating or programming  the television  and radio  stations are  syndicated  program rights fees, commissions on revenues, employee salaries, and news-gathering and station promotional  costs.  Amortization  and depreciation of costs associated with the acquisition  of the  stations  and  interest  carrying  charges are  significant factors in determining the Company's overall profitability.       Set forth below are the principal types of broadcast  revenues  received by the Company's stations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution of each type to the Company's total gross broadcast revenues:                                  BROADCAST REVENUE                             (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                                                                 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             1995                       1996                        1997                                   ------------------------   ------------------------   --------------------------              Local/regional advertising.....    $ 199,029        49.4%     $ 287,860        52.7%     $  418,100         53.8% National advertising ..........      191,449        47.6%       250,445        45.9%        316,547         40.7% Network compensation ..........        3,907         1.0%         5,479         1.0%         18,536          2.5% Political advertising .........        6,972         1.7%         1,189         0.2%         21,279          2.7% Production ....................        1,142         0.3%         1,239         0.2%          2,617          0.3%                                    ---------       -----      ---------       -----      ----------        ----- Broadcast revenues ............      402,499       100.0%       546,212       100.0%        777,079        100.0%                                                    =====                      =====                        ===== Less: agency commissions.......

Similarly,  the Company's four largest categories of advertising and their approximate percentages of 1998 net broadcast revenues were automotive  (20.0%),  fast food advertising  (7.3%), retail/department  stores  (6.6%) and  professional  services  (5.9%).  No other advertising  category  accounted for more than 5% of the Company's net broadcast revenues in 1998.  No  individual  advertiser  accounted for more than 2% of the Company's consolidated net broadcast revenues in 1998.                                          34        The following  table sets forth certain  operating  data of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998.

Net broadcast  revenue  increased  $201.6 million to $672.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $471.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997,  or 42.8%.  The  increase  in net  broadcast  revenue  for the year  ended December  31,  1998 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1997  comprised $194.3 million  related to businesses  acquired or disposed of by the Company in 1998 (the "1998 Transactions") and $7.3 million resulted from an increase in net broadcast  revenues on a same station  basis,  representing a 1.5% increase over prior year's net broadcast revenue for these stations.  On a same station basis, revenues were  negatively  impacted by a decrease in revenues in the  Baltimore, Milwaukee,  Norfolk and Raleigh markets.  The Company's  television  stations in these  markets  experienced  a decrease in ratings  which  resulted in a loss in revenues  and market  revenue  share.  In the  Raleigh  and  Norfolk  television markets,  the Company's  affiliation  agreements  with Fox expired on August 31, 1998 which further  contributed  to a decrease in ratings and  revenues.  In the Baltimore market, the addition of a new UPN affiliate competitor  contributed to a loss  in  ratings  and  market  revenue  share.  An  additional  factor  which negatively impacted station revenues for the year was the loss of General Motors advertising  revenues  caused by a strike of its employees.  These  decreases in revenue on a same station basis were offset by revenue  growth at certain of the Company's  other  television  and radio  stations  combined  with an increase in network compensation revenue and political advertising revenue.       Total  operating  costs  increased  $88.8 million to $287.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $198.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1997, or 44.8%.  The increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1997  comprised  $81.3  million related  to the 1998  Transactions,  $4.4  million  related  to an  increase  in corporate  overhead  expenses,  and  $3.1  million  related  to an  increase  in operating costs on a same station basis, representing a 1.8% increase over prior year's  operating costs for those stations.  The increase in corporate  overhead expenses  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998  primarily  resulted  from an increase  in legal fees and an  increase  in salary  costs  incurred to manage a larger base of operations.       Depreciation and amortization increased $47.7 million to $199.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $152.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase in depreciation and  amortization  related to fixed asset and intangible asset additions  associated with businesses  acquired during 1997 and 1998.       Broadcast  operating  income  increased $66.1 million to $192.4 million for the year  ended  December  31,  1998,  from  $126.3  million  for the year ended December 31, 1997, or 52.3%. The net increase in broadcast  operating income for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 was primarily attributable to the 1998 Transactions.       Interest  expense  increased  $40.6 million to $139.0  million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997, or 41.3%.  The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily  related to  indebtedness  incurred  by the  Company  to  finance  the Acquisitions.  Subsidiary  trust minority  interest expense of $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 is related to the private placement of the $200 million  aggregate  liquidation value 11 5/8% High Yield Trust Offered Preferred Securities  (the "HYTOPS")  completed March 12, 1997. The increase in subsidiary trust minority interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 related to the HYTOPS being  outstanding for a partial period during 1997.       Interest  and other  income  increased  to $6.7  million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $2.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  This increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances during these periods. However,  cash  balances  were lower at December  31, 1998 than at December  31, 1997.       Net loss for the year ended December 31, 1998 was $16.9 million or $.29 per share compared to net loss of $10.6 million or $.19 per share for the year ended December 31, 1997.  Net loss  increased for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended  December  31,  1997 due to an increase in  operating expenses,  depreciation and  amortization,  interest  expense,  subsidiary trust minority interest                                          36   expense,  the  recognition of an unrealized loss of $9.1 million on a derivative instrument and the recognition of an extraordinary loss offset by an increase in total  revenues,  a gain on the sale of  broadcast  assets  and an  increase  in interest and other income. The Company's extraordinary loss of $11.1 million net of a related tax benefit of $7.4  million  resulted  from the  write-off of debt acquisition costs associated with indebtedness  replaced by the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement.  As noted above,  the Company's net loss for the year ended  December 31, 1998  included  recognition  of a loss of $9.1 million on a treasury  option derivative  instrument.   Upon  execution  of  the  treasury  option  derivative instrument,  the Company  received a cash payment of $9.5 million.  The treasury option  derivative  instrument  will  require  the  Company to make five  annual payments equal to the difference  between 6.14% minus the interest rate yield on five-year  treasury  securities  on  September  30, 2000 times the $300  million notional amount of the instrument. If the yield on five-year treasuries is equal to or greater than 6.14% on September 30, 2000, the Company will not be required to make any  payment  under the terms of this  instrument.  If the rate is below 6.14% on that date, the Company will be required to make payments,  as described above,  and the size of the payment  will  increase as the rate goes down.  Each year,  the Company  recognizes  an expense  equal to the change in the projected liability under this arrangement based on interest rates at the end of the year. The loss  recognized in the year ended  December 31, 1998 reflects an adjustment of the Company's  liability under this instrument to the present value of future payments based on the two-year  forward  five-year  treasury rate as of December 31, 1998.  If the yield on five-year  treasuries  at September  30, 2000 were to equal the two year forward five year  treasury rate on December 31, 1998 (4.6%), Sinclair would be required to make five annual  payments of  approximately  $4.6 million each. If the yield on five-year  treasuries  declines further in periods before  September  30,  2000,  Sinclair  will be required to  recognize  further losses.  In any event,  Sinclair will not be required to make any payments until September 30, 2000.       Broadcast Cash Flow increased $106.7 million to $350.1 million for the year ended  December  31, 1998 from $243.4  million for the year ended  December  31, 1997,  or  43.8%.  The  increase  in  Broadcast  Cash Flow  related  to the 1998 Transactions and Broadcast Cash Flow on a same station basis remained relatively unchanged for the periods. The Company's Broadcast Cash Flow Margin increased to 52.0%  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998 from  51.7%  for the year  ended December 31, 1997. The increase in Broadcast Cash Flow Margin for the year ended December  31,  1998 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1997  primarily resulted from a lag in program  contract  payments for certain of the television broadcasting  assets acquired during 1998 of  approximately  $4.3 million and an increase  in  radio  broadcast  cash  flow  margins.  On a same  station  basis, Broadcast Cash Flow Margin  decreased from 51.8% for the year ended December 31, 1997 to 50.9% for the year ended  December 31, 1998.  This decrease in Broadcast Cash Flow Margin primarily  resulted from an increase in film payments  combined with a disproportionate increase in net broadcast revenue.       Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  broadcast cash flow less corporate  expenses. Adjusted  EBITDA  increased  $102.3 million to $331.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $229.0  million for the year ended  December 31, 1997, or 44.7%.  The increase in Adjusted  EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 resulted from the 1998 Transactions offset by a $4.4 million increase in corporate overhead  expenses,  as described above.  The Company's  Adjusted  EBITDA  margin  increased to 49.2% for the year ended  December 31, 1998 from 48.6% for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  This increase in Adjusted  EBITDA margin  resulted  primarily from the  circumstances affecting  broadcast  cash flow  margins as noted above offset by an increase in corporate expenses.       After Tax Cash Flow increased  $44.9 million to $149.8 million for the year ended  December  31, 1998 from $104.9  million for the year ended  December  31, 1997, or 42.8%.  The increase in After Tax Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 primarily resulted from a net increase in broadcast  operating income relating to the 1998  Transactions offset by an increase in interest expense and subsidiary trust minority interest expense relating to the HYTOPS.   YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1996.       Net broadcast  revenue  increased  $124.7 million to $471.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $346.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 or 36.0%. The increase in net broadcast                                          37   revenue  for the year ended  December  31,  1997 as  compared  to the year ended December 31, 1996  comprised  $114.5  million  related to  television  and radio station acquisitions and LMA transactions  consummated during 1996 and 1997 (the "1996 and 1997 Acquisitions") and $10.2 million resulted from an increase in net broadcast  revenues  on a same  station  basis.  Also on a same  station  basis, revenues from local and national  advertisers grew 7.7% and 4.9%,  respectively, for a combined growth rate of 6.1%.       Total  operating  costs  increased  $55.7 million to $198.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 or 39.1%.  The increase in operating  costs for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1996  comprised  $49.0  million related  to the  1996 and  1997  Acquisitions,  $5.4  million  resulted  from an increase in  corporate  overhead  expenses,  and $1.3 million  resulted  from an increase in  operating  costs on a same  station  basis.  Also on a same station basis, operating costs increased 1.8%.       Depreciation and amortization increased $31.1 million to $152.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $121.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase in depreciation and  amortization  related to fixed asset and intangible asset additions  associated with businesses  acquired during 1996 and 1997.       Broadcast  operating  income increased to $126.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1997,  from $88.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996, or 42.1%.  The increase in broadcast  operating  income for the year ended December 31,  1997 as  compared  to the  year  ended  December  31,  1996  was  primarily attributable to the 1996 and 1997 Acquisitions.       Interest expense increased to $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $84.3  million for the year ended  December  31, 1996,  or 16.7%.  The increase in  interest  expense for the year ended  December  31, 1997  primarily related to  indebtedness  incurred  by the  Company to finance the 1996 and 1997 Acquisitions.  Subsidiary  trust minority  interest expense of $18.6 million for the year ended  December  31, 1997 is related to the HYTOPS  offering  completed March 12, 1997.  Subsidiary trust minority interest expense was partially offset by reductions in interest  expense because a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the  HYTOPS was used to reduce  indebtedness  under the  Company's  1997 Bank Credit Agreement.       Interest  and other  income  decreased  to $2.2  million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $3.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  This decrease was primarily due to lower average cash balances during these periods.       Net loss for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $10.6 million or $.19 per share  compared  to net  income of $1.1  million  or $.02 per share for the year ended December 31, 1996. Net loss increased for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1996 due to an increase in operating expenses,  depreciation and  amortization,  interest  expense,  subsidiary trust minority   interest   expense  not  incurred  in  1996  and  recognition  of  an extraordinary  loss  offset  by an  increase  in total  broadcast  revenue.  The Company's  extraordinary  loss of $6.1  million  net of a related tax benefit of $4.0 million  resulted from the write-off of debt  acquisition  costs  resulting from the redemption of substantially all of the 1993 Notes.       Broadcast Cash Flow increased  $54.2 million to $243.4 million for the year ended  December  31, 1997 from $189.2  million for the year ended  December  31, 1996,  or 28.6%.  The increase in Broadcast  Cash Flow  comprised  $45.0 million relating  to the 1996 and 1997  Acquisitions  and  $9.2  million  resulted  from Broadcast  Cash Flow growth on a same station  basis,  which had Broadcast  Cash Flow growth of 8.2%. The Company's Broadcast Cash Flow Margin decreased to 51.7% for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from 54.6% for the year ended December 31, 1996. The decrease in Broadcast Cash Flow Margin for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily resulted from the lower margins related to the 1996 Acquisitions. In addition, 1996 Broadcast Cash Flow Margin  benefited from a  non-recurring  $4.7 million timing lag of program contract  payments  relating to the River City  Acquisition  and  certain  other acquisitions.  On a same station basis, Broadcast Cash Flow Margin improved from 57.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 to 58.9% for the year ended December 31, 1997.       Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  broadcast cash flow less corporate  expenses. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $180.3  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1996,  or 27.0%.  These increases in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31,                                          38   1997 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1996 resulted from the 1996 and 1997 Acquisitions and to a lesser extent, increases in net broadcast revenues on a same station basis.  The Company's  Adjusted EBITDA margin  decreased to 48.6% for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from 52.0% for the year ended December 31, 1996.  This  decrease in Adjusted  EBITDA  margin  resulted  primarily  from the circumstances affecting broadcast cash flow margins as noted above combined with an increase in corporate  expenses.  Corporate  overhead  expenses  increased to $14.4  million for the year ended  December  31, 1997 from $8.9  million for the year ended December 31, 1996, or 61.8%.  These  increases in corporate  expenses primarily   result  from  costs  associated  with  managing  a  larger  base  of operations.  During 1996, the Company  increased the size of its corporate staff as a result  of the  addition  of a radio  business  segment  and a  significant increase in the number of television stations owned, operated or programmed. The costs associated with this increase in staff were only incurred during a partial period of the year ended December 31, 1996.       After Tax Cash Flow increased to $104.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, or 35.4%.  The increase in After Tax Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1996  primarily  resulted from the 1996 and 1997 Acquisitions,  an increase in revenues on a same station basis, a Federal income tax receivable of $10.6 million  resulting from 1997 NOL carry-backs,  offset by interest  expense  on  the  debt  incurred  to  consummate  the  1996  and  1997 Acquisitions  and subsidiary  trust  minority  interest  expense  related to the private placement of the HYTOPS issued during March 1997.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       The Company's  primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and availability under the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement.  As of December 31, 1998, the  Company  had $3.3  million  in cash  balances  and net  working  capital of approximately $55.8 million.  The Company's net decrease in cash to $3.3 million at December 31, 1998 from $139.3 million at December 31, 1997 primarily resulted from the 1998  Transactions.  As of December 31,  1998,  the  remaining  balance available under the Revolving  Credit Facility was $197.0 million.  Based on pro forma  trailing cash flow levels for the twelve months ended  December 31, 1998, the Company had  approximately  $75.2  million  available  of current  borrowing capacity under the Revolving  Credit  Facility.  The 1998 Bank Credit  Agreement also  provides for an  incremental  term loan  commitment in the amount of up to $400  million  which can be  utilized  upon  approval  by the Agent bank and the raising of sufficient commitments from banks to fund the additional loans.       The Company has current  acquisition  commitments of  approximately  $122.0 million net of proceeds  totaling  $242.0 million  anticipated  from the sale of television  stations  related  to  the  Ackerley   Disposition,   the  1999  STC Disposition and the CCA Disposition (collectively,  the "Pending Transactions"). In order to complete the Pending  Transactions during the second quarter of 1999 and also remain in compliance  with certain of its debt  covenants,  the Company estimates  that  it  would  be  required  to  generate   proceeds  from  station dispositions of approximately  $30 million or alternatively  raise proceeds from common or preferred stock securities issuances of approximately $15 million. The Company  announced in the fourth  quarter of 1998 that it intended to enter into agreements to sell  selected  television  and radio  stations not central to its business strategy. As of March 22, 1999, the Company has entered into agreements to sell stations for aggregate  consideration of approximately  $140 million and was  actively  planning to sell an  additional  $35 million in  properties.  The Company intends to evaluate whether further  divestitures are appropriate  after completing  these sales.  The Company's  other primary  sources of liquidity are cash  provided  by  operations  and  availability  under  the 1998  Bank  Credit Agreement.        The Company anticipates that funds from operations, existing cash balances, the  availability  of the Revolving  Credit  Facility under the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement and the proceeds from the sale of certain  stations will be sufficient to meet its working  capital,  capital  expenditure  commitments,  debt  service requirements and current acquisition commitments.       Net cash flows from  operating  activities  increased to $150.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 from $96.6 million for the year ended December 31,  1997.  The Company  made income tax  payments of $3.6  million for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to $6.5 million for the year ended                                          39   December  31,  1997.   The  Company  made  interest   payments  on   outstanding indebtedness  and payments for subsidiary  minority  interest  expense  totaling $140.9  million  during the year ended  December  31, 1998 as compared to $116.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  Additional  interest payments for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 primarily  related to  additional  interest  costs on  indebtedness  incurred to finance  businesses  acquired during 1998.  Program rights payments increased to $64.3  million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 from $51.1  million for the year ended December 31, 1997. This increase in program rights payments comprised $8.8 million  related to the 1998  Transactions  and $4.4 million  related to an increase in programming costs on a same station basis, which increased 8.7%.       Net cash flows used in investing  activities  increased to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $219.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  For the year ended  December 31, 1998, the Company made cash payments of approximately $2.1 billion related to the acquisition of television and radio broadcast assets primarily by utilizing  available  indebtedness  under the 1998 Bank Credit  Agreement.  These payments  included  $232.9 million related to the WSYX  Acquisition,  $53.0 million  related to the Lakeland  Acquisition,  $571.3 million  related to the  Heritage  Acquisition,  $951.0  million  related to the Sullivan  Acquisition,  $239.4 million related to the Max Media  Acquisition and $10.4 million  related to other  acquisitions.  For the year ended  December 31, 1998, the Company received approximately $273.3 million of cash proceeds related to the sale of certain television and radio broadcast assets which was primarily utilized to repay indebtedness under the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement.  These cash proceeds  included  $126.9 million  related to the Entercom  Disposition,  $72.0 million  related  to the  STC  Disposition,  $35.0  million  related  to the SFX Disposition, $21.0 million related to the Radio Unica Disposition, $16.1 million related to the Centennial  Disposition  and $2.3 million  related to the sale of other broadcast  assets.  For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company made cash payments  related to the Buffalo  Acquisition of $3.3 million and made cash payments of $6.9 million for  deposits  and other costs  related to other future acquisitions.  During  1998,  the Company  made equity  investments  in Acrodyne Communications,  Inc. and USA Digital Radio, Inc. of approximately  $7.1 million and $1.5  million,  respectively.  The Company  made  payments  for property and equipment of $19.4  million for the year ended  December  31, 1998.  The Company expects that  expenditures for property and equipment will increase for the year ended  December 31, 1999 as a result of a larger number of stations owned by the Company.  In addition,  the Company  anticipates  that future  requirements  for capital  expenditures  will include  capital  expenditures  incurred  during the ordinary course of business and additional  strategic  station  acquisitions and equity  investments  if suitable  investments  can be  identified  on acceptable terms.       Net cash flows provided by financing  activities  increased to $1.5 billion for the year ended  December  31,  1998 from  $259.4  million for the year ended December 31,  1997.  In April 1998,  the Company and certain  Series B Preferred stockholders  of the Company  completed  a public  offering  of  12,000,000  and 4,060,374 shares, respectively of Class A Common Stock. The shares were sold for an offering price of $29.125 per share and generated  proceeds to the Company of $335.1  million,  net of  underwriters'  discount  and other  offering  costs of approximately $14.4 million. The Company utilized proceeds to repay indebtedness under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement.  In May 1998, the Company entered into the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement in order to expand its borrowing  capacity for future acquisitions  and obtain more  favorable  terms with its banks. A portion of the proceeds of the initial  borrowing under the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement was used to repay all outstanding indebtedness related to the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement. In addition,  during September 1998, the Company repurchased 1,505,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock for an aggregate  purchase price of $26.7  million,  an average share price of $17.72. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company also made option  premium  payments of $14.0  million  related to equity put and call options entered into during 1998.   INCOME TAXES       The income tax  provision  increased  to $45.7  million  for the year ended December 31, 1998 from a provision of $16.0 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  The  Company's  effective  tax rate  decreased to 114.6% for the year ended  December 31, 1998 from 139.1% for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  The decrease in the  Company's  effective  tax rate for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997  primarily  resulted from a decrease in the deferred tax                                          40   liability  associated  with dividends  paid on the Company's  Series C Preferred Stock  (see  Note  8,  sub-note  (a) to  the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial Statements).  Management believes that pre-tax income and "earnings and profits" will increase in future years which will further result in a lower effective tax rate and utilization of certain tax deductions  related to dividends paid on the Company's Series C Preferred Stock.       As of December  31, 1998,  the Company has a net deferred tax  liability of $165.5  million as compared to a net deferred tax  liability of $21.5 million as of December 31, 1997.  During 1998,  the Company  acquired the stock of Sullivan Broadcast Holdings, Inc. (Sullivan),  Lakeland Group Television, Inc. (Lakeland) and the direct and indirect  interests of Max Media  Properties LLC (Max Media). The Company recorded net deferred tax liabilities resulting from these purchases of approximately  $114.0 million.  These net deferred tax liabilities  primarily relate to the permanent differences between financial reporting carrying amounts and tax basis amounts measured upon the purchase date.       The income tax  provision  increased  to $16.0  million  for the year ended December 31, 1997 from a provision  of $6.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  The  Company's  effective  tax rate  increased to 139.1% for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from 86.0% for the year ended  December  31, 1996.  The increase in the  Company's  effective  tax rate for the year ended  December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1996  primarily  resulted  from non-deductible  goodwill amortization resulting from certain 1995 and 1996 stock acquisitions,  a tax liability  related to the  dividends  paid on the Company's Series C Preferred Stock (see Note 8, sub-note (a) to the Company's Consolidated Financial  Statements),  and state  franchise  taxes  which  are not based  upon pre-tax  income.  During the year ended December 31, 1997,  the Company  carried back certain Federal NOL's to be applied against prior years Federal taxes paid. These Federal NOL  carry-backs  resulted in a Federal  income tax refund of $9.3 million during 1998.   SEASONALITY       The Company's results usually are subject to seasonal  fluctuations,  which result in fourth quarter  broadcast  operating income being greater usually than first,  second and third quarter broadcast operating income. This seasonality is primarily  attributable to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season spending and an increase in viewership  during this period. In addition, revenues from political advertising tend to be higher in even numbered years.   YEAR 2000       The Company has  commenced a process to assure Year 2000  compliance of all hardware,  software,  broadcast  equipment and ancillary equipment that are date dependent.  The process  involves  four  phases:  Phase I -  Inventory  and Data Collection.  This phase  involves an  identification  of all items that are date dependent.  Sinclair  commenced  this phase in the third  quarter  of 1998,  and Management estimates it has completed  approximately 50% of this phase as of the date hereof. The Company expects to complete this phase by the end of the second quarter of 1999.       Phase II - Compliance Requests. This phase involves requests to information technology systems vendors for verification that the systems identified in Phase I are Year 2000  compliant.  Sinclair  will  identify and begin to replace items that cannot be updated or certified as  compliant.  Sinclair has  completed  the compliance  request  phase  of its  plan as of the  date  hereof.  In  addition, Sinclair has verified that its accounting,  traffic, payroll, and local and wide area network hardware and software systems are compliant. In addition,  Sinclair is currently in the process of ascertaining  that all of its personal  computers and PC applications are compliant. Sinclair is currently reviewing its news-room systems,  building  control systems,  security  systems and other  miscellaneous systems.  The Company  expects to  complete  this phase by the end of the second quarter of 1999.       Phase III - Test,  Fix and Verify.  This phase  involves  testing all items that are date  dependent  and  upgrading  all  non-compliant  devices.  Sinclair expects to complete  this phase during the first,  second and third  quarters of 1999.                                          41        Phase IV - Final Testing,  New Item Compliance.  This phase involves review of all inventories for compliance and retesting as necessary. During this phase, all new equipment will be tested for  compliance.  Sinclair  expects to complete this phase by the end of the third quarter of 1999.       The Company has developed a contingency/emergency plan to address Year 2000 worst case  scenarios.  The  contingency  plan includes,  but is not limited to, addressing  (i)  regional  power  facilities,  (ii)  interruption  of  satellite delivered  programming,  (iii) replacement or repair of equipment not discovered or fixed  during  the year  2000  compliance  process  and (iv)  local  security measures that may become  necessary  relating to the Company's  properties.  The contingency plan involves obtaining  alternative  sources if existing sources of these goods and services are not  available.  Although the  contingency  plan is designed to reduce the impact of  disruptions  from these  sources,  there is no assurance that the plan will avoid material disruptions in the event one or more of these events occurs.       To date,  Sinclair believes that its major systems are Year 2000 compliant. This  substantial  compliance has been achieved  without the need to acquire new hardware,  software or systems  other than in the  ordinary  course of replacing such systems. Sinclair is not aware of any non-compliance that would be material to repair or replace or that would have a material effect on Sinclair's business if compliance were not achieved.  Sinclair does not believe that  non-compliance in any systems that have not yet been reviewed would result in material costs or disruption.  Neither is Sinclair aware of any non-compliance by its customers or suppliers   that  would  have  a  material   impact  on   Sinclair's   business. Nevertheless,  there can be no assurance that unanticipated  non-compliance will not occur,  and such  non-compliance  could require  material costs to repair or could cause material disruptions if not repaired.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company is exposed to market risk from  changes in interest  rates.  To manage its  exposure  to changes in  interest  rates,  the  Company  enters into interest rate  derivative  hedging  agreements.  The Company has entered into an additional  derivative  instrument to monetize the benefit of a call option on a portion of its outstanding indebtedness at interest rates prevailing at the time the  Company  entered  into the  instrument.  This  derivative  instrument  (the "Treasury Option Derivative Instrument") exposes the Company to market risk from a further decrease in interest rates, but the Company believes that this risk is offset by the benefit to the Company  from  reduced  interest  rate expense on a portion  of its  floating  rate  debt  and  the  ability  to  call  some  of its indebtedness and replace it with debt at the lower prevailing interest rates.       Finally, the Company has entered put and call option derivative instruments relating to the  Company's  Class A Common  Stock in order to hedge  against the possible dilutive effects of employees  exercising stock options pursuant to the Company's stock option plans.       The Company  does not enter into  derivative  instruments  for  speculative trading purposes. With the exception of the Company's Treasury Option Derivative Instrument  (described  below), the Company does not reflect the changes in fair market value related to derivative  instruments  in the  accompanying  financial statements.   INTEREST RATE RISKS       The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, which arises from its floating  rate debt.  As of December  31, 1998,  the Company was obligated on $1.6 billion of indebtedness carrying a floating interest rate. The Company enters into interest rate derivative  agreements to reduce the impact of changing  interest  rates  on its  floating  rate  debt.  The 1998  Bank  Credit Agreement, as amended and restated,  requires the Company to enter into Interest Rate Protection Agreements at rates not to exceed 10% per annum as to a notional principal  amount  at  least  equal to 60% of the Term  Loan,  Revolving  Credit Facility and Senior  Subordinated Notes scheduled to be outstanding from time to time.       As of  December  31,  1998,  the Company  had  several  interest  rate swap agreements  which expire from July 7, 1999 to July 15, 2007. The swap agreements effectively set fixed rates on the Company's  floating rate debt in the range of 5.5% to 8.1%.  Floating  interest  rates are based upon the three  month  London Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR)  rate,  and the  measurement  and  settlement is performed quarterly.                                          42   Settlements of these  agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in the relevant  periods.  The notional amounts related to these agreements were $1.1  billion at December 31,  1998,  and  decrease to $200 million  through the expiration   dates.  In  addition,   the  Company  entered  into  floating  rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling $200 million.  Based on the Company's currently  hedged  position,  $1.7 billion or 73% of the  Company's  outstanding indebtedness is hedged.       Based on the Company's debt levels and the amount of floating rate debt not hedged as of December  31, 1998, a 1% increase in the LIBOR rate would result in an increase in annualized interest expense of approximately $10.5 million.   TREASURY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT       In August  1998,  the Company  entered  into a treasury  option  derivative contract (the "Option Derivative").  The Option Derivative contract provides for 1) an option  exercise date of September 30, 2000, 2) a notional  amount of $300 million and 3) a five-year  treasury  strike rate of 6.14%. If the interest rate yield on five  year  treasury  securities  is less than the  strike  rate on the option  exercise  date,  the Company would be obligated to pay five  consecutive annual  payments  in an  amount  equal to the  strike  rate  less the five  year treasury rate  multiplied by the notional  amount  beginning  September 30, 2001 through  September  30, 2006.  If the interest  rate yield on five year treasury securities  is greater  than the strike rate on the option  exercise  date,  the Company would not be obligated to make any payments.       Upon the execution of the Option Derivative contract,  the Company received a cash payment representing an option premium of $9.5 million which was recorded in "Other long-term liabilities" in the accompanying balance sheets. The Company is required to  periodically  adjust its  liability to the present  value of the future  payments  of the  settlement  amounts  based on the  forward  five  year treasury  rate  at the  end of an  accounting  period.  The  fair  market  value adjustment for 1998 resulted in an income statement charge  (unrealized loss) of $9.1 million for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  If the yield on five year treasuries  at  September  30, 2000 were to equal the two year forward five year treasury  rate on December 31, 1998 (4.6%),  Sinclair  would be required to make five  annual  payments  of  approximately  $4.6  million  each.  If the yield on five-year  treasuries  at September  30, 2000  decreased by 1% from the two-year forward  five-year rate of December 31, 1998 (i.e., to 3.6%) then Sinclair would be required to make five annual payments of approximately $7.6 million each.       The Company has the ability to call the 1995 Notes on  September  15, 2000. The  value  of  this  call is  determined  by new  issuance  yields  for  senior subordinated  debt at that time.  The value of this call rises when  yields fall and falls when  yields  rise.  New  issuance  yields are based on a spread  over treasury yields. If the yield on five-year  treasuries remains below 6.14% until September  30, 2000,  the Company  expects to be able to call the 1995 Notes and refinance  at the lower  prevailing  rates,  thus  offsetting  the effect of the payments  required  under  the  Treasury  Option  Derivative.  There  can  be no assurance,  however,  that the Company would be able to refinance the 1995 Notes at such time at favorable interest rates.       Senior Subordinated Notes The Company is also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent it is required to refinance  existing fixed rate indebtedness  at rates  higher than those  prevailing  at the time the  existing indebtedness  was  incurred.  As of December  31,  1998,  the Company has Senior Subordinated Notes totaling $1.9 million, $300 million and $450 million expiring in the years 2003,  2005 and 2007,  respectively.  Based upon the quoted  market price,  the fair value of the Notes was $781.4  million as of December 31, 1998. Generally,  the fair market value of the Notes will  decrease as interest  rates rise and  increase as  interest  rates fall.  The  Company  estimates  that a 1% increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the Notes by approximately $43.6 million as of December 31, 1998.  EQUITY PUT OPTION DERIVATIVES       The  Company is exposed to market  risk  relating  to its equity put option derivative instruments (the "Equity Puts"). The contract terms relating to these instruments  provide for  settlement  on the  expiration  date.  The Equity Puts require the Company to make a settlement  payment to the counterparties to these contracts  (payable  in either  cash or shares of the  Company's  Class A Common stock) in an amount that                                          43   is approximately  equal to the put strike price minus the price of the Company's Class A Common Stock as of the termination date. If the put strike price is less than the price of the Company's Class A Common Stock as of the termination date, the Company  would not be obligated to make a settlement  payment.
