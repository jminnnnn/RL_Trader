ITEM 7.                                      MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     The following Managements Discussion and Analysis provides qualitative and quantitative information about our financial performance and condition and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those statements.  This discussion consists of the following sections:     Executive Overview   a description of our business, financial highlights from 2014, information about industry trends and sources of revenues and operating costs;     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   a discussion of the accounting policies that are most important in understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the consolidated financial statements and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements;     Results of Operations   a summary of the components of our revenues by category and by network affiliation or program service arrangement, a summary of other operating data and an analysis of our revenues and expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012, including comparisons between years and certain expectations for 2015; and     Liquidity and Capital Resources   a discussion of our primary sources of liquidity, an analysis of our cash flows from or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, a discussion of our dividend policy and a summary of our contractual cash obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements.     We have one reportable operating segment (broadcast), which includes our television and radio stations and is reported separately from our other operating divisions and corporate activities.  The results of our other operating divisions consist primarily of revenues and expenses earned from sign design and fabrication; regional security alarm operating and bulk acquisitions; manufacturing and service of television broadcast antennas and transmitters; and real estate ventures.     STG, included in the broadcast segment and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (SBG), is the primary obligor under our Bank Credit Agreement, the 6.125% Notes, the 5.375% Notes,6.375% Notes, and 5.625% Notes.  SBG is a guarantor under the Bank Credit Agreement, the 6.125% Notes, the 5.375% Notes, 6.375% Notes, and 5.625% Notes.  Our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock remain obligations or securities of SBG and not obligations or securities of STG.  SBG was the obligor of the 9.25% Notes and the 8.375% Notes until they were fully redeemed in 2013 and 2014, respectively.     40          EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW     2014 Events     Acquisitions / Divestments:     ·                    Effective August 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Perpetual Corporation and equity interest of Charleston Television, LLC (the Allbritton Companies) for $985.0 million plus working capital of $50.2 million. We financed the total purchase price with proceeds from the issuance of 5.625% senior unsecured notes, a draw on our Bank Credit Agreement, and cash on hand. In conjunction with the acquisition, we terminated our LMA in Charleston, SC with WTAT-TV (FOX) and sold the non-license assets of WTAT to Cunningham for $14.0 million.  ·                    Effective September 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the assets of WGXA-TV (FOX) in Macon, GA from Frontier Broadcast Holdings, LLC for $33.0 million.  ·                    Effective September 1, 2014, we closed on the sale of WHTM-TV in Harrisburg, PA to Media General for $83.4 million.  ·                    On November 1, the Company closed on the previously announced purchase of the non-license assets of 8 stations in 3 markets from New Age Media.  ·                    On November 1, the Company closed on the previously announced purchase of the non-license assets of KSNV-TV (NBC) in Las Vegas, NV from Intermountain West.  ·                    On December 19, the Company closed on the acquisition of 4 stations in 3 markets from Media General, Inc. and the sale of 3 stations in 2 markets to Media General.     Other:     ·                    In February 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, payable on March 14, 2014 to the holders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2014.  ·                    During February 2014, we announced our intent to repurchase, under an existing authorization, from time to time, up to $100 million of our Class A common shares on the open market. During March 2014, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $150.0 million share repurchase authorization of Class A common shares, to be accessed once the existing authorization is exhausted. During 2014 we repurchased a total of $133.2 million or 4.9 million shares at an average price of $27.33 per share. As of December 31, 2014, the total remaining authorization for repurchases was $134.4 million.  ·                    Effective April 1, 2014, we promoted David B. Amy to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and named Christopher Ripley as Chief Financial Officer.  ·                    In April 2014, we reached a multi-year retransmission consent agreement with Charter Communications.  ·                    In May 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, payable on June 13, 2014, to the holders of record at the close of business on May 30, 2014.  ·                    In May 2014, we announced the launch of ONE Media, LLC, a joint venture between Coherent Logix and Sinclair with a vision to build the Next Generation Broadcast Platform, enabling broadcasting to be competitive across all platforms. This broadcast platform will support all business models, whether fixed services to the home, portable service within the home, or nomadic services outside the home.  ·                    In June 2014, we signed an agreement to broadcast getTV in 33 markets beginning in the summer 2014.  ·                    In July 2014, STG issued $550.0 million in senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum and mature on August 1, 2024. The proceeds from the offering of the 5.625% Notes, together with borrowings under our Bank Credit Agreement and cash on hand, were used to finance the acquisition of the Allbritton companies on July 31, 2014.  ·                    In July 2014, we amended and restated our existing bank credit facility raising $400.0 million of additional term loan B commitments, which matures in 2021 and bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a 0.75% floor. Additionally, $327.7 million of our term loan A commitments were converted to revolving commitments.  ·                    In July 2014, we launched the American Sports Network (ASN), a collegiate sports initiative to be broadcast on a number of our television stations, which have entered into comprehensive sports rights agreements with a number of distinguished NCAA Division I conferences.  ·                    In August 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.165 per share, payable on September 15, 2014 to the holders of record at the close of business on August 29, 2014.  ·                    In August 2014, we launched an Original Programming Division that will focus on the creation and development of low-cost original entertainment and long-form content.  ·                    Effective October 15, 2014, we redeemed all of the outstanding 8.375% Senior Notes due 2018, representing $237.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes.  ·                    In November 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.165 per share, payable on December 15, 2014 to the holders of record at the close of business on December 1, 2014.  ·                    In December 2014, we signed an agreement to broadcast Grit TV in 47 markets in December 2014 and January 2015.  ·                    During 2014, we successfully completed negotiations for new retransmission consent agreements with over 490 multichannel video programming distributors, including U-verse, FiOS, Armstrong Utilities, Atlantic Broadband, CableOne, CenturyLink, Wave Broadband and Wide Open West.  The new retransmission consent agreements provided uninterrupted carriage of our stations to over 6.3 million unique subscribers, representing over 99.9% of subscribers covered by the expiring agreements.     41          2015 Events     ·                    In January 2015, we appointed Howard E. Friedman to the Board of Directors. Mr. Friedman will stand for re-election at our next annual meeting of shareholders.  ·                    During January 2015, we repurchased $7.8 million or 0.3 million shares at an average price of $25.60 per share. As of January 31, 2015, the total remaining authorization for repurchases was $126.6 million.  ·                    In February 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.165 per share, payable March 13, 2015 to the holders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2015.     Industry Trends     ·                    Political advertising increases in even-numbered years, such as 2014, due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections and issue-related advertiser spending.  In every fourth year, such as 2012, political advertising is usually elevated further due to presidential elections;  ·                    The FCC has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi-channel broadcasts.  The FCC must-carry rules only apply to a stations primary digital stream;  ·                    Retransmission consent rules provide a mechanism for broadcasters to seek payment from MVPDs who carry broadcasters signals.  Recognition of the value of the programming content provided by broadcasters, including local news and other programming and network programming all in HD has generated increased local revenues;  ·                    We, as well as a number of other broadcasters, have joined and worked together in organizations such as the NAB (along with OMVC now merged), M500 and the MCV to focus on efforts to accelerate the nationwide availability of mobile DTV and other advanced digital distribution services and work through the many programming, advertising, distribution and aggregation opportunities.  There is potential for broadcasters to create an additional revenue stream by providing their signals to a wide variety of mobile / portable devices (tablets, laptops, smartphones, etc.) as well as through other multi-channel / multi-platform initiatives;  ·                    Many broadcasters are enhancing / upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content, such as newscasts and weather updates, to attract advertisers and to compete with other internet sites and smart phone and tablet device applications and other social media outlets;  ·                    Seasonal advertising increases occur in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers;  ·                    Broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements;  ·                    Station outsourcing arrangements are becoming more common as broadcasters seek out ways to improve revenues and margins; and  ·                    Advertising revenue related to the Olympics occurs in even numbered years and the Super Bowl is aired on a different network each year.  Both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues.     Sources of Revenues     Our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and, to a much lesser extent, from political advertisers.  We also generate local revenues from our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs.  Revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of total broadcast revenues.  We believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues, combined with a decrease in overall spending by advertisers transacted through our rep firm and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services.  Our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasingly competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non-traditional services to our advertisers including the success of multi-channel digital initiatives together with mobile DTV.  In addition, our revenue success is dependent on the success and advertising spending levels of the automotive industry.     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES     This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to goodwill and intangible assets, program contract costs, and income taxes.  We base our estimates on historical experience      42          and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  These estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results.  However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.     We consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application.  For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see  Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .     Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets     At least annually, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses for potential impairment indicators.  Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows, market conditions, operating performance of our stations, legal factors and other various qualitative factors.   As of December 31, 2014, our consolidated balance sheet includes $1,964.6 million of goodwill related to our Broadcast segment and $135.1 million of broadcast licenses.     Both our annual goodwill and broadcast license impairment assessments begin with qualitatively assessing whether it is more-likely-than-not that the respective asset has been impaired.  If we conclude that it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit or broadcast license is impaired, we apply the quantitative assessment, which involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or broadcast license to its respective carrying value.  See  Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets  within  Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  for further discussion of the significant judgments and estimates inherent in both qualitatively assessing whether impairment may exist and estimating the fair values of the reporting units and broadcast licenses.  See  Note 6. Goodwill, Broadcast Licenses and Other Intangible Assets  for the results of our annual impairment tests during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.     For our annual goodwill impairment tests in 2014 and 2013, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that goodwill was not impaired based on our qualitative assessments.  In 2012, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that goodwill was not impaired based on our qualitative assessments, except for three reporting units.  For those markets, we estimated the fair values of these reporting units, which had aggregate carrying value of goodwill of $79.5 million, and concluded that each of the reporting unit fair values exceeded the respective carrying values by more than 10%.  In estimating the fair values, an increase in the discount rates applied and/or decrease in market multiple assumed of 10%, would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill.     For our annual impairment tests for broadcast licenses in 2013 and 2012,  we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the broadcast licenses were not impaired based on our qualitative assessments.  In 2014, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that broadcast licenses were not impaired based on our qualitative assessments, except for broadcast licenses with an aggregate carrying value of $39.3 million for which we performed the quantitative assessment.  We concluded that licenses with an aggregate carrying value of $21.1 million exceeded their respective carrying values.  We recorded $3.2 million of impairment primarily as a result of declines in projected future market revenues related to the radio broadcast licenses.     We believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to evaluate whether it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and broadcast licenses were less than their carrying values.  If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, including future events such as a deterioration of market conditions or significant increases in discount rates, we could be exposed to impairment charges in the future.  Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows.     Program Contract Costs .  As discussed under  Programming  within  Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accountant Policies , we record an asset and corresponding liability for programming rights when the cost of each program is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted by the licensee in accordance with the conditions of the license agreement and the program is available for its first showing or telecast.  These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. To ensure the related assets for the programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value (NRV), management estimates future advertising revenue, net of sales commissions, to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms. Managements judgment is required in determining the timing of expense for these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program and may significantly differ from the timing of related payments under the contractual obligation.  If our estimates of future advertising revenues decline, amortization expense could be accelerated or NRV adjustments may be required.     43          Income Tax.    As discussed under  Income Taxes  within  Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accountant Policies , we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.  We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  In evaluating our ability to realize net deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including our past operating results, tax planning strategies and forecasts of future taxable income.  In considering these sources of taxable income, we must make certain judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage our underlying businesses on a long-term basis. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, a valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets related to a substantial amount of our available state net operating loss carryforwards based on past operating results, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary book/tax basis differences, alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income.  Future changes in operating and/or taxable income or other changes in facts and circumstances could significantly impact the ability to realize our deferred tax assets which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.     Management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions and we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits when such tax positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold.  Significant judgment is required in determining whether a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not threshold, and it is based on a variety of facts and circumstances, including interpretation of the relevant federal and state income tax codes, regulations, case law and other authoritative pronouncements.  Based on this analysis, the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations, liabilities are adjusted as necessary.  The resolution of audits is unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than for what we have provided.  See  Note 10. Income Taxes,  for further discussion of accrued unrecognized tax benefits.     Variable Interest Entities.   As discussed under  Variable Interest Entities  within  Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accountant Policies , we have determined that certain third-party licensees of stations that that we perform services to pursuant to arrangements, including LMAs and JSAs/SSAs, are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of those variable interests because, subject to the ultimate control of the licensees, we have the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE through the services we provide and because we absorb losses and returns that would be considered significant to the VIEs.  Determining whether the an entity is a VIE and whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interests requires judgment which is based on quantitative and qualitative factors that indicate whether or not we are absorbing a majority of the entitys economic risks or receiving a majority of the entitys economic rewards, based on the terms of the arrangements with the entity.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements     See  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  within  Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accountant Policies  for discussion on recent accounting policies and impact our financial statements.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     In general, this discussion is related to the results of our continuing operations, except for discussions regarding our cash flows, which also include the results of our discontinued operations.  The results of the acquired stations during the years ended 2012, 2013, and 2014 are included in our results of our continuing operations for the years ended 2012, 2013, and 2014 from their respective dates of acquisition. See  Note 2. Acquisitions  for further discussion of stations acquired.   Additionally, the results of certain television stations that were sold and classified as discontinued operations are not included in our results of our continuing operations for the period. See  Discontinued Operations  under  Note 3. Disposition of Assets and Discontinued Operations  for further discussion of excluded stations. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this discussion and analysis to 2014, 2013 and 2012 are to our fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Additionally, any references to the first, second, third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, respectively, for the year being discussed.  We have one reportable segment, broadcast that is disclosed separately from our other operating division and corporate activities.     44          Seasonality / Cyclicality     Our operating results are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations.  Usually, the second and fourth quarter operating results are higher than the first and third quarters because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.     Our operating results are usually subject to fluctuations from political advertising.  In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections.  Additionally, every four years, political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election.     Operating Data     The following table sets forth certain of our operating data from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions).  For definitions of terms, see the footnotes to the table in  Item 6.

Markets and Stations  under  Television Broadcasting  within  Item 1. Business , for further channel details.  We have acquired a significant number of television stations during 2014, 2013, and 2012, with a variety of network affiliations.  This acquisition activity affects the year-over-year comparability of revenue by affiliation.  See  Note 2. Acquisitions  for further discussion of stations acquired.     (b)           We broadcast other programming from the following providers on our channels including: Univision, This TV, ME TV, Retro TV, Get TV, Heartland, Grit, Accuweather WX, Weather Radar, Weather Nation, Live Well Network, Antenna TV, Bounce Network, Zuus Country, Azteca, Inmigrante TV, MundoFox, Telemundo and Estrella TV.     Net Broadcast Revenues .  Net broadcast revenues increased $565.2 million in 2014 when compared to 2013, of which $457.9 million was related to stations acquired during 2014. The remaining increase was due to an increase in retransmission revenues from MVPD and increases in advertising revenues generated from the political, medical and furniture sectors.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenues generated from the direct response, retail-department stores, and restaurants-other sectors.  Excluding the stations acquired in 2014, automotive, which typically is our largest category, represented 22.7% of net time sales for the year ended December 31, 2014.     Net broadcast revenues increased $296.9 million in 2013 when compared to 2012, of which $326.7 million was related to stations acquired during 2013. The remaining decrease was due to decreases in advertising revenues generated from the political, direct response and school sectors.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in retransmission revenues from multichannel video programming distributors (MVPD) and increases in advertising revenues generated from the automotive, food-grocery/other, and services sectors.  Excluding the stations acquired in 2013, automotive, which typically is our largest category, represented 25.1% of net time sales for the year ended December 31, 2013.     Political Revenues . Political revenues, which include time sales from political advertising, increased by $120.0 million to $131.8 million for 2014 when compared to 2013. Political revenues decreased by $85.1 million to $11.8 million for 2013 when compared to 2012.  Political revenues are typically higher in election years such as 2014 and 2012. Accordingly, we expect political revenues to decrease significantly in 2015, a non-election year, from 2014 levels.     Local Revenues .  Excluding political revenues, our local broadcast revenues, which include local times sales, retransmission revenues, digital, and other local revenues, were up $387.2 million for 2014 when compared to 2013, of which $345.0 million related to the stations acquired in 2014. The remaining increase is due to an increase in advertising spending particularly in the medical, religion, and home products sectors and an increase in retransmission revenues from MVPDs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease due to a decline in advertising revenues from the schools, direct response and fast food sectors. Excluding political revenues, our local broadcast revenues, which include local times sales, retransmission revenues and other local revenues, were up $311.0 million for 2013 when compared to 2012, of which $250.9 million related to the stations acquired in 2013. The remaining increase is due to an increase in advertising spending particularly in the automotive, services, and grocery/other sectors and an      46          increase in retransmission revenues from MVPDs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease due to a decline in advertising revenues from the restaurants, schools and retail/department stores sectors.     National Revenues.   O ur national broadcast revenues, excluding political revenues, which include national time sales and other national revenues, were up $58.0 million for 2014 when compared to 2013, of which $77.7 million related to the stations acquired in 2014.  The remaining decrease was due to decreases in advertising revenues generated from the direct response, automotive, and food-grocery/other sectors.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in advertising revenues in the services, schools and drugs/cosmetics sectors.  Excluding political revenues, our national broadcast revenues increased $71.0 million for 2013 when compared to 2012, of which $70.2 million related to the stations acquired in 2013.  The remaining increase was due to increases in advertising revenues generated from the automotive, media and restaurants sectors.  These increases were partially offset by a decline in advertising revenues in the fast food, other and movie sectors.     Broadcast Expenses     The following table presents our significant operating expense categories for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):                                                        Percent Change    (Increase/(Decrease))                          2014           2013           2012           14 vs. 13           13 vs. 12              Station production   expenses           $     577.0           $     385.1           $     255.5           49.8     %     50.7     %        Station selling,   general and administrative expenses           $     370.6           $     249.7           $     171.3           48.4     %     45.8     %        Amortization of   program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments           $     106.6           $     80.9           $     61.0           31.8     %     32.6     %        Corporate general   and administrative expenses           $     56.2           $     47.3           $     28.9           18.8     %     63.7     %        Depreciation and   amortization expenses           $     218.5           $     133.1           $     77.5           64.2     %     71.7     %           Station production expenses.   Station production expenses increased $191.9 million during 2014 compared to 2013, of which $158.9 million related to the stations not included in the same period in 2013. The remaining increases for the year were primarily due to an increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements, increased costs related to sports programming content, and increased compensation expense.     Station production expenses increased $129.6 million during 2013 compared to 2012, of which $107.2 million related to stations not included in the same period of 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements, increased compensation expense, including incentive compensation.     Station selling, general and administrative expenses.   Station selling, general and administrative expenses increased $120.9 million during 2014 compared to 2013, of which $111.7 million related to stations not included in the same period in 2013. The remaining increases for the year were primarily due to an increase in information technology infrastructure costs and compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in digital interactive expenses.     Station selling, general and administrative expenses increased $78.4 million during 2013 compared to 2012, of which $75.4 million related to the stations not included in the same period in 2012. The remaining increases for the year were primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, including incentive compensation, partially offset by lower national sales commissions.     Amortization of program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments.   The amortization of program contract costs increased $25.7 million during 2014 compared to 2013, of which $16.6 million related to the stations not included in the same period of 2013.  The remaining increase is due to additional programming content and higher programming costs.     The amortization of program contract costs increased $19.9 million during 2013 compared to 2012, of which $14.8 million related to the stations not included in the same period of 2012.  The remaining increase is due to higher programming costs.     Corporate general and administrative expenses.   See explanation under  Corporate and Unallocated Expenses.     Depreciation and amortization expenses.   Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangibles and other assets increased $85.4 million during 2014 compared 2013, of which $87.3 million related to the stations not included in the same period of 2012.  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $55.6 million during 2013 compared to 2012, of which $57.3 million related to a station not included in the same period of 2012.     47          OTHER OPERATING DIVISIONS REVENUE AND EXPENSE     The following table presents our other operating divisions revenue and expenses which is comprised of the following for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions): Triangle Signs & Services, LLC (Triangle), a sign designer and fabricator; Alarm Funding Associates, LLC. (Alarm Funding), a regional security alarm operating and bulk acquisition company; real estate ventures and other nominal businesses.                                                        Percent Change                          2014           2013           2012           14 vs. 13           13 vs. 12              Revenues:                                                                          Triangle (b)           $     28.9           $     26.8           $     26.5           7.8     %     1.1     %        Alarm Funding           $     25.0           $     18.3           $     16.0           36.6     %     14.4     %        Real Estate   Ventures            $     8.3           $     7.4           $     9.3           12.2     %     (20.4     )%        Other           $     9.4           $     4.3           $     2.4           118.6     %     79.2     %                                                                                   Expenses:   (a)                                                                          Triangle (b)           $     26.1           $     25.1           $     25.9           4.0     %     (3.1     )%        Alarm Funding           $     21.9           $     15.7           $     12.9           39.5     %     21.7     %        Real Estate   Ventures            $     14.7           $     13.7           $     12.6           7.3     %     8.7     %        Other           $     9.1           $     7.0           $     4.6           30.0     %     52.2     %            (a)           Comprises total expenses of the entity including other operating divisions expenses, depreciation and amortization and applicable other income and expense items such as interest expense and non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to issuances of subsidiary stock awards.     (b)           The assets and liabilities of Triangle are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2014.  See Assets held for sale  within  Note 3. Disposition of assets and discontinued operations  for further discussion.     The year over year increases in Triangles revenue and expenses during 2014 compared to 2013 and 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to increases in sales volume due to new service contracts.  The increases in Alarm Fundings revenue and expenses during 2014 compared to 2013 and 2013 compared to 2012 were primarily due to the acquisition of new alarm monitoring contracts.  Revenues and expenses increased for our consolidated real estate ventures over the same periods due to an increase in leasing activity for operating real estate properties, and sales of property under development.  As of December 31, 2014, we held $112.7 million of real estate for development and sale.  The increases in revenue and expenses during 2013 compared to 2012 for Other were primarily due to the acquisition of Dielectric, LLC during 2013.     Income (loss) from Equity and Cost Method Investments.   As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of our investments in private equity funds and real estate ventures, accounted for under the equity or cost method, was $23.6 million and $71.8 million in 2014 and $25.2 million and $69.3 million in 2013, respectively.  Results of our equity and cost method investments in private investment funds and real estate ventures are included in income from equity and cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operations. During 2014, we recorded income of $3.1 million related to certain private investment funds and a loss of $1.0 million related to our real estate ventures. During 2013, we recorded income of $2.0 million related to certain private investment funds and income of $1.4 million related to our real estate ventures.  During 2012, we recorded income of $2.2 million related to certain private equity funds and income of $7.4 million related to our real estate ventures, including a $7.9 million gain on the sale of three of our real estate ventures, partially offset by a $0.9 million impairment charge related to one of our real estate ventures.     CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED EXPENSES                                                        Percent Change    (Increase/(Decrease))                          2014           2013           2012           14 vs. 13           13 vs. 12              Corporate general   and administrative expenses           $     12.3           $     4.5           $     2.8           173.3     %     60.7     %        Interest expense           $     170.8           $     159.7           $     125.3           7.0     %     27.5     %        Loss from   extinguishment of debt           $     14.6           $     58.4           $     0.3           (75.0     )%     n/m              Income tax   provision            $     97.4           $     41.2           $     67.9           136.4     %     (39.3     )%           n/m  not meaningful     48          Corporate general and administrative expenses .  We allocate most of our corporate general and administrative expenses to the broadcast segment.  The explanation that follows combines corporate general and administrative expenses found in the  Broadcast Segment  section with the corporate general and administrative expenses found in this section,  Corporate and Unallocated Expenses .  These results exclude general and administrative costs from our other operating divisions which are included in our discussion of expenses in the  Other Operating Divisions Revenues and Expense  section.     Combined corporate general and administrative expenses increased to $68.4 million in 2014 from $51.8 million in 2013.  The increase is primarily due to an increase in overhead costs related to our recent acquisitions and includes $6.5 million of development costs associated with ONE Media, LLC during 2014.     Combined corporate general and administrative expenses increased to $51.8 million in 2013 from $31.7 million in 2012.  This is primarily due to an increase in transaction costs due to our recent acquisitions, an increase in higher health insurance costs and higher employee incentive / performance bonuses.     We expect corporate general and administrative expenses to increase in 2015 compared to 2014.     Interest expense.   Interest expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the issuance of $550.0 million of 5.625% Notes and incremental borrowings on our Term Loan A, Term Loan B, and revolving credit facility under our Bank Credit Agreement during 2014; and the issuance of $600.0 million of 5.375% Notes and the issuance of $350.0 million of 6.375% Notes in 2013. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the redemption of 8.375% Notes during 2014; and the redemption of our 9.25% Notes, 4.875% Notes and 3.0% Notes in 2013.     Interest expense increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the issuance of $500 million of 6.125% Notes in the fourth quarter 2012, the incremental borrowings on our Term Loan A and Term Loan B under our Bank Credit Agreement for our acquisitions in 2013, the issuance of $600.0 million of 5.375% Notes in the second quarter of 2013, and the issuance of $350.0 million of 6.375% Notes in the fourth quarter of 2013. Interest expense was partially offset by a decrease due to the redemption of our 9.25% Notes, our 4.875% Notes and our 3.0% Notes in the fourth quarter of 2013.     We expect interest expense to increase in 2015 compared to 2014.     Loss from extinguishment of debt.   We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the redemption of the 8.375% Notes in October 2014.     During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $59.4 million related to the amendments of our Bank Credit Agreement in April and October 2013 and redemption of 9.25% Notes in October 2013, partially offset by a $1.0 million gain on extinguishment from our 3.0% Notes, resulting in a $58.4 million loss from extinguishment of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2012, drew down on our incremental borrowings under the Bank Credit Agreement and wrote off a portion of our deferred financing costs and debt discount on the Term Loan B, resulting in a loss of $0.3 million from extinguishment of debt.     Income tax provision.   The 2014 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the noncontrolling interest) of $309.7 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.5%.  The 2013 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the noncontrolling interest) of $103.2 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 40.0%.  The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is primarily due to the following items:  1) remeasurement of deferred state tax liabilities due to intercompany mergers and changes in estimates of apportionment in certain states resulting in a $8.2 million benefit in 2014 compared to a $7.0 million expense in 2013; 2) $10.8 million reduction in liability for unrecognized tax benefits in 2014 as a result of statute of limitations expiration, which was partially offset by 3) greater benefit of state law changes in 2013.     The 2013 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the noncontrolling interest) of $103.2 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 40.0%.  The 2012 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the noncontrolling interest) of $212.1 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.0%.  The increase in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to the following items: 1) greater expenses of consolidated VIEs in 2013 that are treated as pass-through entities for income tax purposes; and 2) a 2012 release of valuation allowance of $7.7 million related to certain deferred tax assets of Cunningham, one of our consolidated VIEs, as the weight of all available evidence supports realization of the deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance release determination was based primarily on the sufficiency of forecasted taxable income necessary to utilize NOLs expiring in years 2022  2029.  This VIE files separate income tax     49          returns.  Any resulting tax liabilities are nonrecourse to us and we are not entitled to any benefit resulting from the deferred tax assets of the VIE     As of December 31, 2014, we had a net deferred tax liability of $608.9 million as compared to a net deferred tax liability of $312.8 million as of December 31, 2013.  The increase primarily relates to an increase in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the 2014 stock acquisitions with greater book basis in intangible and fixed assets.     As of December 31, 2014, we had $7.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits.  Of this total, $6.5 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate from continuing operations.  As of December 31, 2013, we had $16.9 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits.  Of this total, $15.7 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate from continuing operations. We recognized $0.7 million and $1.2 million of income tax expense for interest related to uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  See  Note 10. Income Taxes  for further discussion.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     As of December 31, 2014, we had $17.7 million in cash and cash equivalent balances and net working capital of approximately $32.2 million.  Cash generated by our operations and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement are used as our primary sources of liquidity.  We anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from our operations and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements and working capital needs for the next twelve months.  For our long-term liquidity needs, in addition to the sources described above, we may rely upon the issuance of long-term debt, the issuance of equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for equity, or the sale of non-core assets.  However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital or buyers of our non-core assets will be available, or that the terms of any transactions will be acceptable or advantageous to us.     On March 20, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $150.0 million share repurchase authorization, in addition to the $150.0 million previously authorized.  There is no expiration date, and currently management has no plans to terminate this program. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we have purchased approximately 4.9 million shares for $133.2 million. As of December 31, 2014, the total remaining authorization was $134.4 million.     In July 2014, we amended and restated our existing bank credit facility raising $400.0 million of incremental term loan B.  The incremental credit facility matures in July 2021.  Additionally, $327.7 million of term loan A, including $72.5 million of the remaining $108.2 million delayed draw, were converted into revolving commitments. Remaining borrowing capacity under the Revolver was $144.1 million as of December 31, 2014. See  Bank Credit Agreement  within  Note 7. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing  for further discussion.     In July 2014, we issued $550.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum and mature on August 1, 2024.  See  5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2014  within  Note 7. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing  for further discussion.     Effective October 15, 2014, we redeemed all of the outstanding 8.375% Senior Notes due 2018, representing $237.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes as of October 15, 2014. See  8.375% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2018  within  Note 7 .

This increase is primarily due to $1,485.0 million in payments for the acquisition of television stations during 2014 compared to $1,006.1 million during 2013.  See  Note. 2 Acquisitions  for discussion of stations acquired during those periods.  The increase was also caused by higher capital expenditures and purchases of alarm monitoring contracts during 2014.  The increase was partially offset by $176.7 million in sales of broadcast assets during 2014 compared to $49.7 million in 2013.  See  Note 3. Disposition of Assets and Discontinued Operations  for discussion the sale of broadcast assets during the periods.  The increase was also offset by proceeds from insurance settlements and the release of cash deposits for station acquisitions in 2014.     Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. This decrease is primarily due to $1,006.1 million in payments for the acquisition of television stations during 2013 compared to $1,135.3 million during 2012.  See  Note. 2 Acquisitions  for discussion of stations acquired during those periods.  The decrease was also caused by $49.7 million sale of broadcast assets during 2013 and lower investments in cost and equity method investments.  See  Note 3. Disposition of Assets and Discontinued Operations  for discussion the sale of broadcast assets during 2013.  The decrease was partially offset by higher purchases of alarm monitoring contracts and an increase in restricted cash for station acquisitions compared to a decrease in 2012.     Financing Activities     Net cash flows from financing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the same period in 2013.  The decrease is primarily related to the $133.2 million repurchase of Class A Common Stock and higher dividend payments during 2014 and the $472.9 million proceeds from issuance of Class A Common Stock in 2013. The decrease is partially offset by higher issuance of debt, net of redemptions, in the 2014 compared to 2013.     Net cash flows from financing activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The increase is primarily due to issuing $600.0 million and $350.0 million of 5.375% and 6.375% Notes, respectively, and $250.0 million net proceeds from our Bank Credit Agreement, $472.9 million proceeds received from our offering of Class A common stock, decreases in dividends paid from $1.54 per share during 2012 to $0.60 per share during 2013, and increases in loans by our consolidated variable interest entities. This increase is partially offset by redemption of our 9.375% Notes and increased payments for deferred financing costs.     51          During 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the months of February, April, August and November, which were paid in March, June, September and December, respectively, for total dividend payments of $0.60 per share for the year ended December 31, 2013.  During 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the months of February and April, and $0.165 per share in the months of August and November, which were paid in March, June, September and December, respectively, for total dividend payments of $0.63 per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.  In February 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.165 per share.  Future dividends on our common shares, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on several factors including our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, covenant restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.  The Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock holders have the same rights related to dividends.  Under our Bank Credit Agreement, in certain circumstances, we may make up to $200.0 million in unrestricted annual cash payments including but not limited to dividends, of which $50.0 million may carry over to the next year.     Contractual Obligations     We have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed.  For example, we are contractually committed to acquire future programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.     The following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2014 and the future periods in which   such obligations are expected to be settled in cash (in millions):     CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS  (a)                    Total           2015           2016-2017           2018-2019           2020 and    thereafter (b)              Notes payable,   capital leases and commercial bank financing (c), (d)           $     4,803.2           $     234.0           $     397.6           $     832.7           $     3,338.9              Notes and capital   leases payable to affiliates (c)           27.6           4.4           8.2           3.8           11.2              Operating leases           65.1           12.8           21.4           10.6           20.3              Program content (e)           1,035.0           308.9           535.2           184.4           6.5              Programming   services (f)           96.4           43.5           29.5           16.0           7.4              Investments and   loan commitments (h)           15.0           15.0                                               Other (g)            30.8           6.0           8.9           4.9           11.0              Total contractual   cash obligations           $     6,073.1           $     624.6           $     1,000.8           $     1,052.4           $     3,395.3                    (a)           Excluded from this table are $7.1 million of accrued unrecognized tax benefits.  Due to inherent uncertainty, we cannot make reasonable estimates of the amount and period payments will be made.     (b)           Includes a one-year estimate of $7.4 million in payments related to contracts that automatically renew.  We have not calculated potential payments for years after 2020.     (c)            Includes interest on fixed rate debt and capital leases.  Estimated interest on our variable rate debt has been excluded.  Variable rate debt represents $1.9 billion of our $3.9 billion total face value of debt as of December 31, 2014.     (d)           See  Note 7. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing  in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the changes to notes payable, capital leases, and commercial bank financing during 2014.     (e)            Our Program content includes contractual amounts owed through the expiration date of the underlying agreement for active and future program contracts, network programming and additional advertising inventory in various dayparts. Active program contracts are included in the balance sheet as an asset and liability while future program contracts are excluded until the cost is known, the program is available for its first showing or telecast and the licensee has accepted the program.  Industry protocol typically enables us to make payments for program contracts on a three-month lag, which differs from the contractual timing within the table.  Network programming agreements may include variable fee components such as subscriber levels, which in certain circumstances have been estimated and reflected in the table.     52          (f)             Includes obligations related to rating service fees, music license fees, market research, weather and news services.     (g)            Other includes obligations related to post-retirement benefits, maintenance and support, other corporate contracts, other long term liabilities, and LMA and outsourcing agreements. Excluded from the table are estimated amounts due pursuant to LMAs and outsourcing agreements where we consolidate the counterparty. The fees that we are required to pay under these agreements total $3.0 million, $3.6 million, $0.6 million and $1.0 million for the periods 2015, 2016-2017, 2018-2019 and 2020 and thereafter, respectively. Certain station related operating expenses are paid by the licensee and reimbursed by us under the LMA agreements. Certain of these expenses that are in connection with contracts are included in table above.     (h)           Commitments to contribute capital to Patriot Capital II, LP, Patriot Capital III, LP and Caves Valley Partners.        Off Balance Sheet Arrangements     Off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the SEC means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party, under which the registrant has:  obligations under certain guarantees or contracts; retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements; obligations under certain derivative arrangements; and obligations arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. As of December 31, 2014, we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.     ITEM 7A.                                         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates.  At times we enter into derivative instruments primarily for the purpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt.  See  Note 7. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing,  for further discussion.  As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments.     We are exposed to risk from the changing interest rates of our variable rate debt, primarily related to our Bank Credit Agreement.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense on our term loans and revolver related to our Bank Credit Agreement was $38.7 million.  We estimate that adding 1.0% to respective interest rates would result in an increase in our interest expense of $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.  We also have $118.8 million of variable rate debt associated with our other operating divisions.  We estimate that adding 1.0% to respective interest rates would result in $0.8 million of additional interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Our consolidated VIEs have $30.2 million of variable rate debt associated with the stations that we provide services to pursuant to LMAs and other outsourcing arrangements.  We estimate that adding 1.0% to respective interest rates would an increase interest expense of the VIEs by $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.     ITEM 8.                                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
