Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing  for more information.  ·                    In October 2013, 100% of the outstanding 3.0% Notes, representing principal of $5.4 million, were converted and settled fully in cash for $10.5 million, as permitted under the indenture; and  ·                    In November 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, payable on December 13, 2013, to the holders of record at the close of business on November 29, 2013;     2014 Events     ·                    In January 2014, we exchanged 99.7% of our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021 for 6.375% Senior Notes due 2021 registered under the Securities Act of 1933.  ·                    In February 2014, we entered into an agreement for a $0.5 million investment, purchasing Series A Preferred Units of Timeline Labs, and anticipates utilizing their products on 15 of our news-producing stations. Timeline Labs specializes in proprietary tools that discover, measure, and display trending social content in real time in such a way as to allow these items to be incorporated into live newscasts and shows.  ·                    In February 2014, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (the Company) announced that, effective April 2, 2014, David B. Amy would be promoted to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Christopher Ripley would become the Companys Chief Financial Officer.     Industry Trends     ·                    Political advertising increases in even-numbered years, such as 2012, due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections and issue-related advertiser spending.  In every fourth year, such as 2012, political advertising is usually elevated further due to presidential elections;     45          ·                    The FCC has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi-channel broadcasts.  The FCC must-carry rules only apply to a stations primary digital stream;  ·                    Retransmission consent rules provide a mechanism for broadcasters to seek payment from MVPDs who carry broadcasters signals.  Recognition of the value of the programming content provided by broadcasters, including local news and other programming and network programming all in HD has generated increased local revenues;  ·                    We, as well as a number of other broadcasters, have joined and worked together in organizations such as the NAB (along with OMVC now merged), M500 and the MCV to focus on efforts to accelerate the nationwide availability of mobile DTV and other advanced digital distribution services and work through the many programming, advertising, distribution and aggregation opportunities.  There is potential for broadcasters to create an additional revenue stream by providing their signals to a wide variety of mobile / portable devices (tablets, laptops, smartphones, etc.) as well as through other multi-channel / multi-platform initiatives;  ·                    Many broadcasters are enhancing / upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content, such as newscasts and weather updates, to attract advertisers and to compete with other internet sites and smart phone and tablet device applications and other social media outlets;  ·                    Seasonal advertising increases occur in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers;  ·                    Broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements;  ·                    Station outsourcing arrangements are becoming more common as broadcasters seek out ways to improve revenues and margins;  ·                    Advertising revenue related to the Olympics occurs in even numbered years and the Super Bowl is aired on a different network each year.  Both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues; and     Sources of Revenues and Costs     Our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and, to a much lesser extent, from political advertisers.  We also generate local revenues from our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs.  Our revenues from local advertisers have seen a continued upward trend, with the exception of 2008 and 2009 when non-political revenues fell due to the economic recession.  Revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of total broadcast revenues.  We believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues, combined with a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services.  Our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasingly competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non-traditional services to our advertisers including the success of multi-channel digital initiatives together with mobile DTV.  In addition, our revenue success is dependent on the success and advertising spending levels of the automotive industry.     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES     This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts, program contract costs, intangible assets, income taxes, property and equipment, and investments.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  These estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results.  However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.     We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations.  For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see  Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.     Valuation of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Equity and Cost Method Investments .     We periodically evaluate our goodwill, broadcast licenses, long-lived assets, intangible assets and equity and cost method investments for potential impairment indicators.  Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows,      46          market conditions, operating performance of our stations, legal factors and other various qualitative factors.     We have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets, which requires such assets along with our goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often when certain triggering events occur.  As of December 31, 2013, we had $1,380.1 million of goodwill, $101.0 million in broadcast licenses, and $1,127.8 million in definite-lived intangibles.  We perform our annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses at the beginning of the fourth quarter each year.     In 2011, we early adopted the accounting guidance related to the annual goodwill impairment assessment, which allowed us, to first qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that goodwill has been impaired.  As part of our qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment, we consider the following factors related to the reporting units, where applicable:     ·                    Significant changes in the macroeconomic conditions;  ·                    Significant changes in the regulatory environment;  ·                    Significant changes in the operating model, management, products and services, customer base, cost structure and/or margin trends;  ·                    Comparison of current and prior year operating performance and forecast trends for future operating performance; and  ·                    The excess of the fair value over carrying value of the reporting units determined in prior quantitative assessments.     If we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired, we will apply the quantitative two-step method for goodwill.  Prior to 2011, the annual impairment test for goodwill was performed using the quantitative two-step method for all reporting units.  Our quantitative assessment for goodwill consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting units, using a combination of a market approach, using recent comparable market transactions and estimated market multiples, and an income approach, using a discounted cash flow model.  The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment consist of discount rates, revenue and expense growth rates and comparable business multiples.  The projected growth rates are based on our internal forecast of future performance, historical trends, and projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections.  The discount rate is based on a number of factors including market interest rates, a weighted average cost of capital analysis based on the target capital structure for a television station, and includes adjustments for market risk and company specific risk.  For goodwill, if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we then perform the second step which requires allocation of the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill to determine the implied fair value.  An impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount.     We early adopted the recent accounting guidance related to the annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, which allowed us, beginning with our 2012 indefinite-lived intangible impairment test, to first qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset has been impaired.  As part of our qualitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we consider the following factors related to the indefinite-lived intangible asset, where applicable:     ·                    Significant changes in cost factors that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset;  ·                    Significant changes in the legal or regulatory environment;  ·                    Significant changes in management, key personnel, strategy or customers that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset;  ·                    Significant changes in the industry and/or market;  ·                    Significant changes in macroeconomic conditions;  ·                    Comparison of current and prior year operating performance and forecast trends for future operating performance; and  ·                    The excess of the fair value over carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets determined in prior quantitative assessments.     If we conclude that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we will calculate the fair market value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and compare to the book value.  Prior to 2012, the annual impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangibles, broadcast licenses, involved a quantitative assessment in which we estimated the fair market value of our broadcast licenses and compared to the book value.  We estimated the fair market value of our broadcast licenses using a discounted cash flow model.  The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses consist of discount rates, normalized market share, normalized profit margin, expected future growth rates and estimated start-up costs.  We then compared the estimated fair market value to the book value of these assets to determine if impairment exists.  For the broadcast licenses, if the fair value is less than book value, we would record the resulting impairment.     47          We aggregate our stations by market for purposes of our goodwill and license impairment testing and we believe that our markets are most representative of our broadcast reporting units because segment management views, manages and evaluates our stations on a market basis.  Furthermore, in our markets where we operate or provide services to more than one station, certain costs of operating the stations are shared including the use of buildings and equipment, the sales force and administrative personnel.  Our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within each designated marketing area, as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms-length transaction.     Based on the annual qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment performed in 2013, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of all reporting units would sufficiently exceed their carrying value and thus it was not necessary to perform the quantitative two-step method.  Based on the results of our annual qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment performed in 2013, we concluded that we would need to perform a quantitative Step 1 test for three of our markets which had aggregate goodwill of $79.5 million as of October 1, 2012, the date of our annual impairment test.  These markets had a decrease in operating results for the past few years and therefore, we estimated the fair value of these reporting units based on a market approach and income approach.  For all three markets, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value by more than 10%.  For all our other reporting units, we concluded based on the qualitative assessment that it was more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units would sufficiently exceed their carrying values and it was not necessary to perform the quantitative two-step method.     For the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase in our discount rate and/or a decrease in our multiple of 10% would not have resulted in goodwill impairment.  Based on the annual qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment performed in 2011, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of all reporting units would sufficiently exceed their carrying value and thus it was not necessary to perform the quantitative two-step method.  The qualitative factors for our reporting units reviewed during our annual assessments, with the exception of the three markets in which we performed a quantitative assessment in 2012, indicated stable or improving margins and favorable or stable forecasted economic conditions including stable discount rates and comparable or improving business multiples. Additionally, the results of prior quantitative assessments supported significant excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units.     Based on the annual qualitative assessment for broadcast license impairment performed in 2013 and 2012, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of all broadcast licenses would sufficiently exceed their carrying values and thus it was not necessary to perform a quantitative test.  The qualitative factors for our broadcast licenses indicated an increase in market revenues, consistent expected market growth rates, stable market shares and stable cost factors from 2011 through 2013.  We recorded a $0.4 million interim impairment charge in the first quarter of 2011 due to an anticipated increase in construction costs for one of our stations as a result of converting to full power.  As a result of our annual impairment test for broadcast licenses in 2011, under which we applied the required quantitative test, we concluded that impairment did not exist.     We believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to evaluate whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units and broadcast licenses was less than their carrying values.  If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, including future events such as a deterioration of market conditions or significant increases in discount rates, we could be exposed to impairment charges in the future.  Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows.     For all other long-lived assets, including fixed assets and definite-lived intangibles, we assess recoverability of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the assets may not be recoverable.  If we conclude that such triggering event has occurred, we perform a two-step quantitative test to first assess whether the asset is recoverable by comparing the sum of undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group, including goodwill.  If the sum of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, we then measure and allocate the amount of impairment to record for each of the assets in the asset group by comparing the respective fair value of the assets to their carrying values.  We did not have any indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets in 2011, 2012 or 2013.     When factors indicate that there may be a decrease in value of an equity or cost method investment, we assess that investment and determine whether a loss in value has occurred.  If that loss is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recorded.  For any investments that indicate a potential impairment, we estimate the fair value of those investments using discounted cash flow models, unrelated third party valuations or industry comparables, based on the various facts available to us.  During 2013 and 2012, we recorded $0.6 million and $1.3 million of impairment on equity method investments, respectively.  No impairment of our equity or cost method investments was recorded 2011.     Revenue Recognition .  Advertising revenues, net of agency commissions, are recognized in the period during which commercials are aired.  All other revenues are recognized as services are provided.  The revenues realized from station barter arrangements are recorded as the programs are aired at the estimated fair value of the advertising airtime given in exchange for the program rights.  Some of our retransmission consent agreements contain both advertising and retransmission consent elements that are paid in cash.  We have determined that these agreements are revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.  Advertising and retransmission consent     48          deliverables sold under our agreements are separated into different units of accounting based on fair value.  Revenue applicable to the advertising element of the arrangement is recognized consistent with the advertising revenue policy noted above.  Revenue applicable to the retransmission consent element of the arrangement is recognized over the life of the agreement.     Program Contract Costs .  We have agreements with distributors for the rights to televise programming over contract periods, which generally run from one to seven years.  Contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period.  Each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing.  The portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded $99.0 million and $69.3 million, respectively, in program contract assets and $125.6 million and $104.4 million, respectively, in program contract liabilities.     The programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value (NRV).  Estimated NRVs are based on managements expectation of future advertising revenue, net of sales commissions, to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms.  Amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using a four-year accelerated method or a straight-line method, depending on the length of the contract.  Program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets.  Program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not impacted by adjustments for amortization or estimated NRV.  If our estimate of future advertising revenues declines, then additional write downs to NRV may be required.     Income Tax.   We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.  As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded $312.8 million and $235.4 million, respectively, in net deferred tax liabilities.  We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  In evaluating our ability to realize net deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including our past operating results, tax planning strategies and forecasts of future taxable income.  In considering these sources of taxable income, we must make certain judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage our underlying businesses on a long-term basis.  A valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets related to a substantial portion of our available state net operating loss carryforwards, based on past operating results, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary book/tax basis differences, alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements     In July 2012, the FASB issued new guidance for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The new guidance allows companies to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary, similar to the approach now applied to goodwill. Companies can first determine based on certain qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The new standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The revised standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 2012 and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this new guidance in the fourth quarter of 2012 when completing our annual impairment analysis. This guidance impacted how we perform our annual impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and changed our related disclosures for 2012; however, it does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as the guidance does not impact the timing or amount of any resulting impairment charges.     In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance requiring disclosure of items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). This new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of AOCI. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2012. This guidance does not have a material impact on our financial statements.     In July 2013, the FASB issued new guidance requiring new disclosure of unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. If a company does not have: (i) a net operating loss carryforward; (ii) a similar tax loss; or (iii) a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. The authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years and the interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2013 and should be applied on a prospective basis. We do not expect this requirement to have a material impact on our financial statements.     49          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     In general, this discussion is related to the results of our continuing operations, except for discussions regarding our cash flows, which also include the results of our discontinued operations The results of the acquired stations from Freedom Communications (Freedom) as of April 1, 2012, Newport Television (Newport) as of December 1, 2012 (acquisition date), Cox Media Group (Cox) as of May 1, 2013 (acquisition date), Fisher Communications (Fisher) as of August 8, 2013, TTBG as of October 1, 2013, Barrington as of November 22, 2013, and six other television stations during the year ended 2012 and 2013 are included in our results of our continuing operations. In 2012, we determined that the operating results of WLAJ-TV, which was one of the stations acquired in the Freedom acquisition, and WLWC-TV, which was one of the stations acquired in the Four Points acquisition, should be accounted for as discontinued operations and therefore the results are not included in our consolidated results of continuing operations year ended December 31, 2013. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this discussion and analysis to 2013, 2012 and 2011 are to our fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Additionally, any references to the first, second, third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, respectively, for the year being discussed.  We have one reportable segment, broadcast that is disclosed separately from our other operating division and corporate activities.     Seasonality / Cyclicality     Our operating results are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations.  Usually, the second and fourth quarter operating results are higher than the first and third quarters because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.     Our operating results are usually subject to fluctuations from political advertising.  In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections.  Additionally, every four years, political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election.     Operating Data     The following table sets forth certain of our operating data from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions).  For definitions of terms, see the footnotes to the table in  Item 6.

which include the advertising portion of our local and national broadcast revenues, were automotive (25.2%), services (16.6%),  retail / department stores(6.1%), schools (5.5%), medical (5.3%) and fast food (5.1%).  No other advertising category accounted for more than 5.0% of our net time sales in 2013.  No advertiser accounted for more than 1.5% of our consolidated revenue in 2013.  We conduct business with thousands of advertisers.     Our primary types of programming and their approximate percentages of 2013 net time sales were syndicated programming (33.4%), network programming (27.8%), local news (26.2%), sports programming (8.0%) and direct advertising programming (4.6%).     From a network affiliation or program service arrangement perspective, the following table sets

   (a)           During  2013, we acquired or entered into outsourcing agreements to provide certain non-programming related sales, operational and administrative services to 63 stations with the following network affiliation or program service arrangements: CBS (ten stations in the third quarter and four in the fourth quarter), FOX (two stations in the second quarter, three in the third quarter and eight in the fourth quarter), NBC (two stations in the second quarter, three in the third quarter and eight in the fourth quarter), ABC (two stations in the third quarter and six in the fourth quarter), CW (one station in the third quarter and seven the fourth quarter), Univision (five stations in the third quarter), and MyNetworkTV (two stations in the second quarter).  We reclassified the results of operations of WLAJ-TV, an ABC station acquired in the second quarter of 2012 and WLWC-TV a CW station acquired in the first quarter of 2012, as discontinued operations as discussed in  Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and therefore the net time sales of WLAJ-TV and WLWC-TV are not included in the percentages above and are excluded from the number of stations.     (b)           We broadcast programming from  network affiliations or program service arrangements with CBS (rebroadcasted content from other primary channels within the same markets), The CW, MyNetworkTV, This TV, ME TV, Retro TV, Weather Radar, Weather Nation, Live Well Network,     51                                   Antenna TV, Bounce Network, Retro TV, Zuus Country, Azteca, Tele-Romantica, Inmigrante TV, MundoFox, Telemundo and Estrella TV on additional channels through our stations second and third digital signals.     Net Broadcast Revenues .   Net broadcast revenues increased $296.9 million in 2013 when compared to 2012, of which $326.7 million was related to stations acquired during 2013. The remaining decrease was due to decreases in advertising revenues generated from the political, direct response and school sectors.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in retransmission revenues from multichannel video programming distributors (MVPD) and increases in advertising revenues generated from the automotive, food-grocery/other, and services sectors.  Excluding the stations acquired in 2013, automotive, which typically is our largest category, represented 25.1% of net time sales for the year ended December 31, 2013.     Net broadcast revenues increased  $272.6 million in 2012 when compared to 2011, of which $164.2 million was related to stations acquired during 2012. Additionally, revenues earned pursuant to the LMA with the Freedom stations during the first quarter of 2012 included $2.2 million for management services performed and $7.8 million of pass-through costs.  The remaining increase was due to increases in advertising revenues generated from the political, direct response and beer / wine sectors. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the internet, soft drinks, movies and drugs / cosmetic sectors. Excluding the stations acquired in 2012, automotive, which typically is our largest category, represented 20.3% of net time sales for the year ended December 31, 2012.     Political Revenues . Political revenues, which include time sales from political advertising, decreased by $85.1 million to $11.8 million for 2013 when compared to 2012. Political revenues increased by $88.6 million to $96.9 million for 2012 when compared to 2011.   Political revenues are typically higher in election years such as 2012 and 2010.  Accordingly, we expect political revenues to increase in 2014 from 2013 levels.     Local Revenues .  Excluding political revenues, our local broadcast revenues, which include local times sales, retransmission revenues and other local revenues, were up $311.0 million for 2013 when compared to 2012, of which $250.9 million related to the stations acquired in 2013. The remaining increase is due to an increase in advertising spending particularly in the automotive, services, and grocery/other sectors and an increase in retransmission revenues from MVPDs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease due to a decline in advertising revenues from the restaurants, schools and retail/department stores sectors. Excluding political revenues, our local broadcast revenues, which include local times sales, retransmission revenues and other local revenues, were up $144.8 million for 2012, compared to 2011, of which $112.1 million was related to the stations acquired in 2012. The remaining increase is due to an increase in advertising spending particularly in the automotive and direct response sectors and an increase in retransmission revenues from MVPDs. These increases were partially offset by declines in advertising revenues from the schools, fast food and services sectors and a change in networks for the Super Bowl programming from FOX to NBC as we had 20 FOX stations compared to one NBC station at the time when the Super Bowl aired in February 2012.     National Revenues.   O ur national broadcast revenues, excluding political revenues, which include national time sales and other national revenues, were up $71.0 million for 2013 when compared to 2012, of which $70.2 million related to the stations acquired in 2013.  The remaining increase was due to increases in advertising revenues generated from the automotive, media and restaurants sectors.  These increases were partially offset by a decline in advertising revenues in the fast food, other and movie sectors.  Excluding political revenues, our national broadcast revenues increased $39.2 million for 2012 when compared to 2011, of which $38.5 million related to the stations acquired in 2012.  The remaining increase was due to increases in advertising revenues generated from the direct response and services sectors.     52          Broadcast Expenses     The following table presents our significant operating expense categories for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions):                                                        Percent Change    (Increase/(Decrease))                          2013           2012           2011           13 vs. 12           12 vs. 11              Station production   expenses           $     385.1           $     255.5           $     178.6           50.7     %     43.1     %        Station selling,   general and administrative expenses           $     249.7           $     171.3           $     123.9           45.8     %     38.3     %        Amortization of   program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments           $     80.9           $     61.0           $     52.1           32.6     %     17.1     %        Corporate general   and administrative expenses           $     47.3           $     28.9           $     24.8           63.7     %     16.5     %        Impairment of   goodwill, intangible and other assets           $                $                $     0.4                      (100.0     )%        Depreciation and   amortization expenses           $     133.1           $     77.5           $     44.6           71.7     %     73.8     %           Station production expenses.   Station production expenses increased $129.6 million during 2013 compared to 2012, of which $107.2 million related to the stations acquired in 2013 and 2012. The remaining increases for the year were primarily due to  an  increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements and increased compensation expense, including incentive compensation.     Station production expenses increased $76.9 million during 2012 compared to 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements, increased compensation expense (including amounts related to the Four Points and Freedom stations pursuant to the LMAs prior to acquisition, which were pass-through costs), increased promotional advertising expenses and increased rating service fees due to annual scheduled rate increases.  Additionally, news profit share expenses increased due to better news performance which resulted in higher payments to our news share partners.     Station selling, general and administrative expenses.   Station selling, general and administrative expenses increased $78.4 million during 2013 compared to 2012, of which $75.4 million related to the stations acquired in 2013 and 2012. The remaining  increases for the year were primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, including incentive compensation, partially offset by lower national sales commissions.     Station selling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.4 million during 2012 compared to 2011, of which $38.4 million related to the stations acquired in 2012. The remaining  increases for the year were primarily due to an increase in national sales commissions and increased compensation expense, including incentive compensation.     Amortization of program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments.   The amortization of program contract costs increased $19.9 million during 2013 compared to 2012, of which $14.8 million related to the stations acquired in 2013 and 2012.  The remaining increase is due to higher programming costs.     The amortization of program contract costs increased $8.9 million during 2012 compared to 2011.  $7.1 million of this increase was due primarily to stations acquired in 2012. The remaining increase is due to higher programming costs.     Corporate general and administrative expenses.   See explanation under  Corporate and Unallocated Expenses     Impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets .  We completed our annual test of goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment in fourth quarter 2013, 2012 and 2011. We recorded no impairment in 2013 and 2012.  During 2011, we recorded impairments of $0.4 million related to our broadcast licenses.     Depreciation and amortization expenses.   Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangibles and other assets increased $55.6 million during 2013 compared 2012, of which $57.3 million related to the stations acquired in 2013 and 2012.  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $32.9 million during 2012 compared to 2011.  This increase was primarily due to stations being acquired in 2012.     53          OTHER OPERATING DIVISIONS REVENUE AND EXPENSE     The following table presents our other operating divisions revenue and expenses which is comprised of the following for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): Triangle Signs & Services, LLC (Triangle), a sign designer and fabricator; Alarm Funding Associates, LLC.

During 2013, we recorded income of $2.0 million related to certain private investment funds and a loss of $1.4 million related to our real estate ventures. During 2012, we recorded income of $2.2 million related to certain private investment funds and income of $7.4 million related to our real estate ventures, including a $7.9 million gain on the sale of three of our real estate ventures, partially offset by a $0.9 million impairment charge related to one of our real estate ventures.  During 2011, we recorded income of $2.3 million related to certain private equity funds and income of $1.0 million related to our real estate ventures, including a $1.1 million gain on sale of one of our real estate ventures.     CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED EXPENSES                                                        Percent Change    (Increase/(Decrease))                          2013           2012           2011           13 vs. 12           12 vs. 11              Corporate general   and administrative expenses           $     4.5           $     2.8           $     2.4           60.7     %     16.7     %        Interest expense           $     159.7           $     125.3           $     102.4           27.5     %     22.4     %        Loss from   extinguishment of debt           $     58.4           $     0.3           $     4.8           n/m           (93.8     )%        Income tax   provision            $     41.2           $     67.9           $     44.8           (39.3     )%     51.6     %           n/m  not meaningful     54             Corporate general and administrative expenses .  We allocate most of our corporate general and administrative expenses to the broadcast segment.  The explanation that follows combines corporate general and administrative expenses found in the  Broadcast Segment  section with the corporate general and administrative expenses found in this section,  Corporate and Unallocated Expenses .  These results exclude general and administrative costs from our other operating divisions segment which are included in our discussion of expenses in the  Other Operating Divisions Segment  section.     Combined corporate general and administrative expenses increased to $51.8 million in 2013 from $31.7 million in 2012.  This is primarily due to an increase in transaction costs due to our recent acquisitions, an increase in higher health insurance costs, due to increased employee headcount from acquisitions, and higher compensation expense, including incentive compensation.     Combined corporate general and administrative expenses increased to $31.7 million in 2012 from $27.2 million in 2011.  This is primarily due to an increase in transaction costs due to our recent acquisitions, an increase in higher health insurance costs and higher employee incentive / performance bonuses.     We expect corporate general and administrative expenses to increase in 2014 compared to 2013.     Interest expense.   Interest expense increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the issuance of $500 million of 6.125% Notes in the fourth quarter 2012, the incremental borrowings on our Term Loan A and Term Loan B under our Bank Credit Agreement for our acquisitions in 2013, the issuance of $600.0 million of 5.375% Notes in the second quarter of 2013, and the issuance of $350.0 million of 6.375% Notes in the fourth quarter of 2013. Interest expense was partially offset by a decrease due to the redemption of our 9.25% Notes, our 4.875% Notes and our 3.0% Notes in the fourth quarter of 2013.     Interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the incremental borrowings on our Term Loan A and Term Loan B under our Bank Credit Agreement for our acquisitions in 2012, the issuance of $500.0 million of 6.125% notes in the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as financing costs of $6.3 million related to the amendment of our Bank Credit Agreement, which were incurred in 2012.  The increase in interest was partially offset by a decrease due to the full extinguishment of our 6.0% Notes in the second quarter of 2011.     We expect interest expense to decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 when excluding the financing of pending acquisitions.     Loss from extinguishment of debt.   We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $59.4 million related to the amendments of our Bank Credit Agreement in April and October 2013 and redemption of 9.25% Notes in October 2013, partially offset by a $1.0 million gain on extinguishment from our 3.0% Notes, resulting in a $58.4 loss from extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2013.     During the year ended December 31, 2012, we drew down on our incremental borrowings under the Bank Credit Agreement and wrote off a portion of our deferred financing costs and debt discount on the Term Loan B, resulting in a loss of $0.3 million from extinguishment of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we amended our Bank Credit Agreement and paid down a portion of our Term Loan B, completed the redemption of all $70.0 million of the remaining 6.0% Notes and repurchased certain of our 8.375% Notes, resulting in a loss of $4.8 million from extinguishment of debt.     Income tax (provision) benefit.   The 2013 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the noncontrolling interest) of $103.2 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 40.0%.  The 2012 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the noncontrolling interest) of $212.1 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.0%.  The increase in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to the following items: 1) greater expenses of consolidated VIEs in 2013 that are treated as pass-through entities for income tax purposes; and 2) a 2012 release of valuation allowance of $7.7 million related to certain deferred tax assets of Cunningham, one of our consolidated VIEs, as the weight of all available evidence supports realization of the deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance release determination was based primarily on the sufficiency of forecasted taxable income necessary to utilize NOLs expiring in years 2022  2029.  This VIE files separate income tax returns.  Any resulting tax liabilities are nonrecourse to us and we are not entitled to any benefit resulting from the deferred tax assets of the VIE.     The 2012 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the non-controlling interest) of $212.1 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.0%.  The 2011 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the non-controlling interest) of $121.0 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.0%.  The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to the release of valuation allowance in 2012 of $7.7 million related to certain deferred tax assets of Cunningham, one of our consolidated VIEs, as discussed above.     As of December 31, 2013, we had a net deferred tax liability of $312.8 million as compared to a net deferred tax liability of $235.4 million as of December 31, 2012.  The increase primarily relates to an increase in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the 2013 stock acquisitions with greater book basis in intangible and fixed assets.     As of December 31, 2013, we had $16.9 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits.  Of this total, $15.6 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rates from      55          continuing operations.  As of December 31, 2012, we had $26.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits.  Of this total, $15.0 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) and $6.8 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rates from continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively. We recognized $1.2 million and $1.5 million of income tax expense for interest related to uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  See  Note 9. Income Taxes  in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     As of December 31, 2013, we had $280.1 million in cash and cash equivalent balances and net positive working capital of approximately $354.5 million.  Cash generated by our operations and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement are used as our primary sources of liquidity.  As of December 31, 2013, we had no amounts drawn on our Revolving Credit Facility and $154.5 million of borrowing capacity available.  We anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from our operations and borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility and general uncommitted incremental term loan capacity of $200.0 million under our Bank Credit Agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements and working capital needs for the next twelve months.  We anticipate raising additional funds for our pending acquisitions.  For our long-term liquidity needs, in addition to the sources described above, we may rely upon the issuance of long-term debt, the issuance of equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for equity, or the sale of non-core assets.  However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital or buyers of our non-core assets will be available, or that the terms of any transactions will be acceptable or advantageous to us.     On April 9, 2013, we entered into an amendment and restatement (the Amendment) of our Bank Credit Agreement.  Pursuant to the Amendment, we refinanced the existing facility and replaced the existing term loans under the facility with a new $500.0 million term loan A facility (Term Loan A), maturing April 2018 and priced at LIBOR plus 2.25%; and a $400.0 million term loan B facility (Term Loan B), maturing April 2020 and priced at LIBOR plus 2.25% with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%.  $445.0 million of the Term Loan A was drawn on a delayed basis in October 2013.     In addition, we replaced our existing revolving line of credit with a new $100.0 million revolving line of credit maturing April 2018 and priced at LIBOR plus 2.25%.  The proceeds from the term loans, along with cash on hand, was used to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.     In October 2013, we further amended certain terms of our Bank Credit Agreement.  Pursuant to this amendment, we increased the capacity of Term Loan A from $500 million to $700 million and increased the capacity of Term Loan B from $400 million to $650 million through an incremental Term Loan B loan of $250.0 million, which was drawn in October 2013. The incremental Term Loan B of $250.0 million was used to fund fourth quarter acquisitions, the redemption of the 9.25% Notes and for general corporate purposes. We also increased the capacity of our revolving line of credit from $100.0 million to $157.5 million maturing in April 2018.  Additional terms of the amendment are as follows:     ·                    We increased our ratio of our First Lien Indebtedness from 3.50 times EBITDA to 3.75 times EBITDA for the period January 1, 2015 through maturity of the agreement.  ·                    We increase our threshold for determining material third-party licensees from 5% to 10%  ·                    Other amended terms provided us with increased television station acquisition capacity, more flexibility under the other restrictive covenants and prepayments of the existing term loans.     In May 2013, we issued 18.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock for net proceeds of $472.9 million.  The net proceeds were used to fund acquisitions in the third quarter 2013.     In April 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 5.375% Notes, which bear interest at a rate of 5.375% per annum and mature on April 1, 2021, pursuant to an indenture dated April 2, 2013 (the 5.375% Indenture).  The 5.375% Notes were priced at 100% of their par value and interest is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, commencing on October 1, 2013.  Prior to April 1, 2016, we may redeem the 5.375% Notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 5.375% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the 5.375% Indenture.  Beginning on April 1, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the 5.375% Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price set forth in the 5.375% Indenture.  In addition, on or prior to April 1, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the 5.375% Notes using proceeds of certain equity offerings.  Upon the sale of certain of our assets or certain changes of control, the holders of the 5.375% Notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes.  The net proceeds from the offering of the 5.375% Notes were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under our bank credit facility.     In September 2013, 100% of the outstanding 4.875% Notes, representing aggregate principal of $5.7 million, were converted into 388,632 shares of Class A Common Stock, as permitted under the indenture, resulting in an increase in additional paid-in capital of $7.3     56          million, net of income taxes.     In October 2013, we issued $350.0 million in senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 6.375% Notes per annum and mature on November 1, 2021, pursuant to an indenture dated October 11, 2013 (the 6.375% Indenture). The 6.375% Notes were priced at 100% of their par value and interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2014. Prior to November 1, 2016, we may redeem the 6.375% Notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the 6.375% Indenture. In addition, on or prior to November 1, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the 6.375% Notes using the proceeds of certain equity offerings. Upon the sale of certain of our assets or certain changes of control, the holders of the 6.375% Notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes.  The proceeds from the offering of the 6.375% Notes were used to partially fund the redemption of the 9.25% Notes, as discussed further below.     Effective October 12, 2013, we redeemed all of the outstanding 9.25% Notes, representing $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount. Upon the redemption, along with the principal, we paid the accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium of $25.4 million, for a total of $546.1 million paid to noteholders. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of $43.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to this redemption.     In October 2013, 100% of the outstanding 3.0% Notes, representing aggregate principal of $5.4 million, were converted and settled fully in cash of $10.5 million, as permitted under the indenture.  As the original terms of the indenture included a cash conversion feature, the effective settlement of the liability and equity components were accounted for separately.  The redemption of the liability component to resulted in a $1.0 million gain on extinguishment, and the redemption of the equity component was recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital, net of taxes.     Sources and Uses of Cash     The following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions):                    2013           2012           2011              Net cash flows from   operating activities           $     160.6           $     237.5           $     148.5                                                                 Cash flows from   (used in) investing activities:                                                  Acquisition of   property and equipment           $     (43.4     )     $     (44.0     )     $     (35.8     )        Payments for   acquisitions of television stations           (1,006.1     )     (1,135.3     )                   Proceeds from the   sale of broadcast assets           49.7                                    Payments for   acquisitions of assets of other operating divisions           (4.7     )                              Purchase of alarm   monitoring contracts           (23.7     )     (12.5     )     (8.9     )        (Increase) decrease   in restricted cash           (11.5     )     58.5           (53.4     )        Investments in   equity and cost method investees           (10.8     )     (24.1     )     (11.6     )        Investment in   marketable securities           (11.6     )     (1.5     )     (4.9     )        Other, net           10.9           9.6           2.4              Net cash flows   (used in) from investing activities           $     (1,051.2     )     $     (1,149.3     )     $     (112.2     )                                                           Cash flows from   (used in) financing activities:                                                  Proceeds from notes   payable, commercial bank financing and capital leases           $     2,278.3           $     1,247.2           $     151.7              Repayments of notes   payable, commercial bank financing and capital leases           (1,509.8     )     (179.3     )     (150.4     )        Proceeds from the   sale of Class A Common Stock           472.9                                    Dividends paid on   Class A and Class B common stock           (56.8     )     (123.9     )     (38.4     )        Payments for   deferred financing costs           (27.7     )     (18.7     )     (5.5     )        Noncontrolling   distributions contributions           (10.3     )     (1.1     )     (0.6     )        Other, net           1.3           (2.5     )     (2.1     )        Net cash flows from   (used in) financing activities           $     1,147.9           $     921.7           $     (45.3     )           57          Operating Activities     Net cash flows from operating activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.   During 2013, we had higher program payments, higher  cash payments to vendors, and higher compensation expenses which are primarily due to our acquisitions since the same period in 2012, partially offset by higher cash receipts from customers.     Net cash flows from operating activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.   During 2012, we received more cash receipts from customers, net of cash payments to vendors, partially offset by higher interest and tax payments and the $25.0 million payments to FOX pursuant to the agreements entered into during the second quarter of 2012.     Investing Activities     Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. This increase is primarily due to $1,006.1 million in payments for acquisitions of television stations during 2013 compared to $1,135.3 million during 2012, the proceeds from sales of certain television stations during 2013, and lower investments in equity and cost investees.  This increase was partially offset by higher purchases of alarm monitoring contracts and an increase in restricted cash for pending acquisitions.     Net cash flows used in investing activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.  This increase is due to $1,135.3 million in payments for acquisitions of television stations, additional investment in equity investees, higher capital expenditures and the purchases of alarm monitoring contracts. This increase was partially offset by the use of the restricted cash held in escrow for our acquisitions and distributions received upon sale of three of our equity method investments during 2012.     In 2014, we anticipate incurring higher capital expenditures than incurred in 2013.     Financing Activities     Net cash flows from financing activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.  The increase is primarily due to issuing $600.0 million and $350.0 million of 5.375% and 6.375% Notes, respectively, and $250.0 million net proceeds from our Bank Credit Agreement, $472.9 proceeds received from our offering of Class A common stock, decreases in dividends paid from $1.54 per share during 2012 to $0.60 per share during 2013, and increases in loans by our consolidated variable interest entities.  This increase is partially offset by redemption of our 9.375% Notes and increased payments for deferred financing costs.     Net cash flows from financing activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.  During 2012, we drew $530.0 million of incremental term loans to fund the asset acquisitions of both Four Points and Freedom, which closed in January 2012 and April 2012, respectively.   We also issued $500.0 million of Senior Unsecured Notes  and used the proceeds to fund the acquisitions in the fourth quarter. This was slightly offset by higher stock dividends paid in 2012 totaling $1.54 per share, which included the $1.00 per share special dividend paid in December, versus $0.48 per share in 2011, as well as, $13.2 million more in payments for deferred financing costs related to the  incremental borrowings in 2012 .     During 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share in the months of February and May, which were paid in March and June, and $0.15 per share in the months of August and November, which were paid in September and December.  A special cash dividend of $1.00 per share was also declared in November 2012, which was paid in December, for total dividend payments of $1.54 per share for the year ended December 31, 2012.  During 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the months of February, April, August and November, which were paid in March, June, September and December, respectively, for total dividend payments of $0.60 per share for the year ended December 31, 2013.  In February 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.  Future dividends on our common shares, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on several factors including our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, covenant restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.  The Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock holders have the same rights related to dividends.  Under our Bank Credit Agreement, in certain circumstances, we may make up to $200.0 million in unrestricted annual cash payments including but not limited to dividends, of which $50.0 million may carry over to the next year.     Contractual Obligations     We have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed.  For example, we are contractually committed to acquire future programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.     The following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2013 and the future periods in which      58          such obligations are expected to be settled in cash (in millions):     CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS  (a)                    Total           2014           2015-2016           2017-2018           2019 and    thereafter (b)              Notes payable,   capital leases and commercial bank financing (c), (d)           $     3,829.2           $     155.9           $     423.7           $     874.5           $     2,375.1              Notes and capital   leases payable to affiliates (c)           32.0           4.5           8.5           6.0           13.0              Operating leases           86.2           13.3           22.8           19.2           30.9              Program content (e)           736.5           223.6           346.1           158.9           7.9              Programming   services (f)           101.6           42.9           29.9           19.7           9.1              LMA and outsourcing   agreements (g)           2.2           0.7           1.2           0.3                         Investments and   loan commitments (h)           17.0           17.0                                               Other (i)            34.5           4.7           6.5           5.6           17.7              Total contractual   cash obligations           $     4,839.2           $     462.6           $     838.7           $     1,084.2           $     2,453.8                  (a)     Excluded from this table are $16.9 million of accrued unrecognized tax benefits.  Due to inherent uncertainty, we cannot make reasonable estimates of the amount and period payments will be made.     (b)     Includes a one-year estimate of $8.9 million in payments related to contracts that automatically renew.  We have not calculated potential payments for years after 2019.     (c)     Includes interest on fixed rate debt and capital leases.  Estimated interest on our recourse variable rate debt has been excluded.  Recourse variable rate debt represents $1.2 billion of our $3.0 billion total face value of debt as of December 31, 2013.     (d)     During 2013 issued $600.0 million and $350.0 million of 5.375% and 6.375% Notes, and $250.0 million net proceeds from our Bank Credit Agreement. Additionally, during 2013, we redeemed $500.0 million of 9.25% Notes, $5.4 million of 3% Notes, and $5.7 million of 4.875% Notes.  Also, included in these amounts are $55.6 million of debt of our variable interest entities.     (e)     Our Program content includes contractual amounts owed through the expiration date of the underlying agreement for active and future program contracts, network programming and additional advertising inventory in various dayparts. Active program contracts are included in the balance sheet as an asset and liability while future program contracts are excluded until the cost is known, the program is available for its first showing or telecast and the licensee has accepted the program.  Industry protocol typically enables us to make payments for program contracts on a three-month lag, which differs from the contractual timing within the table.  Network programming agreements may include variable fee components such as subscriber levels, which in certain circumstances have been estimated and reflected in the table.     (f)      Includes obligations related to rating service fees, music license fees, market research, weather and news services.     (g)     Excluded from the table are estimated amounts due pursuant to LMAs and outsourcing agreements where we consolidate the counterparty. The fees that we are required to pay under these agreements total $6.9 million, $10.9 million, $2.9 million and $4.1 million for the periods 2014, 2015-2016, 2017-2018 and 2019 and thereafter, respectively. Certain station related operating expenses are paid by the licensee and reimbursed by us under the LMA agreements. Certain of these expenses that are in connection with contracts are included in table above.     (h)     Commitments to contribute capital or provide loans to Allegiance Capital, LP, Sterling Ventures Partners, LP, Patriot Capital II, LP and Patriot III, LP.     (i)      Other includes obligations post-retirement benefits, maintenance and support, other corporate contracts and other long term liabilities.     Off Balance Sheet Arrangements     Off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the SEC means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party, under which the registrant has:  obligations under certain guarantees or contracts; retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements; obligations under certain derivative arrangements; and obligations arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. As of December 31, 2013, we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.     59          ITEM 7A.                                         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates.  At times we enter into derivative instruments primarily for the purpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt.  See  Note 6. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing,  in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  As of December 31, 2013, we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments.     We are exposed to risk from the changing interest rates of our variable rate debt, primarily related to our Bank Credit Agreement.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, interest expense on our term loans and revolver related to our Bank Credit Agreement was $27.3 million.  We estimate that adding 1.0% to respective interest rates would result in an increase in our interest expense of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.  We also have $86.3 million of variable rate debt associated with our other operating divisions.  We estimate that adding 1.0% to respective interest rates would result in $0.7 million of additional interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013.  Our consolidated VIEs have $55.6 million of variable rate debt associated with the stations that we provide services to pursuant to LMAs and other outsourcing arrangements..  We estimate that adding 1.0% to respective interest rates would an increase interest expense of the VIEs by $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.     ITEM 8.                                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
