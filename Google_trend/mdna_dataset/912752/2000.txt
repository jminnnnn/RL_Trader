ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  INTRODUCTION       We are a diversified broadcasting company that owns or provides programming services pursuant to LMAs to more television  stations than any other commercial broadcasting  group the United States. We currently own, or provide  programming services  pursuant to LMAs to, 61  television  stations  and 11 radio  stations. During 1999, we sold the majority of our radio stations and we have entered into agreements  to sell or intend to enter into to sell in the future our  remaining radio stations. In addition,  we own equity interests in three  Internet-related companies.       Our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and, to a much lesser extent,  from  political  advertisers  and  television  network compensation. Our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward and revenues from national  advertisers  have  continued to trend  downward when measured as a percentage of local  broadcast  revenue.  We believe this trend is primarily  resulting  from an increase in the number of media outlets  providing national advertisers a means by which to advertise their goods or services.  Our efforts to mitigate this trend include  continuing our efforts to increase local revenues  and  the  development  of  innovative  marketing  strategies  to  sell traditional and non-traditional services to national advertisers.       Our primary operating expenses involved in owning, operating or programming the  television   and  radio  stations  are  syndicated   program  rights  fees, commissions  on revenues,  employee  salaries,  and  news-gathering  and station promotional  costs.  Amortization  and depreciation of costs associated with the acquisition  of the  stations  and  interest  carrying  charges are  significant factors in determining our overall profitability.                                         28         Set forth below are the principal types of broadcast  revenues  received by our stations for the periods  indicated and the percentage  contribution of each type to our total gross broadcast revenues:                                  BROADCAST REVENUE                              (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                                                                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             1997                       1998                        1999                                   ------------------------   ------------------------   --------------------------              Local/regional advertising.....    $ 226,136        47.6%     $ 317,285        48.4%     $  397,047         51.1% National advertising ..........      241,320        50.8%       296,864        45.3%        354,257         45.6% Network compensation ..........        5,136         1.1%        18,203         2.8%         19,186          2.5% Political advertising .........          934         0.2%        20,422         3.1%          3,157          0.4% Production ....................        1,239         0.3%         2,617         0.4%          3,530          0.4%                                    ---------       -----      ---------       -----      ----------        ----- Broadcast revenues ............      474,765       100.0%       655,391       100.0%        777,177        100.0%                                                    =====                      =====                        ===== Less: agency commissions.......

Similarly,  our  four  largest  categories  of advertising  and their  approximate  percentages of 1999 net broadcast  revenues were automotive (22.0%), fast food advertising (8.0%),  retail/department stores (7.0%) and professional services (5.6%). No other advertising category accounted for more than 5% of our net broadcast revenues in 1999. No individual advertiser accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated net broadcast revenues in 1999.

The  increase  in net  broadcast  revenue  for the year  ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1998  comprised of $106.9 million  related to businesses  acquired or disposed of by us in 1998 and 1999  (collectively  the 1998 and 1999  Transactions)  offset by a $1.3  million decrease in net broadcast revenues on a same station basis,  representing a 0.3% decrease over prior year's net broadcast  revenue for these stations.  On a same station basis,  revenues were  negatively  impacted by a decrease in revenues in the Raleigh,  Norfolk and Sacramento  markets.  Our  television  stations in the Raleigh and Norfolk markets  experienced a decrease in ratings which resulted in a loss in revenues and market  revenue share  primarily due to the loss of their affiliation  agreements  with Fox,  which  expired  on August 31,  1998.  In the Sacramento  market,  revenues  decreased for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the same period in 1998 due to the absence of political  and olympic revenues experienced during 1998.       On a same station basis, our national revenues decreased approximately 4.0% and our local  revenues  increased  approximately  4.2%. Our revenues from local advertisers   have   continued  to  trend  upward  and  revenues  from  national advertisers  have  continued to trend  downward when measured as a percentage of local broadcast  revenue.  We believe this trend is primarily  resulting from an increase in the number of media outlets providing  national  advertisers a means by which to advertise their goods or services.       Total  operating  costs  increased  $62.8 million to $283.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $220.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, or 28.5%.  The increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1998 comprised of $55.4 million related to the 1998 and 1999  Transactions,  $2.4 million related to an increase in  corporate  overhead  expenses,  and $5.0  million  related to an increase in operating costs on a same station basis, representing a 3.5% increase over prior year's  operating costs for those stations.  The increase in corporate  overhead expenses  for the year  ended  December  31,  1999  primarily  resulted  from an increase  in legal fees and an  increase  in salary  costs  incurred to manage a larger base of  operations.  The increase in  operating  costs on a same station basis  primarily  resulted  from  costs  incurred  during  1999  related  to our agreements  with the Fox and WB networks  which were not  incurred in 1998.  Our payments to the Fox network  related to the  purchase of  additional  prime time inventory and our payments to the WB network  related to our agreement  with the network  which  requires us to make payments as ratings  increase.  We expect to incur these costs in future periods. In addition,  we experienced an increase in commissions  due to a larger number of local account  executives.  The increased number of account  executives is part of our strategy to increase the percentage of our revenues  derived from local  advertising  and we expect this to increase further in 2000 as we add additional account  executives.  See "Item 1. Business - -- Television Broadcasting (Innovative Local Sales and Marketing)".       Depreciation and amortization increased $47.4 million to $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $177.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase in depreciation and amortization  related to fixed asset, intangible  asset,  and program  contract  additions  associated with businesses acquired during 1998 and 1999.       Interest  expense  increased  $39.3 million to $178.3  million for the year ended  December  31, 1999 from $139.0  million for the year ended  December  31, 1998, or 28.3%. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1998  primarily  resulted  from higher interest  expense  related to  acquisitions  closed in the second half of 1998 and a high  applicable  interest rate margin for  borrowing  under our bank credit  agreement.  Subsidiary trust minority  interest expense of $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 is related to the private  placement of the $200  million  aggregate  liquidation  value 11 5/8 % high yield  trust  offered preferred securities (the HYTOPS) completed March 12, 1997.       Interest  and other  income  decreased  to $3.5  million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $6.7 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998.  This decrease was  primarily  due to the decrease in the average cash balance  during the 1999 fiscal year as compared to the same period in 1998.                                         31         Net income for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $167.8 million or $1.63 per share  compared  to a net loss of $16.9  million  or $0.29 per share for the year  ended  December  31,  1998.  The  change in net  income for the year ended December  31, 1999 as compared to the net loss for the year ended  December  31, 1998 was primarily due to the gain on the sale of radio broadcast assets related to discontinued  operations.  In addition, the change in net income for the year ended  December 31, 1999 as compared to the net loss for the year ended December 31, 1998 was also  attributable  to the  recognition of an unrealized  gain on a treasury  option  derivative  instrument,  offset  by an  increase  in  interest expense.       As noted  above,  our net  income  for the year  ended  December  31,  1999 included recognition of an unrealized gain of $15.7 million on a treasury option derivative  instrument.   Upon  execution  of  the  treasury  option  derivative instrument,  we received a cash payment of $9.5  million.  The  treasury  option derivative  instrument will require us to make five annual payments equal to the difference  between  6.14% minus the interest  rate yield on five-year  treasury securities on September 30, 2000 times the $300 million  notional  amount of the instrument.  If the yield on  five-year  treasuries  is equal to or greater than 6.14% on September  30, 2000,  we will not be required to make any payment under the terms of this  instrument.  If the rate is below 6.14% on that date, we will be required to make payments,  as described  above,  and the size of the payment will increase as the rate goes down.  Each year, we recognize  income or expense equal to the change in the projected  liability under this arrangement  based on interest  rates at the end of the year. If the yield on five-year  treasuries at September 30, 2000 were to equal the two year forward five year treasury rate on December 31, 1999 for treasuries  settled on September 30, 2000, we would not be required to make payments.       Broadcast cash flow increased  $27.0 million to $332.3 million for the year ended  December  31, 1999 from $305.3  million for the year ended  December  31, 1998, or 8.8%.  The increase in broadcast  cash flow for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1998 was comprised of $36.0 million  related  to the 1998 and 1999  Transactions  offset  by a $9.0  million decrease in broadcast  cash flow on a same station  basis,  representing  a 4.1% decrease over prior year's broadcast cash flow for those stations. This decrease in  broadcast  cash flow on a same  station  basis  primarily  resulted  from an increase in operating expenses and film payments combined with a slight decrease in net broadcast revenues. Our broadcast cash flow margin decreased to 49.6% for the year ended  December  31,  1999 from 54.1% for the year ended  December  31, 1998. On a same station basis,  broadcast cash flow margin  decreased from 52.9% for the year ended  December  31, 1998 to 50.9% for the year ended  December 31, 1999. The decrease in broadcast cash flow margin for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily  resulted from an increase in operating expenses and film payments combined with a slight decrease in net broadcast revenues.       Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  broadcast cash flow less corporate  expenses. Adjusted  EBITDA  increased  $24.6 million to $313.3  million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $288.7  million for the year ended  December 31, 1998, or 8.5%.  The increase in adjusted  EBITDA for the year ended  December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1998  resulted  from the 1998 and 1999 Transactions  offset by a $2.4 million increase in corporate  overhead expenses, as described  above.  Our adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 46.7% for the year ended  December 31, 1999 from 51.1% for the year ended  December 31, 1998.  This decrease in adjusted  EBITDA margin  resulted  primarily from the  circumstances affecting  broadcast  cash flow margins as noted above combined with an increase in corporate expenses.       After tax cash flow decreased  $12.6 million to $137.2 million for the year ended  December  31, 1999 from $149.8  million for the year ended  December  31, 1998, or 8.4%.  The decrease in after tax cash flow for the year ended  December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily resulted from an increase in interest expense offset by a net increase in broadcast  operating income relating to the 1998 and 1999 Transactions.  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1997       Net broadcast  revenue  increased  $157.3 million to $564.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $407.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997,  or 38.6%.  The  increase  in net  broadcast  revenue  for the year  ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997                                         32    comprised of $152.6 million related to businesses  acquired or disposed of by us in 1998 (the 1998  Transactions)  and $4.7 million  resulted from an increase in net broadcast  revenues on a same station  basis,  representing  a 1.2% increase over prior year's net broadcast  revenue for these  stations.  On a same station basis,  revenues  were  negatively  impacted  by a decrease  in  revenues in the Baltimore,  Milwaukee,  Norfolk and Raleigh markets.  Our television stations in these  markets  experienced  a decrease in ratings  which  resulted in a loss in revenues  and market  revenue  share.  In the  Raleigh  and  Norfolk  television markets,  our  affiliation  agreements with Fox expired on August 31, 1998 which further  contributed  to a decrease in ratings and  revenues.  In the  Baltimore market, the addition of a new UPN affiliate competitor  contributed to a loss in ratings and market revenue share. An additional factor which negatively impacted station  revenues  for the  year  was the  loss of  General  Motors  advertising revenues  caused by a strike of its employees.  These  decreases in revenue on a same  station  basis  were  offset by  revenue  growth at  certain  of our other television  stations combined with an increase in network  compensation  revenue and political advertising revenue.       Total  operating  costs  increased  $66.6 million to $220.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $153.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997, or 43.3%.  The increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1997 comprised of $64.3 million related  to the 1998  Transactions,  $4.2  million  related  to an  increase  in corporate  overhead  expenses,  and  $2.3  million  related  to an  increase  in operating costs on a same station basis, representing a 1.7% increase over prior year's  operating costs for those stations.  The increase in corporate  overhead expenses  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998  primarily  resulted  from an increase  in legal fees and an  increase  in salary  costs  incurred to manage a larger base of operations.       Depreciation and amortization increased $39.9 million to $177.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1997, or 29.1%.  The increase in depreciation  and  amortization  related to fixed asset and intangible asset additions  associated with businesses  acquired during 1997 and 1998.       Broadcast  operating  income  increased $50.6 million to $169.7 million for the year  ended  December  31,  1998,  from  $119.1  million  for the year ended December 31, 1997, or 42.5%. The net increase in broadcast  operating income for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 was primarily attributable to the 1998 Transactions.       Interest  expense  increased  $40.6 million to $139.0  million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997, or 41.3%.  The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily  related to indebtedness  incurred by us to finance the  Acquisitions. Subsidiary  trust minority  interest expense of $23.3 million for the year ended December  31,  1998 is  related to the  private  placement  of the $200  million aggregate liquidation value 115/8% high yield trust offered preferred securities (HYTOPS)  completed  March 12, 1997.  The increase in subsidiary  trust minority interest  expense for the year ended  December  31, 1998 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1997 related to the HYTOPS being  outstanding  for a partial period during 1997.       Interest  and other  income  increased  to $6.7  million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $2.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  This increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances during these periods. However,  cash  balances  were lower at December  31, 1998 than at December  31, 1997.       Net loss for the year ended  December  31, 1998 was $16.9  million or $0.29 per share  compared to net loss of $10.6 million or $0.19 per share for the year ended December 31, 1997. Net loss increased for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1997 due to an increase in operating expenses,  depreciation and  amortization,  interest  expense,  subsidiary trust minority interest expense, the recognition of an unrealized loss of $9.1 million on a derivative  instrument and the recognition of an extraordinary  loss offset by an increase in total revenues,  a gain on the sale of broadcast assets and an increase in interest and other income.  Our extraordinary  loss of $11.1 million net of a related tax benefit of $7.4 million resulted from the write-off of debt acquisition costs associated with indebtedness  replaced by the 1998 bank credit agreement.                                         33         As noted above,  our net loss for the year ended December 31, 1998 included recognition  of  a  loss  of  $9.1  million  on  a  treasury  option  derivative instrument.  Upon execution of the treasury  option  derivative  instrument,  we received  a cash  payment  of  $9.5  million.  The  treasury  option  derivative instrument  will require us to make five annual payments equal to the difference between 6.14% minus the interest rate yield on five-year treasury  securities on September 30, 2000 times the $300 million notional amount of the instrument.  If the yield on five-year treasuries is equal to or greater than 6.14% on September 30,  2000,  we will not be required to make any payment  under the terms of this instrument. If the rate is below 6.14% on that date, we will be required to make payments,  as described  above, and the size of the payment will increase as the rate goes down.  Each year,  we recognize an expense  equal to the change in the projected liability under this arrangement based on interest rates at the end of the year.  The loss  recognized in the year ended  December 31, 1998 reflects an adjustment of our liability under this instrument to the present value of future payments based on the two-year  forward  five-year  treasury rate as of December 31, 1998.  If the yield on five-year  treasuries  at September  30, 2000 were to equal the two year forward five year  treasury rate on December 31, 1998 (4.6%), we would be required to make five annual payments of approximately  $4.6 million each. If the yield on five-year  treasuries  declines  further in periods before September  30, 2000,  we will be required to recognize  further  losses.  In any event, we will not be required to make any payments until September 30, 2000.       Broadcast cash flow increased  $83.7 million to $305.3 million for the year ended  December  31, 1998 from $221.6  million for the year ended  December  31, 1997, or 37.8%.  The increase in broadcast cash flow for the year ended December 31, 1998 as  compared to the year ended  December  31, 1997  comprised  of $86.7 million related to the 1998  Transactions  offset by a $3.0 million  decrease in broadcast cash flow on a same station  basis,  representing a 1.4% decrease over prior year's  broadcast cash flow for those stations.  The decrease in broadcast cash flow primarily related to an increase in film payments.  Our broadcast cash flow margin  decreased to 54.1% for the year ended  December 31, 1998 from 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decrease in broadcast cash flow margin for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1998  primarily  resulted  from an increase  in film  payments  combined  with a disproportionate  increase in net broadcast  revenue.  On a same station  basis, broadcast cash flow margin  decreased from 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 1997 to 53.0% for the year ended December 31, 1998.       Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  broadcast cash flow less corporate  expenses. Adjusted  EBITDA  increased  $79.5 million to $288.7  million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $209.2  million for the year ended  December 31, 1997, or 38.0%.  The increase in adjusted  EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 resulted from the 1998 Transactions offset by a $4.2 million increase in corporate overhead  expenses,  as described above. Our adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 51.1% for the year ended December 31,  1998 from 51.4% for the year ended  December  31,  1997.  This  decrease in adjusted  EBITDA margin  resulted  primarily  from the  circumstances  affecting broadcast  cash  flow  margins  as noted  above  combined  with an  increase  in corporate expenses.       After tax cash flow increased  $44.9 million to $149.8 million for the year ended  December  31, 1998 from $104.9  million for the year ended  December  31, 1997, or 42.8%.  The increase in after tax cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 primarily resulted from a net increase in broadcast  operating income relating to the 1998  Transactions offset by an increase in interest expense and subsidiary trust minority interest expense relating to the HYTOPS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Our  primary  source  of  liquidity  is cash  provided  by  operations  and availability  under our 1998 bank credit agreement.  As of December 31, 1999, we had $16.4  million in cash  balances and excluding the effect of assets held for sale,  broadcast  assets  related to  discontinued  operations  and income taxes payable,  working capital of approximately  $44.5 million. As of March 15, 2000, the remaining  balance  available under the revolving credit facility was $650.0 million.  Based on pro forma  trailing  cash flow  levels for the twelve  months ended December 31, 1999, we had approximately $224.2 million available of                                         34    current  borrowing  capacity under our revolving credit facility.  Our 1998 bank credit  agreement also provides for an incremental  term loan  commitment in the amount of up to $400 million  which can be utilized  upon  approval by the agent bank and the raising of sufficient commitments from banks to fund the additional loans.       In July 1999,  we entered into an  agreement  to sell 46 radio  stations in nine  markets  to  Entercom  Communications  Corporation  (Entercom)  for $824.5 million in cash. The transaction  does not include our radio stations in the St. Louis  market which are subject to the St. Louis  purchase  option.  In December 1999, we closed on the sale of 41 radio stations in eight markets for a purchase price of $700.4  million.  We expect to close on the  remaining  $124.1  million during  2000 which  represents  the Kansas  City radio  stations  and WKRF-FM in Wilkes-Barre.  The  completion of the Kansas City  transaction is subject to FCC and  Department  of  Justice  approval.   The  completion  of  the  Wilkes-Barre transaction  is  subject  only  to FCC  approval  and  the  outcome  of  pending litigation  in which a former  licensee  is seeking  the  return of the  WKRF-FM license based on a fraudulent conveyance claim.       On April 19, 1999, we entered into an agreement  (the ATC  Agreement)  with American  Tower  Corporation,  an independent  owner,  operator and developer of broadcast  and  wireless  communication  sites in the United  States.  Under the agreement,  we would provide American Tower access to tower sites in a number of our markets  including  Nashville,  TN, Dayton,  OH, Richmond,  VA, Mobile,  AL, Pensacola, FL, San Antonio, TX, and Syracuse, NY. American Tower would construct new towers in each of these  markets  and would lease space on the towers to us. This is expected to provide us the additional tower capacity required to develop its digital television transmission needs in these markets at an initial capital outlay lower than would be required if we  constructed  these towers  ourselves. The form of the master lease has been  completed  and agreed to;  however,  each market is subject to individual  negotiations  on terms specific to that market, which are still being negotiated with American Tower  Corporation.  If we cannot agree with American Tower on the terms and  conditions of the individual  market leases,  neither  party  will have any  obligation  to the  other  under the ATC Agreement, which will then become a nullity.       Net cash flows from  operating  activities  decreased to $130.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $150.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily as a result of the increase in program contract payments.  We made  payments of interest on  outstanding  indebtedness  and  subsidiary  trust minority interest expense totaling $227.2 million during the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $140.9  million for the year ended  December  31,  1998. Program rights  payments for the year ended  December 31, 1999  increased  $18.4 million or 30.1%.  This  increase in program  rights  payments was  comprised of $15.7 million related to the 1998 and 1999 Transactions and $2.7 million related to an increase in  programming  costs on a same  station  basis which  increased 4.9%.       Net cash flows from  investing  activities  was $453.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to net cash flows used in investing  activities of $1.8  billion  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998.  For the year  ended December 31, 1999, we made cash payments of approximately $237.3 million related to the  acquisition  of  television  and radio  broadcast  assets  primarily  by utilizing  available  indebtedness  under our 1998 bank credit agreement.  These payments  included  $118.6  million  related  to  the  April  1999  Guy  Gannett acquisition,  $83.6  million  related to the July 1999 Guy Gannett  acquisition, $14.1  million  related to the St. Louis Radio  acquisition,  and $21.0  million related to other acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 1999, we received approximately  $733.9  million of cash  proceeds  related to the sale of certain television  and radio  broadcast  assets which was  primarily  utilized to repay indebtedness under the 1998 bank credit agreement.  These cash proceeds included $674.1 million related to the Entercom disposition, $23.7 million related to the Barnstable disposition,  $35.9 million related to the CCA disposition,  and $0.2 million related to other dispositions.  During the year ended December 31, 1999, we made equity interest  investments of approximately  $14.2 million,  including $7.6 million  related to an investment in Acrodyne,  $2.4 million  related to an investment in Allegiance Capital Limited Partnership, $2.2 million related to an investment  in  BeautyBuys.com,  and $2.0 million  related to an  investment  in Tuscaloosa  Tower.  We made payments for property and equipment of $30.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1999. In addition,  we  anticipate  that future requirements for capital                                         35    expenditures  will include  capital  expenditures  incurred  during the ordinary course of business and  additional  strategic  station  acquisitions  and equity investments if suitable investments can be identified on acceptable terms.       Net cash flows used in financing activities was $570.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to net cash flows from financing  activities of $1.5  billion  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998.  During  the year ended December  31,  1999,  we  repaid  $857.5  million  and $50.0  million  under the revolving  credit  facility and term loan  facility  components of the 1998 bank credit  agreement,  respectively,  primarily  from proceeds of the sale of radio stations.  In  addition,  we  utilized  borrowings  under the  revolving  credit facility of $357.5 million primarily to fund acquisition  activity including the Guy Gannett acquisition. During 1999 and as of December 31, 1999, we repurchased and retired  320,000 shares of our class A common stock for  approximately  $3.5 million.  During  2000 and as of March 24,  2000,  we  repurchased  and  retired 3,460,066 shares of our class A common stock for aproximately $32.7 million.                                                   36    INCOME TAXES       The income tax  provision  increased  to $174.9  million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from a provision of $45.7 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998.  For the year ended  December 31, 1999,  the provision for  continuing operations  and  discontinued  operations  is $25.1  million and $149.8  million respectively. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the provision for continuing operations and discontinuing operations is $32.6 and $13.1 million respectively. For 1999, our pre-tax book loss from continuing operations was $17.0 million and we recorded a tax expense of $25.1  million.  We recognized  this provision on a pre-tax loss because our  non-deductible tax items were in excess of the pre-tax loss and these items caused continuing  operations to have taxable income. These non-deductible  tax  items  primarily   consisted  of  non-deductible   goodwill associated with stock acquisitions.       As of December  31, 1999,  we have a net  deferred tax  liability of $228.7 million as compared to a net  deferred  tax  liability  of $165.5  million as of December 31, 1998.  The  increase in net  deferred tax  liability  from the year ended December 31, 1998 to the year ended December 31, 1999 is due to the use of federal and state net operating losses and alternative  minimum tax credits as a result of the sale of radio assets.  Additionally,  accelerated tax depreciation and  amortization of fixed and intangible  assets  contributed to an increase in deferred tax liabilities.       The income tax  provision  increased  to $45.7  million  for the year ended December 31, 1998 from a provision of $16.0 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997. Our effective tax rate increased to 511.9% for the year ended December 31, 1998 from 302.0% for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1997 primarily  resulted from an increase in  non-deductible tax items including the deferred tax liability related to the HYTOPS transaction and non-deductible goodwill related to stock acquisitions.  SEASONALITY       Our results usually are subject to seasonal  fluctuations,  which result in fourth  quarter  broadcast  operating  income being greater  usually than first, second  and third  quarter  broadcast  operating  income.  This  seasonality  is primarily  attributable to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season spending and an increase in viewership  during this period. In addition, revenues from political advertising tend to be higher in even numbered years.  YEAR 2000       We spent  approximately  $2.5  million  over the  past two  years  updating hardware and software systems to ensure Year 2000 compliance. The four phases of our Year 2000 plan  consisted  of:  inventory  and data  collection;  compliance requests;  test fix and verify;  final testing and new item compliance.  Each of the four phases of our Year 2000 process have been successfully completed and no disruptions to operations occurred as a result of Year 2000.       Although we have completed all phases of our Year 2000  compliance  project and currently  believe all of our systems to be Year 2000  compliant,  we cannot assure you that any of our systems will be Year 2000  compliant in future dates. In addition, we cannot assure you that outside systems indirectly related to our operations  are Year 2000  compliant  or will be Year 2000  compliant  in future dates.  RISK FACTORS       We believe  that our future  operating  results  and funds  generated  from operations  and available  under our credit  facility will be sufficient to meet general  corporate   requirements  and  planned  capital  expenditures  for  the foreseeable  future.  However,  we  cannot  identify  nor  can  we  control  all circumstances  that could  occur in the  future  that may  adversely  affect our business and results of operations. Some of the circumstances that may occur and may  impair  our  business  are  described   below.  If  any  of  the  following circumstances  were  to  occur,  our  business  could  be  materially  adversely affected.                                         37    OUR  SUBSTANTIAL  INDEBTEDNESS  COULD  ADVERSELY  AFFECT OUR  OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL OUR OBLIGATIONS TO YOU.       We  have  a  high  level  of  debt  and  other   obligations   compared  to stockholders' equity. Our obligations include the following:       Indebtedness  under the bank credit agreement.  As of December 31, 1999, we      owed  $1,003  million  under  our bank  credit  agreement  and had a $650.0      million remaining balance available.  Based on pro forma trailing cash flow      levels for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, we had  approximately      $224.2  million  available  of current  borrowing  capacity  under our bank      credit agreement.       Indebtedness  under notes. We have issued and  outstanding  three series of      senior  subordinated  notes. The total amount outstanding under these notes      as of December 31, 1999 was $750.0 million.       Obligations under High Yield Trust Offered Preferred  Securities  (HYTOPS).      Sinclair Capital,  a subsidiary trust of Sinclair,  has issued $200 million      aggregate  liquidation  amount of HYTOPS.  "Aggregate  liquidation  amount"      means the amount  Sinclair  Capital must pay to the holders when it redeems      the HYTOPS or upon liquidation.  Sinclair Capital must redeem the HYTOPS in      2009. We are indirectly liable for the HYTOPS obligations because we issued      $206.2  million  liquidation  amount of series C  preferred  stock to KDSM,      Inc.,  our wholly  owned  subsidiary,  to support  $200  million  aggregate      principal  amount of 11 5/8%  notes  that  KDSM,  Inc.  issued to  Sinclair      Capital to support the HYTOPS.       Series D Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock. We have issued 3,450,000      shares  of  series  D  convertible  exchangeable  preferred  stock  with an      aggregate  liquidation  preference of  approximately  $172.5  million.  The      liquidation  preference  means we would be  required  to pay the  holder of      series D convertible  exchangeable preferred stock $172.5 million before we      paid  holders  of common  stock (or any other  stock  that is junior to the      series D convertible  exchangeable  preferred  stock) in any liquidation of      Sinclair.  We are  not  obligated  to buy  back  or  retire  the  series  D      convertible  exchangeable  preferred  stock,  but  may do so at our  option      beginning  in 2000 at a  conversion  rate of  $22.8125  per share.  In some      circumstances,  we may also exchange the series D convertible  exchangeable      preferred stock for 6%  subordinated  debentures due 2012 with an aggregate      principal amount of $172.5 million.       Program  Contracts  Payable  and  Programming  Commitments.  We enter  into      contracts to purchase future  programming.  Under these contracts,  we were      obligated  on December  31, 1999 to make future  payments  totaling  $176.1      million.       Our relatively  high level of debt poses the following  risks to you and to Sinclair:       o    We use a  significant  portion of our cash flow to pay  principal  and           interest on our  outstanding  debt and to pay  dividends  on preferred           stock.  This will limit the amount  available for other purposes.  For           the year ended  December 31, 1999,  we would have been required to pay           $159.7 million in interest and preferred dividends (including dividend           payments  on  the  HYTOPS)  if  all of  our  material  securities  and           acquisition  and  divestiture   transactions   during  1999  had  been           completed as of January 1, 1999.       o    Our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for           future  working  capital  needs,  additional  acquisitions,  or  other           purposes.       o    The interest rate under our bank credit  agreement is a floating rate,           and will  increase  if  general  interest  rates  increase.  This will           increase  the  portion of our cash flow that must be spent on interest           payments.       o    We may be more  vulnerable to adverse  economic  conditions  than less           leveraged  competitors  and thus  less able to  withstand  competitive           pressures.                                         38         o    If our cash  flow  were  inadequate  to make  interest  and  principal           payments,  we might have to refinance our  indebtedness or sell one or           more of our stations to reduce debt service obligations.       Any of these effects could reduce the trading value of our securities.  OUR FLEXIBILITY IS LIMITED BY PROMISES WE HAVE MADE TO OUR LENDERS.       Our existing  financing  agreements  prevent us from taking certain actions and require us to meet certain tests.  These  restrictions and tests include the following:            o    Restrictions on additional debt,            o    Restrictions  on our ability to pledge our assets as security for                our indebtedness,            o    Restrictions on payment of dividends, the repurchase of stock and                other payments relating to capital stock,            o    Restrictions  on some sales of assets and the use of  proceeds of                asset sales,            o    Restrictions on mergers and other  acquisitions,  satisfaction of                conditions for  acquisitions,  and a limit on the total amount of                acquisitions without consent of bank lenders,            o    Restrictions  on the type of businesses  we and our  subsidiaries                may be in,            o    Restrictions  on  type  and  amounts  of  investments  we and our                subsidiaries may make, and            o    Financial  ratio  and  condition  tests  including  the  ratio of                earnings before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization                (EBITDA)  to total  interest  expense,  the  ratio of  EBITDA  to                certain of our fixed  expenses,  and the ratio of indebtedness to                EBITDA.       Future  financing  arrangements  may contain  additional  restrictions  and tests. These restrictions and tests may prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our  securities,  or may require actions that decrease the value of  securities.  In  addition,  we may fail to meet the tests and  thereby default on one or more of our  obligations.  If we  default on our  obligations, creditors  could require  immediate  payment of the  obligations or foreclose on collateral.  If this  happened,  we could be forced to sell assets or take other action that would reduce the value of our securities.  KEY OFFICERS AND  DIRECTORS  HAVE  FINANCIAL  INTERESTS  THAT ARE  DIFFERENT AND SOMETIMES OPPOSITE TO THOSE OF SINCLAIR.       Some of our officers and  directors own stock or  partnership  interests in businesses  that engage in  television  broadcasting,  do  business  with us, or otherwise  do  business  that  conflicts  with our  interests.  David D.  Smith, Frederick  G.  Smith,  and J. Duncan  Smith are each an officer and  director of Sinclair, and Robert E. Smith is a director. Together, the Smiths hold shares of our stock that have a majority  of the voting  power.  The Smiths own a business that operates a television station in St. Petersburg,  Florida.  The Smiths also own businesses  that lease real property and tower space to us, buy  advertising time from us, and engage in other  transactions with us. In addition,  relatives of the Smiths  hold a majority  of the equity,  but not the voting  control,  of Glencairn,  Ltd.  Glencairn  holds the licenses for television  stations that we program under local marketing agreements with Glencairn.       Maryland  law and our  financing  agreements  limit the extent to which our officers,  directors and majority stockholders may transact business with us and pursue business  opportunities that Sinclair might pursue.  These limitations do not, however, prohibit all such transactions.  Officers,  directors and majority stockholders  may therefore  transact some business with us even when there is a conflict of interest.                                         39    THE SMITHS EXERCISE  CONTROL OVER ALL MATTERS  SUBMITTED TO A STOCKHOLDER  VOTE, AND MAY HAVE INTERESTS THAT DIFFER FROM YOURS.       David D. Smith,  Frederick  G. Smith,  J. Duncan  Smith and Robert E. Smith control the  outcome of all matters  submitted  to a vote of  stockholders.  The Smiths hold class B common stock,  which  generally has 10 votes per share.  Our class A common stock has only one vote per share.  Our other series of preferred stock  generally  do not have  voting  rights.  We describe in detail the voting rights of shares of our capital stock in portions of Sinclair's  proxy statement for the  2000  annual  meeting  of  shareholders  under  the  heading  "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners", which we have incorporated by reference in this report. As of December 31, 1999, the Smiths held shares representing 90% of the vote on most matters and  representing 50% of the vote on the few matters for which  class B shares  have only one vote per share.  The Smiths have agreed with each other that until 2005 they will vote for each other as director.  CERTAIN  FEATURES OF OUR CAPITAL  STRUCTURE MAY DETER OTHERS FROM  ATTEMPTING TO ACQUIRE SINCLAIR.       The control the Smiths have over  stockholder  votes may  discourage  other companies  from trying to acquire us. In addition,  our board of  directors  can issue  additional  shares of  preferred  stock with  rights  that might  further discourage  other  companies from trying to acquire us. Anyone trying to acquire us would  likely  offer to pay more for shares of class A common  stock than the amount those shares were trading for in market  trades at the time of the offer. If the  voting  rights  of the  Smiths  or the  right to issue  preferred  stock discourage such takeover attempts, stockholders may be denied the opportunity to receive  such a premium.  The general  level of prices for class A common  stock might also be lower than it would be if these  deterrents  to takeovers  did not exist.  WE DEPEND ON ADVERTISING  REVENUE,  WHICH MAY DECREASE  DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS.       Our main  source of revenue is sales of  advertising  time.  Our ability to      sell advertising time depends on:            o    the health of the  economy in the areas  where our  stations  are                located and in the nation as a whole;            o    the popularity of our programming;            o    changes in the makeup of the  population  in the areas  where our                stations are located;            o    the activities of our competitors; and            o    other factors that may be beyond our control.       For  example,  a labor  dispute  or other  disruption  at a major  national advertiser,  or a recession in a particular market, would make it more difficult to sell advertising time and could reduce our revenue.  WE MUST PURCHASE  TELEVISION  PROGRAMMING  IN ADVANCE,  BUT CANNOT  PREDICT IF A PARTICULAR SHOW WILL BE POPULAR ENOUGH TO COVER ITS COST.       One  of  our  most  significant  costs  is  television  programming.  If  a particular program is not popular, we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover the costs of the program.  Since we purchase  programming  content from  others,  we also have little  control  over the costs of  programming.  We usually must  purchase  programming  several  years in advance,  and may have to commit to purchase more than one year's worth of  programming.  Finally,  we may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred,  or accounted fully for the costs on our books for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.  WE  MAY  LOSE  A  LARGE  AMOUNT  OF  PROGRAMMING  IF  A  NETWORK  TERMINATES ITS AFFILIATION  WITH  US.  WE  ALSO  CANNOT  BE  SURE  THE  NETWORKS  WILL  PROVIDE ATTRACTIVE PROGRAMMING.       All but one of our television  stations operate as affiliates of a network. The vast majority of our prime time programming in  network-affiliated  stations comes from their  networks.  Our Fox affiliates  acquired in connection with the Sullivan and Max Media  acquisitions in 1998 (as further discussed in note 11 to the                                         40    attached  financial  statements)  and  three of our ABC  affiliates  do not have affiliation agreements with their respective network. The networks may terminate the affiliation of stations that do have affiliation  agreements,  under certain circumstances,  with between 15 days and six months'  notice.  The  relationship between networks and station owners is currently undergoing  significant change, and the networks  may seek  reduced or no fees to owners and may seek  increased compensation  in the form of additional  advertising,  cash payments or in other forms.  Networks may seek and receive  terms that reduce our revenue or increase our costs. If a network  terminates or fails to renew our  affiliation,  we will lose access to the  programming  offered by that  network.  We will need to find alternative  sources  of  programming,  which  may be  less  attractive  or more expensive.  COMPETITION FROM OTHER  BROADCASTERS AND OTHER SOURCES MAY CAUSE OUR ADVERTISING SALES TO GO DOWN OR OUR COSTS TO GO UP.       We face intense competition in our industry and markets from the following:       New Technology and the Subdivision of Markets.  New technologies enable our competitors to tailor their  programming for specific  segments of the listening and viewing  public to a degree not possible  before.  As a result,  the overall market share of  broadcasters,  such as us whose equipment may not permit such a discriminating approach is under new pressures. The new technologies include:            o    cable,            o    satellite-to-home distribution,            o    pay-per-view, and            o    home video and entertainment systems.       Future Technology under  Development.  Cable providers and direct broadcast satellite  companies are developing  new techniques  that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing  equipment.  These so-called "video  compression techniques"  will  reduce  the cost of  creating  channels,  and may lead to the division of the television  industry into ever more  specialized  niche markets. Video  compression  is  available  to us as well,  but  competitors  who  target programming  to such sharply  defined  markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues. Lowering the cost of creating channels may also encourage  new  competitors  to  enter  our  markets  and  compete  with  us for advertising revenue.       In-Market  Competition.  We also face more  conventional  competition  from rivals that may be larger and have greater resources than us. These include:            o    other local free over-the-air radio and broadcast stations, and            o    other media, such as newspapers and periodicals.       Deregulation.  Recent changes in law have also increased  competition.  The Telecommunications  Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act) created  greater  flexibility and removed some limits on station ownership.  The prices for stations have risen as a result.  Telephone,  cable,  and some other companies are also free to provide video services in competition  with us. Other proposed  legislation  would relax existing  prohibitions  on the  simultaneous  ownership of  telephone  and cable businesses.  As a result of these  changes,  new companies are able to enter our markets and compete with us.  OUR RECENT INVESTMENTS IN INTERNET  BUSINESSES MAY NOT DELIVER THE VALUE WE PAID FOR THEM OR REACH OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.       Our strategy now  includes  investing in and working with  Internet-related businesses.  In pursuit of this  strategy,  we made three equity  investments in Internet related businesses in 1999 and intend to make additional investments as appropriate  opportunities  arise.  The  long  term  value of  Internet  related businesses  has yet to be  determined,  and we  cannot  assure  you  that  these investments will be worth the amount of our investment,  or that we will be able to develop  services that are profitable for Sinclair or the businesses in which we have  invested.  If the businesses in which we have invested fail to succeed, we may  lose as much as all of our  investment  in the  businesses.  We may also spend additional funds and devote additional resources to these businesses,  and these additional investments may also be lost.                                         41    THE PHASED  INTRODUCTION OF DIGITAL TELEVISION WILL INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED COMPETITION.       The FCC has mandated the phased  introduction  of digital  television  from 1999 to 2006,  starting with the  affiliates of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC in the top ten markets.  These stations were required to commence  broadcasting  in digital format by May 1, 1999.  The  affiliates of these networks in the next 20 markets were  required to commence  digital  broadcasting  by November  1999.  We had no stations that needed to have digital  operations by the May 1, 1999 deadline and 5 stations  that needed to meet the November  1999  deadline.  As of the date of this 10-K, none of our stations are broadcasting in digital format.  The FCC has granted DTV construction  permits and extensions to commence digital  operations until May 2000 with respect to two of these  stations.  We informed the FCC that these  stations,  like  many  other  stations,  were  unable  to  begin  digital operations by November 1999 due to delays in procuring and installing  necessary equipment.  We have  informed  the FCC that we expect to  construct  our digital facilities  for these  stations by the end of the second  quarter of 2000.  With respect  to the other  three  stations,  we have  applications  pending  for DTV construction  permits and the FCC has granted us special temporary authority for two of  these  stations  to  begin  digital  operations  prior  to  grant of the construction  permit.   During  the  transition  period,  each  existing  analog television  station  will be  permitted  to operate a second  station  that will broadcast using the digital standard. After completion of the transition period, the FCC will reclaim the non-digital channels.       There is considerable  uncertainty  about the final form of the FCC digital regulations.  Even so,  we  believe  that  these new  developments  may have the following effects on us:            Signal  Quality  Issues.  Our tests have  indicated  that the  digital           standard mandated by the FCC, 8-level vestigial  sideband (8-VSB),  is           currently  unable to provide for  reliable  reception  of a DTV signal           through a simple indoor antenna. Absent improvements in DTV receivers,           or an FCC ruling allowing us to use an alternative standard, continued           reliance on the 8-VSB digital standard may not allow us to provide the           same  reception  coverage with our digital  signals as we can with our           current analog signals.  Additionally,  because of this poor reception           quality and coverage,  we may be forced to rely on cable television or           other  alterative means of transmission to deliver our digital signals           to all of the  viewers  we are able to reach with our  current  analog           signals.            Reclamation  of Analog  Channels.  Congress  directed the FCC to begin           auctioning   analog   channels  60-69  this  year  and  the  remaining           non-digital channels by September 30, 2002, even though the FCC is not           to reclaim them until 2006. Congress further permitted broadcasters to           bid on the  non-digital  channels  in  cities  with  populations  over           400,000. If the channels are owned by our competitors,  they may exert           increased competitive pressure on our operations.            Capital and Operating Costs. We will incur costs to replace  equipment           in our stations in order to provide  digital  television.  Some of our           stations  will also  incur  increased  utilities  costs as a result of           converting to digital operations. We cannot be certain we will be able           to increase revenues to offset these additional costs.            Subscription Fees and System Compatibility.  The FCC has determined to           assess  a fee  in  the  amount  of 5% of  gross  revenues  on  digital           television  subscription  services. If we are unable to pass this cost           through to our subscribers, this fee will reduce our earnings from the           digital television subscription services we are planning. The FCC also           is  considering  whether to  require  cable  systems to carry  digital           television signals. Under current regulations,  cable systems are only           required to carry  non-digital  signals.  Given this climate of market           uncertainty and regulatory  change,  we cannot be sure what impact the           FCC's  actions  might  have on our  plans and  results  in the area of           digital television.  FEDERAL   REGULATION   OF   THE   BROADCASTING  INDUSTRY  LIMITS  OUR  OPERATING FLEXIBILITY.       The FCC regulates our business,  just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting  industry.  We must ask the FCC's  approval  whenever we need a new license, seek to renew or assign a license, purchase                                         42    a new station,  or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries  that holds a license.  Our FCC licenses and those of the stations we program pursuant to LMAs are critical to our  operations;  we cannot  operate  without them. We cannot be certain  that the FCC will renew these  licenses  in the future,  or approve new acquisitions.       Federal  legislation  and FCC rules have  changed  significantly  in recent years.  We anticipate  further  changes in the rules on digital  television.  We discuss some of the possible  effects of these  changes  elsewhere in this 10-K, but we  cannot  predict  all the  effects  that  such  changes  may  have on our business.  THE  FCC'S  OWNERSHIP   RESTRICTIONS  LIMIT  OUR  ABILITY  TO  OPERATE  MULTIPLE TELEVISION STATIONS, AND FUTURE CHANGES IN THESE RULES MAY THREATEN OUR EXISTING STRATEGIC APPROACH TO CERTAIN TELEVISION MARKETS.  General Limitations       The FCC's ownership rules limit us from having "attributable  interests" in television stations that reach more than 35% of all television households in the U.S. Under the FCC's method for calculating this limit, our television  stations will reach approximately 15% of U.S. television households after we complete our pending purchases and sales of stations.  Changes in the Rules on Television Ownership and Local Marketing Agreements       In 1999, the FCC revised its local television ownership and LMA attribution rules. In the past, a licensee could not own two television stations in a market but could own one station and program another station pursuant to an LMA because LMAs were not considered  attributable  interests.  The new television ownership rules allow us to own more than one television station in a market: (1) if there is no Grade B overlap  between  the  stations;  (2) if the  stations  are in two different Nielsen  Designated Market Areas; or (3) if the market containing both the stations  contains at least eight  separately  owned  full-power  television stations,  and not more than one is among the  top-four  rated  stations  in the market.  In  addition,  we may  request a waiver of the rule to acquire a second station in the market if the station to be acquired is  economically  distressed or unbuilt and there is no party who does not own a local television station who would  purchase the station for a  reasonable  price.  We  currently  program 26 television stations pursuant to LMAs. We have entered into agreements to acquire 16 of the stations  that we program  pursuant to an LMA.  Once we acquire  these stations, the LMAs will terminate.       Under the new ownership rules,  LMAs are now attributable  where a licensee owns a television  station and programs a television station in the same market. The new rules  provide that LMAs entered into on or after  November 5, 1996 have until  August 5,  2001 to come into  compliance  with the new  ownership  rules, otherwise such LMAs will  terminate.  LMAs entered into before  November 5, 1996 will be grandfathered until the conclusion of the FCC's 2004 biennial review. In certain  cases,  parties  with  grandfathered  LMAs,  may be able to rely on the circumstances at the time the LMA was entered into in advancing any proposal for co-ownership  of the  station.  Of the  remaining  10  stations  that we program pursuant  to an LMA and are not  acquiring,  5 LMAs  were  entered  into  before November 5, 1996,  and 5 LMAs were entered into on or after November 5, 1996. As a result of these  changes,  we may be forced to terminate or modify some of our remaining LMAs.       Terminating  or  modifying  our  LMAs  could  affect  our  business  in the following ways:            Losses on  Investments.  As part of our LMA  arrangements,  we own the           non-license  assets used by the stations  with which we have LMAs.  If           LMA arrangements are no longer  permitted,  we would be forced to sell           these assets,  or find another use for them.  If LMAs are  prohibited,           the  market for such  assets  may not be as good as when we  purchased           them and we would need to sell the assets to the owner or a  purchaser           of the related license assets. Therefore, we cannot be certain we will           recoup our investments.            Termination  Penalties.  If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate           existing LMAs before the terms of the LMAs expire, we may be forced to           pay termination penalties under the terms of some of our LMAs.                                         43         The FCC requires the  owner/licensee  of a station to maintain  independent control over the  programming  and operations of the station.  As a result,  the owners/licensees of the stations with which we have LMAs can exert their control in ways that may be counter  to our  interests,  including  the right to preempt programming or terminate in certain instances.       These  preemption and termination  rights cause us some uncertainty that we will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased, and therefore uncertainty   about  the   advertising   revenues  we  will  receive  from  such programming.       Failure of  Owner/Licensee  to Exercise  Control.  In addition,  if the FCC determines that the owner/licensee is not exercising  sufficient control, it may penalize the owner/licensee by a fine, revocation of the license for the station or a denial of the renewal of the license.       Any one of these scenarios might affect our financial  results,  especially the  revocation  of or denial of renewal of a license.  In  addition,  penalties might also affect our qualifications to hold FCC licenses,  and thus place those licenses at risk.  WE HAVE LOST MONEY IN THREE OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY.       We have  suffered net losses in three of the last five years.  In 1999,  we reported  earnings,  but this was largely due to a gain on the sale of our radio stations and recognition of an unrealized gain on a derivative  instrument.  Our losses are due to the following significant cash and non-cash expenses:            o    Cash Expenses:       Interest            o    Non-cash  Expenses:  Depreciation,   amortization  (primarily  of                                     programming and  intangibles),  and deferred                                     compensation.       We expect our net losses to continue indefinitely for the same reasons.                                              44    ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. To manage our exposure to changes in interest  rates,  we enter into interest rate  derivative hedging agreements.  We have entered into an additional derivative instrument to monetize  the  benefit  of  a  call  option  on a  portion  of  our  outstanding indebtedness  at  interest  rates  prevailing  at the time we  entered  into the instrument.   This  derivative   instrument  (the  treasury  option   derivative instrument) exposes us to market risk from a further decrease in interest rates, but we  believe  that  this risk is offset  by the  benefit  to us from  reduced interest  rate expense on a portion of our floating rate debt and the ability to call some of our  indebtedness  and replace it with debt at the lower prevailing interest rates.       Finally,  we  have  entered  put and  call  option  derivative  instruments relating  to our class A common  stock in order to hedge  against  the  possible dilutive  effects of employees  exercising  stock options  pursuant to our stock option plans.       We do  not  enter  into  derivative  instruments  for  speculative  trading purposes.  With the  exception  of our  treasury  option  derivative  instrument (described below), we do not reflect the changes in fair market value related to derivative instruments in the accompanying financial statements.  INTEREST RATE RISKS       We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates,  which arises from the floating rate debt. As of December 31, 1999, we were  obligated on $1.0 billion  of  indebtedness  carrying  a  floating  interest  rate.  We enter into interest rate  derivative  agreements to reduce the impact of changing  interest rates on our floating rate debt. The 1998 bank credit agreement,  as amended and restated, requires us to enter into interest rate protection agreements at rates not to exceed 10% per annum as to a notional  principal amount at least equal to 60% of the term loan,  revolving credit facility and senior  subordinated  notes scheduled to be outstanding from time to time.       As of December 31, 1999, we had several interest rate swap agreements which expire from July 23, 2000 to July 15, 2007. The swap agreements  effectively set fixed  rates on our  floating  rate debt in the range of 5.5% to 8.1%.  Floating interest  rates are based upon the three month  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate (LIBOR), and the measurement and settlement is performed quarterly.       Settlements  of these  agreements  are recorded as  adjustments to interest expense  in  the  relevant  periods.  The  notional  amounts  related  to  these agreements  were $1.0 billion at December 31, 1999, and decrease to $200 million through the  expiration  dates.  In  addition,  we entered  into  floating  rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling $750 million.  Based on our currently hedged position, $1.8 billion or 96% of our outstanding indebtedness is hedged.       Based on our debt levels and the amount of floating rate debt not hedged as of March 15,  2000,  a 1% increase in the LIBOR rate would result in an increase in annualized interest expense of approximately $14.0 million.  TREASURY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT       In August 1998, we entered into a treasury option derivative contract.  The option derivative  contract provides for 1) an option exercise date of September 30,  2000,  2) a notional  amount of $300  million and 3) a  five-year  treasury strike  rate  of  6.14%.  If the  interest  rate  yield  on five  year  treasury securities is less than the strike rate on the option exercise date, we would be obligated  to pay five  consecutive  annual  payments in an amount  equal to the strike rate less the five year treasury rate  multiplied by the notional  amount beginning  September  30, 2001 through  September 30, 2006. If the interest rate yield on five year  treasuries  at September 30, 2000 were to equal the two year forward five year treasury rate on December 31, 1999 for  treasuries  settled on September 30, 2000, we would not be required to make payments.       Upon the execution of the option  derivative  contract,  we received a cash payment  representing  an option  premium of $9.5 million  which was recorded in "Other long-term  liabilities" in the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets. We are required to periodically adjust our liability to the present value of                                         45    the future  payments of the  settlement  amounts  based on the forward five year treasury  rate  at the  end of an  accounting  period.  The  fair  market  value adjustment for 1999 resulted in an income statement benefit (unrealized gain) of $15.7  million for the year ended  December 31, 1999.  If the yield on five year treasuries  at  September  30, 2000 were to equal the two year forward five year treasury  rate on  December  31, 1999  (6.4%),  we would not be required to make payments.       We have the ability to call our 10% senior  subordinated  notes due 2005 on September 15, 2000. The value of this call is determined by new issuance  yields for senior  subordinated  debt at that  time.  The value of this call rises when yields  fall and falls when  yields  rise.  New  issuance  yields are based on a spread over treasury yields. If the yield on five-year  treasuries remains below 6.14% until  September  30,  2000,  we expect to be able to call those notes and refinance  at the lower  prevailing  rates,  thus  offsetting  the effect of the payments  required  under  the  treasury  option  derivative.  There  can  be no assurance,  however,  that we would be able to refinance  the 1995 Notes at such time at favorable interest rates.       We are also  exposed to risk from a change in interest  rates to the extent we are required to refinance  existing fixed rate  indebtedness  at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing  indebtedness was incurred. As of December 31, 1999, we have senior  subordinated  notes totaling $300 million and $450 million expiring in the years 2005 and 2007,  respectively.  Based upon the quoted  market  price,  the fair  value of the notes was  $713.6  million  as of December 31, 1999.  Generally,  the fair market value of the notes will decrease as interest  rates rise and increase as interest  rates fall. We estimate that a 1% increase from  prevailing  interest  rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the notes by approximately $33.6 million as of December 31, 1999.  EQUITY PUT OPTION DERIVATIVES       We are exposed to market risk relating to our equity put option  derivative instruments  . The  contract  terms  relating to these  instruments  provide for settlement  on the  expiration  date.  The  equity  puts  require  us to  make a settlement  payment to the  counterparties to these contracts (payable in either cash or shares of our class A common  stock) in an amount that is  approximately equal to the put strike  price minus the price of our class A common stock as of the  termination  date.  If the put  strike  price is less than the price of our class A common stock as of the  termination  date,  we would not be obligated to make a settlement payment. In addition, certain of these contracts include terms allowing  the put  option to  become  immediately  exercisable  upon our class A common stock trading at certain  levels.
