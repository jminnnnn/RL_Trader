ITEM 7.                                      MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     The following Managements Discussion and Analysis provides qualitative and quantitative information about our financial performance and condition and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those statements.  This discussion consists of the following sections:     Executive Overview   a description of our business, financial highlights from 2012, information about industry trends and sources of revenues and operating costs;     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   a discussion of the accounting policies that are most important in understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the consolidated financial statements and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements;     Results of Operations   a summary of the components of our revenues by category and by network affiliation or program service arrangement, a summary of other operating data and an analysis of our revenues and expenses for 2012, 2011 and 2010, including comparisons between years and certain expectations for 2013; and     Liquidity and Capital Resources   a discussion of our primary sources of liquidity, an analysis of our cash flows from or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, a discussion of our dividend policy and a summary of our contractual cash obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements.     We have two reportable operating segments, broadcast and other operating divisions that are disclosed separately from our corporate activities.  Our broadcast segment includes our stations.  Our other operating divisions segment primarily earned revenues in 2012 from sign design and fabrication; regional security alarm operating and bulk acquisitions; and real estate ventures.     STG, included in the broadcast segment and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (SBG), is the primary obligor under our Bank Credit Agreement, the 9.25% Notes, the 8.375% Notes and the 6.125% Notes.  SBG is a guarantor under the Bank Credit Agreement, the 9.25% Notes, the 8.375% Notes and the 6.125% Notes.  Our Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, the 4.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the 4.875% Notes) and the 3.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the 3.0% Notes) remain obligations or securities of SBG and not obligations or securities of STG.  SBG was the obligor of the 6.0% Notes until they were fully redeemed in 2011.     EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW     2012 Events     Acquisitions / Divestments:     ·                    In January, we closed the acquisition of the assets of Four Points Media Group LLC (Four Points) for $200.0 million, and financed the acquisition with a $180.0 million draw under a recently raised incremental Term Loan B commitment under our amended Bank Credit Agreement plus a $20.0 million cash escrow previously paid;  ·                    In April 2012, we closed the acquisition of the broadcast assets of Freedom Communications (Freedom) for $385.0      40          million, and financed the acquisition with an incremental draw of $157.5 on Term loan A and an incremental draw of $192.5 million on Term loan B under our Bank Credit Agreement plus a $38.5 million escrow release previously paid in November 2011;  ·                    In October, we entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all the assets of the WUTB-TV (MNT) station in Baltimore, MD owned by Fox Television Stations, Inc. (FTS) for $2.7 million, subject to FCC approval and other closing conditions.  Our agreement to purchase the license assets was assigned to Deerfield for $0.3 million, bringing our net purchase price to $2.4 million. Upon closing, we intend to provide sales and other non-programming services to this station pursuant to outsourcing arrangements;  ·                    Effective December 1, 2012, we closed the asset acquisition of Bay TV, which owns WTTA-TV (MNT) in the Tampa / St. Petersburg, Florida market, for $40.0 million.  We have performed sales, programming and other management services for this station pursuant to a LMA since January 1999.  The LMA was terminated upon closing;  ·                    Effective December 1, 2012, we closed the asset acquisition of certain broadcast assets of Newport, for $460.5 million (excludes amounts paid by Deerfield for the license assets of certain stations) as well as acquired Newports rights under the local marketing agreements with WLYH-TV (CW) in Harrisburg, PA and KMTW-TV (MNT) in Wichita, KS, along with options to acquire the license assets of these stations.  We financed the acquisition with the proceeds from our offering of 6.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due October 2022, which closed in October 2012 as described below, plus a $41.3 million cash escrow previously paid;  ·                    Effective December 1, 2012, we closed on our agreement to purchase the assets of KBTV-TV (FOX) located in Beaumont, TX for $12.5 million (excluding amounts paid by Deerfield for the license assets);  ·                    Effective December 1, 2012, we closed on our agreements with Deerfield to sell Deerfield the license assets of one of our stations in San Antonio (KMYS-TV CW) and our station in Cincinnati (WSTR-TV MNT) for a total of $10.7 million, and assigned to Deerfield the right to buy the license assets of WPMI-TV and WJTC-TV in the Mobile / Pensacola market, WHAM-TV in the Rochester, NY market and KBTV-TV in the Beaumont, TX market for $13.5 million.  We also acquired the options to acquire the license assets of these stations held by Deerfield.  We provide sales and other non-programming services to each of these five stations pursuant to outsourcing agreements;  ·                    On December 31, 2012 we closed on the purchase of the non-license assets of GoCom Media, Incs (GoCom) three television stations, WRSP-TV (FOX), WCCU-TV (FOX), WBUI-TV (CW), in the Champaign / Springfield / Decatur, Illinois market for $25.7 million, along with options for the license assets.  We provide sales and other non-programming services to these stations pursuant outsourcing agreements.     Other:     ·                    In February, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share which was paid on March 15, 2012, to the holders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2012;  ·                    In May, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share which was paid on June 15, 2012, to the holders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2012;  ·                    On May 14, 2012, the Company and the licensees of stations to which we provide services, representing 20 affiliates of Fox Broadcast Company (FOX) in total, extended the network affiliation agreements with FOX from the existing term of December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2017.  Concurrently, we entered into an assignable option agreement with FTS giving us or our assignee the right to purchase substantially all the assets of the WUTB-TV station (Baltimore, MD) owned by FTS, which has a program service arrangement with MyNetwork, and entered into an option agreement giving FTS the right to purchase our stations in up to three of the following four markets: Las Vegas, NV, Raleigh, NC, Cincinnati, OH, and Norfolk, VA. The option was due to expire March 30, 2013; however, in January 2013, FTS notified the Company that it would not exercise its option to purchase our stations in any of the aforementioned markets.  In the second quarter of 2012, we paid $25.0 million to FOX pursuant to the agreement and we are required to pay the last installment payment in the amount of $25.0 million, due on April 26, 2013;  ·                    In August, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share which was paid on September 14, 2012, to the holders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2012;  ·                    In August, we entered into a multi-year retransmission consent agreement with DISH Network for continued carriage in all of our markets;  ·                    In September, we entered into an amendment of our Bank Credit Agreement to provide more flexibility with restrictive covenants and permitted incremental indebtedness. There were no changes pertaining to interest rates or maturities of the outstanding debt or commitments under the Bank Credit Agreement;  ·                    In October, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 (the Notes). The Notes were priced at 100% of their principal amount and bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, commencing on April 1, 2013. The Notes mature in October 2022 and are guaranteed by Sinclair and certain of its subsidiaries. See  Liquidity and Capital Resources  for more information;  ·                    In November, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share and a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share payable on December 14, 2012, to the holders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2012; and     41          ·                    In November, we entered into a multi-year retransmission consent agreement with Mediacom for continued carriage of our stations which are located in Mediacoms markets.     2013 Events     ·                    Effective January 1, 2013, we entered into a six-year affiliation agreement with the CBS Network on its Portland, ME and Cedar Rapids, IA affiliates, expiring December 31, 2018;  ·                    In January 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets of WLWC-TV (CW) in Providence, Rhode Island to OTA Broadcasting LLC for $13.8 million.  The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013, subject to FCC approval and other closing conditions. As of December, 31, 2012 the station is classified as held for sale and the results of operations are classified as discontinued operations;  ·                    In February 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share which is payable on March 15, 2013, to the holders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2013;  ·                    In February 2013, we entered into an agreement to purchase certain stock and/or broadcast assets of four television stations, located in four markets, owned by COX Media Group for $99.0 million less $4.3 million of working capital adjustments, less amounts to be paid by third party companies, and entered into an agreement to provide sales services to one other station. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013 subject to the approval of the FCC and customary antitrust clearance;  ·                    In February 2013, we entered into an agreement to purchase the broadcast assets of 18 television stations owned by Barrington Broadcasting Group, LLC for $370.0 million, less amounts to be paid by third parties, and entered into agreements to operate or provide sales services to another six stations. Also, the Company will sell its station WSYT-TV (FOX) and assign its LMA with WNYS-TV (MNT) in Syracuse, NY, and sell its station in Peoria IL, WYZZ-TV (FOX). The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013 subject to the approval of the FCC and customary antitrust clearance;  ·                    In February, we entered into a retransmission consent agreement with DirecTV for continued carriage in all of our markets; and  ·                    Effective March 1, 2013, we closed the sale of the assets of WLAJ-TV (ABC) in Lansing, MI to an unrelated third party for $14.4 million.  The related results from operations, net of related income taxes, have been reclassified from income from continuing operations and reflected as net income from discontinued operations.     Industry Trends     ·                    Political advertising increases in even-numbered years, such as 2012, due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections and issue-related advertiser spending.  In addition, political revenue has consistently risen between presidential election or mid-term election years such as from 2008 to 2012 or from 2006 to 2010, respectively.  In every fourth year, such as 2012, political advertising is usually elevated further due to presidential elections;  ·                    The FCC has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi-channel broadcasts.  The FCC must-carry rules only apply to a stations primary digital stream;  ·                    Retransmission consent rules provide a mechanism for broadcasters to seek payment from MVPDs who carry broadcasters signals.  Recognition of the value of the programming content provided by broadcasters, including local news and other programming and network programming all in HD has generated increased local revenues;  ·                    We, as well as a number of other broadcasters, have joined and worked together in organizations such as the NAB (along with OMVC now merged), M500 and the MCV to focus on efforts to accelerate the nationwide availability of mobile DTV and other advanced digital distribution services and work through the many programming, advertising, distribution and aggregation opportunities.  There is potential for broadcasters to create an additional revenue stream by providing their signals to a wide variety of mobile / portable devices (tablets, laptops, smartphones, etc.) as well as through other multi-channel / multi-platform initiatives;  ·                    Automotive-related advertising is a significant portion of our total net revenues in all periods presented and these revenues trended downward in most of 2009 due to the economic turmoil.  However, this sector has dramatically trended upward in the past few years due to improved economic conditions;  ·                    Many broadcasters are enhancing / upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content, such as newscasts and weather updates, to attract advertisers and to compete with other internet sites and smart phone and tablet device applications;  ·                    Seasonal advertising increases occur in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers;  ·                    Broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain      42          locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements;  ·                    Station outsourcing arrangements are becoming more common as broadcasters seek out ways to improve revenues and margins;  ·                    Advertising revenue related to the Olympics occurs in even numbered years and the Super Bowl is aired on a different network each year.  Both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues; and  ·                    Compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has halted.  Networks now require compensation from broadcasters for the use of network programming.     Sources of Revenues and Costs     Our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and, to a much lesser extent, from political advertisers.  We also generate local revenues from our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs.  Our revenues from local advertisers have seen a continued upward trend, with the exception of 2008 and 2009 when non-political revenues fell due to the economic recession.  Revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of total broadcast revenues.  We believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues, combined with a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services.  Our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasingly competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non-traditional services to our advertisers including the success of multi-channel digital initiatives together with mobile DTV.  In addition, our revenue success is dependent on the success and advertising spending levels of the automotive industry.     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES     This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts, program contract costs, intangible assets, income taxes, property and equipment, and investments.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  These estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results.  However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.     We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations.  For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see  Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.     Valuation of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Equity and Cost Method Investments .     We periodically evaluate our goodwill, broadcast licenses, long-lived assets, intangible assets and equity and cost method investments for potential impairment indicators.  Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows, market conditions, operating performance of our stations, legal factors and other various qualitative factors.     We have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets, which requires such assets along with our goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often when certain triggering events occur.  As of December 31, 2012, we had $1,074.0 million of goodwill, $85.1 million in broadcast licenses, and $623.4 million in definite-lived intangibles.  We perform our annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses at the beginning of the fourth quarter each year.     In 2011, we early adopted the accounting guidance related to the annual goodwill impairment assessment, which allowed us, to first qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that goodwill has been impaired.  As part of our qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment, we consider the following factors related to the reporting units, where applicable:     ·         Significant changes in the macroeconomic conditions;  ·         Significant changes in the regulatory environment;     43          ·                    Significant changes in the operating model, management, products and services, customer base, cost structure and/or margin trends;  ·                    Comparison of current and prior year operating performance and forecast trends for future operating performance; and  ·                    The excess of the fair value over carrying value of the reporting units determined in prior quantitative assessments.     If we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired, we will apply the quantitative two-step method for goodwill.  Prior to 2011, the annual impairment test for goodwill was performed using the quantitative two-step method, for all reporting units.  Our quantitative assessment for our goodwill consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting units, using a combination of a market approach, using recent comparable market transactions and estimated market multiples, and an income approach, using a discounted cash flow model.  The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment consist of discount rates, revenue and expense growth rates and comparable business multiples.  The projected growth rates are based on our internal forecast of future performance, historical trends, and projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections.  The discount rate is based on a number of factors including market interest rates, a weighted average cost of capital analysis based on the target capital structure for a television station, and includes adjustments for market risk and company specific risk.  For goodwill, if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we then perform the second step which requires allocation of the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill to determine the implied fair value.  An impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount.     We early adopted the recent accounting guidance related to the annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, which allowed us, beginning with our 2012 indefinite-lived intangible impairment test, to first qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset has been impaired.  As part of our qualitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we consider the following factors related to the indefinite-lived intangible asset, where applicable:     ·                    Significant changes in cost factors that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset;  ·                    Significant changes in the legal or regulatory environment;  ·                    Significant changes in management, key personnel, strategy or customers that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset;  ·                    Significant changes in the industry and/or market;  ·                    Significant changes in macroeconomic conditions;  ·                    Comparison of current and prior year operating performance and forecast trends for future operating performance; and  ·                    The excess of the fair value over carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets determined in prior quantitative assessments.     If we conclude that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we will calculate the fair market value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and compare to the book value.  Prior to 2012, the annual impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangibles, broadcast licenses, involved a quantitative assessment in which we estimated the fair market value of our broadcast licenses and compared to the book value.  We estimated the fair market value of our broadcast licenses using a discounted cash flow model.  The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses consist of discount rates, normalized market share, normalized profit margin, expected future growth rates and estimated start-up costs.  We then compared the estimated fair market value to the book value of these assets to determine if impairment exists.  For the broadcast licenses, if the fair value is less than book value, we would record the resulting impairment.     We aggregate our stations by market for purposes of our goodwill and license impairment testing and we believe that our markets are most representative of our broadcast reporting units because segment management views, manages and evaluates our stations on a market basis.  Furthermore, in our markets where we operate or provide services to more than one station, certain costs of operating the stations are shared including the use of buildings and equipment, the sales force and administrative personnel.  Our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within each designated marketing area, as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms-length transaction.     Based on the results of our annual qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment performed in 2012, we concluded that we would need to perform a quantitative Step 1 test for three of our markets which had aggregate goodwill of $79.5 million as of October 1, 2012, the date of our annual impairment test.  These markets had a decrease in operating results for the past few years and therefore, we estimated the fair value of these reporting units based on a market approach and income approach.  For all three markets, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value by more than 10%.  For all our other reporting      44          units, we concluded based on the qualitative assessment that it was more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units would sufficiently exceed their carrying values and it was not necessary to perform the quantitative two-step method.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase in our discount rate and/or a decrease in our multiple of 10% would not result in goodwill impairment.  Based on the annual qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment performed in 2011, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of all reporting units would sufficiently exceed their carrying value and thus it was not necessary to perform the quantitative two-step method.  The qualitative factors for our reporting units reviewed during our 2012 and 2011 assessments, with the exception of the three markets in which we performed a quantitative assessment, indicated stable or improving margins and favorable or stable forecasted economic conditions including stable discount rates and comparable business multiples. Additionally, the results of prior quantitative assessments supported significant excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units.  As a result of our 2010 annual quantitative impairment assessment, all of our reporting units had fair values in excess of carrying value and therefore, we did not record any goodwill impairment during the year ended December 31, 2010.     Based on the annual qualitative assessment for broadcast license impairment performed in 2012, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of all broadcast licenses would sufficiently exceed their carrying values and thus it was not necessary to perform a quantitative test.  The qualitative factors for our broadcast licenses indicated an increase in market revenues, consistent expected market growth rates, stable market shares and stable cost factors from 2011 to 2012.  We recorded a $0.4 million interim impairment charge in the first quarter of 2011 due to an anticipated increase in construction costs for one of our stations as a result of converting to full power.  As a result of our annual impairment test for broadcast licenses in 2011, we concluded that impairment did not exist.  The revenue, expense and constant growth rates used in determining the fair value of our broadcast licenses increased slightly from 2010 to 2011.  The discount rates used to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses did not change significantly from 2010 to 2011.  During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded $4.8 million in impairment on our broadcast licenses and other assets.  The $4.8 million impairment charge recorded in 2010 was primarily the result of additional cash outflows for increased signal strength necessary to maintain competitive market positions.     We believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to evaluate whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units and broadcast licenses was less than their carrying values.  If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, including future events such as a deterioration of market conditions or significant increases in discount rates, we could be exposed to impairment charges in the future.  Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows.     For all other long-lived assets, including fixed assets and definite-lived intangibles, we assess recoverability of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the assets may not be recoverable.  If we conclude that such triggering event has occurred, we perform a two-step quantitative test to first assess whether the asset is recoverable by comparing the sum of undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group, including goodwill.  If the sum of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, we then measure and allocate the amount of impairment to record for each of the assets in the asset group by comparing the respective fair value of the assets to their carrying values.  We did not have any indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets in 2010, 2011 or 2012.     When factors indicate that there may be a decrease in value of an equity or cost method investment, we assess that investment and determine whether a loss in value has occurred.  If that loss is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recorded.  For any investments that indicate a potential impairment, we estimate the fair value of those investments using discounted cash flow models, unrelated third party valuations or industry comparables, based on the various facts available to us.  During 2012 and 2010, we recorded $1.3 million and $6.7 million of impairment on equity method investments, respectively.  No impairment of our equity or cost method investments was recorded 2011.     Revenue Recognition .  Advertising revenues, net of agency commissions, are recognized in the period during which commercials are aired.  All other revenues are recognized as services are provided.  The revenues realized from station barter arrangements are recorded as the programs are aired at the estimated fair value of the advertising airtime given in exchange for the program rights.  Some of our retransmission consent agreements contain both advertising and retransmission consent elements that are paid in cash.  We have determined that these agreements are revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.  Advertising and retransmission consent deliverables sold under our agreements are separated into different units of accounting based on fair value.  Revenue applicable to the advertising element of the arrangement is recognized consistent with the advertising revenue policy noted above.  Revenue applicable to the retransmission consent element of the arrangement is recognized over the life of the agreement.     Allowance for Doubtful Accounts .  We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments.  If the economy and/or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.  For example, a 10% increase in the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2012, would increase bad     45          debt expense by approximately $0.3 million.  The allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.1 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.     Program Contract Costs .  We have agreements with distributors for the rights to televise programming over contract periods, which generally run from one to seven years.  Contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period.  Each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing.  The portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we recorded $69.3 million and $54.5 million, respectively, in program contract assets and $104.4 million and $91.5 million, respectively, in program contract liabilities.     The programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value (NRV).  Estimated NRVs are based on managements expectation of future advertising revenue, net of sales commissions, to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms.  Amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using a four-year accelerated method or a straight-line method, depending on the length of the contract.  Program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets.  Program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not impacted by adjustments for amortization or estimated NRV.  If our estimate of future advertising revenues declines, then additional write downs to NRV may be required.     Income Tax.   We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.  As of December 31 2011, we recorded $4.9 million in deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we recorded $234.1 million and $247.6 million, respectively, in deferred tax liabilities.  We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  In evaluating our ability to realize net deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including our past operating results, tax planning strategies and forecasts of future taxable income.  In considering these sources of taxable income, we must make certain judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage our underlying businesses on a long-term basis.  A valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets related to a substantial portion of our available state net operating loss carryforwards, based on past operating results, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary book/tax basis differences, alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements     In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance for fair value measurements.  The purpose of the new guidance is to have a consistent definition of fair value between U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  Many of the amendments to GAAP are not expected to have a significant impact on practice; however, the new guidance does require new and enhanced disclosure about fair value measurements.  The amendments were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied prospectively. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements but we have included the additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures required for our Level 3 fair value measurements beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2012.     In September 2011, the FASB issued the final Accounting Standards Update for goodwill impairment testing.  The standard allows an entity to first consider qualitative factors when deciding whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step goodwill impairment test.  An entity would need to perform step-one if it determines qualitatively that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  The changes are effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.  We adopted this new guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011 in completing our annual impairment analysis.  See  Note 5. Goodwill, Broadcast Licenses and Other Intangible Assets  for further discussion of the results of our goodwill impairment analysis.  This guidance impacts how we perform the annual goodwill impairment test; however, it did not impact our consolidated financial statements as the guidance does not impact the timing or amount of any resulting impairment charges.     In July 2012, the FASB issued new guidance for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.  The new guidance allows companies to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary, similar to the approach now applied to goodwill.  Companies can first determine based on certain qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  The new standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.  The revised standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 2012 and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this new guidance in the fourth quarter of 2012 when completing our annual impairment analysis.   See Note 5. Goodwill, Broadcast Licenses and Other Intangible Assets  for further discussion of the results of our broadcast license impairment analysis.  This guidance impacted how we perform our annual impairment testing for      46          indefinite-lived intangible assets and changed our related disclosures for 2012; however, it does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as the guidance does not impact the timing or amount of any resulting impairment charges.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     In general, this discussion is related to the results of our continuing operations, except for discussions regarding our cash flows, which also include the results of our discontinued operations.  The results of the acquired stations from Four Points as of January 1, 2012 (acquisition date), from Freedom as of April 1, 2012 (acquisition date) and Newport as of December 1, 2012 (acquisition date) are included in our results of our continuing operations. In 2012, we determined that the operating results of WLAJ-TV, which was one of the stations acquired in the Freedom acquisition, and WLWC-TV, which was one of the stations acquired in the Four Points acquisition, should be accounted for as discontinued operations and therefore the results are not included in our consolidated results of continuing operations year ended December 31, 2012. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this discussion and analysis to 2012, 2011 and 2010 are to our fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Additionally, any references to the first, second, third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, respectively, for the year being discussed.  We have two reportable segments, broadcast and other operating divisions that are disclosed separately from our corporate activities.     Seasonality / Cyclicality     Our operating results are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations.  Usually, the second and fourth quarter operating results are higher than the first and third quarters because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.     Our operating results are usually subject to fluctuations from political advertising.  In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections.  Additionally, every four years, political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election.     Operating Data     The following table sets forth certain of our operating data from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in millions).  For definitions of terms, see the footnotes to the table in  Item 6.

for more information.     Our largest categories of advertising and their approximate percentages of 2012 net time sales, which include the advertising portion of our local and national broadcast revenues, were automotive (20.8%), political (14.0%), services (13.9%), schools (5.9%) and retail / department stores (5.0%).  No other advertising category accounted for more than 5.0% of our net time sales in 2012.  No advertiser accounted for more than 1.2% of our consolidated revenue in 2012.  We conduct business with thousands of advertisers.     Our primary types of programming and their approximate percentages of 2012 net time sales were syndicated programming (36.7%), network programming (24.2%), local news (25.1%), sports programming (8.1%) and direct advertising programming (5.9%).     From a network affiliation or program service arrangement perspective, the following table sets forth our affiliate percentages of net time sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and

into outsourcing agreements to provide certain non-programming related sales, operational and administrative services to 27 stations with the following network affiliation or program service arrangements: CBS (two stations in the first quarter, five stations in the second quarter and two stations in the fourth quarter), NBC (two stations in the fourth quarter), FOX (four stations in the fourth quarter), ABC (one station in the second quarter and one station in the fourth quarter), CW (two stations in the first quarter, one station in the second quarter and two stations in the fourth quarter), MyNetworkTV (two stations in the first quarter and one station in the fourth quarter), Other (one station in the first quarter and one station in the fourth quarter). We reclassified the results of operations of WLAJ-TV, an ABC station acquired in the second quarter and WLWC-TV a CW station acquired in the first quarter, as discontinued operations as discussed in  Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and therefore the net time sales of WLAJ-TV and WLWC-TV are not included in the percentages above and are excluded from the number of stations.     48          (b)           We broadcast programming from  network affiliations or program service arrangements with CBS (rebroadcasted content from other primary channels within the same markets), The CW, MyNetworkTV, This TV, ME TV, LATV, Weather Radar, The Weather Authority Network, Live Well Network, Antenna TV, Bounce Network, The Country Network, Azteca, Telemundo and Estrella on additional channels through our stations second and third digital signals.     (c)            The amount of increases in net time sales related to 2012 acquisitions was: FOX 0.4%, ABC 10.4%, CBS 752.6%, MyNetworkTV 3.2%, CW 19.3%, NBC 124.0% and Digital 159.8%.     Net Broadcast Revenues .   Net broadcast revenues increased $272.6 million for 2012 when comparing to 2011, of which $164.2 million was related to stations acquired during 2012. Additionally, revenues earned pursuant to the LMA with the Freedom stations during the first quarter of 2012 included $2.2 million for management services performed and $7.8 million of pass-through costs.  The remaining increase was due to increases in advertising revenues generated from the political, direct response and beer / wine sectors. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the internet, soft drinks, movies and drugs / cosmetic sectors. Excluding the stations acquired in 2012, automotive, which typically is our largest category, represented 20.3% of net time sales for the year ended December 31, 2012.     From a revenue category standpoint, 2011 when compared to 2010 was impacted by increases in most of the advertising sectors as the countrys economic conditions in general continued to strengthen.  Automotive, our largest category in 2011, was up 9.7% compared to 2010 as automotive dealers and manufacturers increased spending in response to an increase in auto sales.     Political Revenues . Political revenues, which include time sales from political advertising, increased by $88.6 million to $96.9 million for 2012 when compared to 2011. Political revenues decreased by $33.7 million to $8.3 million for 2011 when compared to 2010.   Political revenues are typically higher in election years such as 2012 and 2010.  Accordingly, we expect political revenues to decrease in 2013 from 2012 levels.     Local Revenues .  Excluding political revenues, our local broadcast revenues, which include local times sales, retransmission revenues and other local revenues, were up $144.8 million for 2012 when compared to 2011, of which $112.1 million related to the stations acquired in 2012. The remaining increase is due to an increase in advertising spending particularly in the automotive and direct response sectors and an increase in retransmission revenues from MVPDs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease due to a decline in advertising revenues from the schools, fast food and services sectors and a change in networks for the Super Bowl programming from FOX to NBC as we had 20 FOX stations compared to one NBC station at the time when the Super Bowl aired in February 2012. Excluding political revenues, our local broadcast revenues, which include local times sales, retransmission revenues and other local revenues, were up $34.7 million for 2011, compared to 2010.  The increase is due to an increase in advertising spending particularly in the automotive sector, an increase in retransmission revenues from MVPDs and amounts earned for services performed pursuant to the Four Points and Freedom LMAs ($2.2 million for management services performed and $7.8 million of pass-through costs).     National Revenues.   O ur national broadcast revenues, excluding political revenues, which include national time sales and other national revenues, were up $39.2 million for 2012 when compared to 2011, of which $38.5 million related to the stations acquired in 2012.  The remaining increase was due to increases in advertising revenues generated from the direct response and services sectors.  These increases were partially offset by a decline in advertising revenues in telecommunications and the drugs / cosmetic sectors.  Excluding political revenues, our national broadcast revenues were down $8.8 million for 2011 when compared to 2010.  This was primarily due to a decrease in advertising spending by the media, telecommunications, home products, professional services and movies sectors.     49          Broadcast Expenses     The following table presents our significant operating expense categories for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in millions):                                                        Percent Change    (Increase / (Decrease))                          2012           2011           2010           12 vs. 11           11 vs. 10              Station production   expenses           $     255.5           $     178.6           $     154.1           43.1     %     15.9     %        Station selling,   general and administrative expenses           $     171.3           $     123.9           $     127.1           38.3     %     (2.5     )%        Amortization of   program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments           $     61.0           $     52.1           $     60.9           17.1     %     (14.4     )%        Corporate general   and administrative expenses           $     28.9           $     24.8           $     23.7           16.5     %     4.6     %        Impairment of   goodwill, intangible and other assets           $                $     0.4           $     4.8           (100.0     )%     (91.7     )%        Depreciation and   amortization expenses           $     77.5           $     44.6           $     49.2           73.8     %     (9.3     )%           Station production expenses.   Station production expenses increased $76.9 million during 2012 compared to 2011, of which $42.7 million related to the stations acquired in 2012. The remaining increases for the year were primarily due to  an  increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements, increased compensation expense, increased employee / management incentive bonuses, increased news profit sharing expenses and increased rating service fees due to annual scheduled rate increases.     Station production expenses increased $24.5 million during 2011 compared to 2010. This increase was primarily due to an increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements, increased compensation expense (including amounts related to the Four Points and Freedom stations pursuant to the LMAs prior to acquisition, which were pass-through costs), increased promotional advertising expenses and increased rating service fees due to annual scheduled rate increases.  Additionally, news profit share expenses increased due to better news performance which resulted in higher payments to our news share partners.     Station selling, general and administrative expenses.   Station selling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.4 million during 2012 compared to 2011, of which $38.4 million related to the stations acquired in 2012. The remaining  increases for the year were primarily due to employee / management incentive bonuses, an increase in national sales commissions and increased compensation expense.     Station selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $3.2 million during 2011 compared to 2010.  This decrease was primarily due to lower non-income based tax expense, a decrease in stock-based compensation and decreased national sales agency and local commission costs.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses related to rollout of expanded digital product offerings.     We expect 2013 station production and station selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding barter and full year effect on 2012 acquisitions, to trend higher than our 2012 results.     Amortization of program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments.    The amortization of program contract costs increased $8.9 million during 2012 compared to 2011, of which $7.1 million related to the stations acquired in 2012.  The remaining increases for the year are due to more long-term program contracts, which resulted in higher contract cost amortization.     The amortization of program contract costs decreased $8.8 million during 2011 compared to 2010.  We had purchased more barter and short-term program contracts which are less expensive and resulted in lower contract cost amortization.     Corporate general and administrative expenses.   See explanation under  Corporate and Unallocated Expenses     Impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets .  We completed our annual test of goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment in fourth quarter 2012, 2011 and 2010.  We recorded no impairment in 2012.  During 2011, we recorded impairments of $0.4 million related to our broadcast licenses.  During 2010, we recorded impairments of $4.8 million related to our broadcast licenses and other assets.     Depreciation and amortization expenses.   Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangibles and other assets increased $32.9 million during 2012 compared 2011, of which $32.2 million related to the stations acquired in 2012.     50          Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $4.6 million during 2011 compared to 2010.  This decrease was primarily due to older assets that were becoming fully depreciated.     OTHER OPERATING DIVISIONS SEGMENT REVENUE AND EXPENSE     The following table presents our other operating divisions segment revenue and expenses which is comprised of the following for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in millions): Triangle Signs & Services, LLC (Triangle), a sign designer and fabricator; Alarm Funding Associates, LLC.

volume due to new service contracts.  The increases in Alarm Fundings revenue and expenses during 2012 compared to 2011 and 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the acquisition of new alarm monitoring contracts.  Revenues and expenses have increased for our consolidated real estate ventures over the same periods due to an increase in leasing activity for operating real estate properties and sales of property under development in 2012 compared to 2011.  As of December 31, 2012, we held $71.7 million of real estate for development and sale.     Income (loss) from Equity and Cost Method Investments.   As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying value of our investments in private equity funds and real estate ventures, accounted for under the equity or cost method, was $27.3 million and $65.9 million in 2012 and $26.3 million and $52.6 million in 2011, respectively.  Results of our equity and cost method investments in private investment funds and real estate ventures are included in income from equity and cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operations.  During 2012, we recorded income of $2.2 million related to certain private investment funds and income of $7.4 million related to our real estate ventures, including a $7.9 million gain on the sale of three of our real estate ventures, partially offset by a $0.9 million impairment charge related to one of our real estate ventures.  During 2011, we recorded income of $2.3 million related to certain private equity funds and income of $1.0 million related to our real estate ventures, including a $1.1 million gain on sale of one of our real estate ventures.  During 2010, we determined three of our investments were impaired, primarily due to decreases in underlying values of our real estate investments, and we recorded impairments totaling $6.7 million.  Additionally, during 2010, we recorded losses of $1.7 million related to other real estate ventures and income of $3.6 million related to certain private equity funds.     CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED EXPENSES                                                        Percent Change    (Increase / (Decrease))

expenses to the broadcast segment.  The explanation that follows combines corporate general and administrative expenses found in the  Broadcast Segment  section with the corporate general and administrative expenses found in this section,  Corporate and Unallocated Expenses .  These results exclude general and administrative costs from our other operating divisions segment which are included in our discussion of expenses in the  Other Operating Divisions Segment  section.     Combined corporate general and administrative expenses increased to $31.7 million in 2012 from $27.2 million in 2011.  This is primarily due to an increase in transaction costs due to our recent acquisitions, an increase in higher group insurance costs and higher employee incentive / performance bonuses.     Combined corporate general and administrative expenses increased to $27.2 million in 2011 from $25.9 million in 2010.  This is primarily due to an increase in employee bonuses, stock-based compensation from the issuance of stock-settled appreciation rights and the issuance of restricted and unrestricted common stock at higher stock prices when compared to 2010.  The increases were partially offset by lower health and other insurance costs.     We expect corporate general and administrative expenses to increase in 2013 compared to 2012.     Interest expense.   Interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the incremental borrowings on our Term Loan A and Term Loan B under our Bank Credit Agreement for our acquisitions in 2012, the issuance of $500.0 million of 6.125% notes in the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as financing costs of $6.3 million related to the amendment of our Bank Credit Agreement, which were incurred in 2012.  The increase in interest was partially offset by a decrease due to the full extinguishment of our 6.0% Notes in the second quarter of 2011.     Interest expense decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to our amending and restating the Bank Credit Agreement in third quarter 2010 and the first quarter 2011, resulting in lower interest rates.  In addition, interest expense decreased due to the redemption of our 8.0% Notes in fourth quarter 2010 and our 6.0% Notes in 2010 and second quarter 2011.  These decreases were partially offset by certain financing costs recorded as interest expense during 2011 and 2010 of $6.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively, related to the amendments to the Bank Credit Agreement, mentioned previously, as well as the amendment in the fourth quarter 2011.     We expect interest expense to increase in 2013 compared to 2012 due to the acquisition financing.     Loss from extinguishment of debt.   During the year ended December 31, 2012, we drew down on our incremental borrowings under the Bank Credit Agreement and wrote off a portion of our deferred financing costs and debt discount on the Term Loan B, resulting in a loss of $0.3 million from extinguishment of debt.     During the year ended December 31, 2011, we amended our Bank Credit Agreement and paid down a portion of our Term Loan B, completed the redemption of all $70.0 million of the remaining 6.0% Notes and repurchased certain of our 8.375% Notes, resulting in a loss of $4.8 million from extinguishment of debt.     Income tax (provision) benefit.    The 2012 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the noncontrolling interest) of $212.1 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.0%.  The 2011 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the noncontrolling interest) of $121.0 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.0%.  The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to a release of valuation allowance of $7.7 million related to certain deferred tax assets of Cunningham, one of our consolidated VIEs, as the weight of all available evidence supports realization of the deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance release determination was based primarily on the sufficiency of forecasted taxable income necessary to utilize NOLs expiring in years 2022  2029.  This VIE files separate income tax returns.  Any resulting tax liabilities are nonrecourse to us and we are not entitled to any benefit resulting from the deferred tax assets of the VIE.     As of December 31, 2012, we had a net deferred tax liability of $235.4 million (including $1.3 million classified as held for sale) as compared to a net deferred tax liability of $242.6 million as of December 31, 2011.  The decrease primarily relates to an increase in deferred tax assets of Cunningham, one of our consolidated VIEs, primarily as a result of a release of valuation allowance.     The 2011 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the noncontrolling interest) of $121.0 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.0%.  The 2010 income tax provision for our pre-tax income from continuing operations (including the effects of the noncontrolling interest) of $117.0 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.4%.  The increase in the effective tax rate from 2011 to 2010 is primarily due to a $2.3 million tax benefit recorded in 2010, predominantly resulting from a change in estimate related to an increased deduction for the recovery of historical losses attributable to a disposition that took place in 2009.     52          As of December 31, 2012, we had $26.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits.  Of this total, $15.0 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) and $6.8 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rates from continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively.  As of December 31, 2011, we had $26.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits.  Of this total, $15.1 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) and $6.8 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rates from continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively. We recognized $1.5 million and $1.3 million of income tax expense for interest related to uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  See  Note 9. Income Taxes  in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     As of December 31, 2012, we had $22.9 million in cash and cash equivalent balances and net negative working capital of approximately $3.2 million.  Cash generated by our operations and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement are used as our primary source of liquidity.  As of December 31, 2012, we had $49.5 million of borrowing capacity available and $48.0 million drawn on our Revolving Credit Facility.  We anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from our operations and borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility and general uncommitted incremental term loan capacity of $500.0 million under our Bank Credit Agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements and working capital needs for the next twelve months.  For our long-term liquidity needs, in addition to the sources described above, we may rely upon the issuance of long-term debt, the issuance of equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for equity, or the sale of non-core assets.  However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital or buyers of our non-core assets will be available, or that the terms of any transactions will be acceptable or advantageous to us.     We drew $180.0 million of the additional term loans to fund the acquisition of assets of Four Points, which closed in January 2012 and drew $350.0 million of the additional term loans to fund the acquisition of assets of Freedom, which closed in April 2012.     On September 20, 2012, we entered into an amendment (the Amendment) of our Bank Credit Agreement. Under the Amendment, we increased our incremental term loan capacity from $300.0 million to $500.0 million. Also under the Amendment, the level of permitted unsecured indebtedness increased from $450.0 million to $850.0 million, subject to certain limitations, and increased our ratio of our First Lien Indebtedness from 3.25 times EBITDA to 3.75 times EBITDA through December 31, 2014 with a decrease to 3.50 times EBITDA through maturity of the agreement. Other amended terms provided us with increased television station acquisition capacity, more flexibility under the other restrictive covenants and prepayments of the existing term loans. There were no changes pertaining to interest rates or maturities of the outstanding debt or commitments under the Bank Credit Agreement.     On October 12, 2012, we issued $500.0 million of Senior Unsecured Notes due on October 1, 2022, pursuant to an indenture (the Indenture) dated October 12, 2012.  The Notes were priced at 100% of their par value and will bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, commencing on April 1, 2013. Prior to October 1, 2017, we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the Indenture.  Beginning on October 1, 2017, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price set forth in the Indenture.  In addition, on or prior to October 1, 2015, we may redeem up to 35% of the Notes using proceeds of certain equity offerings.  We used part of the proceeds of this offering to finance the acquisitions in the fourth quarter, as described under the  Executive Overview , including the acquisition of certain television stations from Newport.  We used the remaining proceeds of this offering to partially fund the special dividend paid in December.     53          Sources and Uses of Cash     The following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in millions):                    2012           2011           2010              Net cash flows from   operating activities           $     237.5           $     148.5           $     155.0                                                                 Cash flows from   (used in) investing activities:                                                  Acquisition of   property and equipment           $     (44.0     )     $     (35.8     )     $     (11.7     )        Acquisition of television   stations           (1,135.3     )                              Decrease (increase)   in restricted cash           58.5           (53.4     )     59.6              Dividends and   distributions from equity and cost method investees           9.6           3.8           0.9              Purchase of alarm   monitoring contracts           (12.5     )     (8.9     )     (10.1     )        Investments in   equity and cost method investees           (24.1     )     (11.6     )     (7.2     )        Other           (1.5     )     (6.3     )     0.4              Net cash flows   (used in) from investing activities           $     (1,149.3     )     $     (112.2     )     $     31.9                                                                 Cash flows from   (used in) financing activities:                                                  Proceeds from notes   payable, commercial bank financing and capital leases           $     1,247.2           $     151.7           $     283.9              Repayments of notes   payable, commercial bank financing and capital leases           (179.3     )     (150.4     )     (427.4     )        Payments for   deferred financing costs           (18.7     )     (5.5     )     (7.0     )        Dividends paid on   Class A and Class B Common Stock           (123.9     )     (38.4     )     (34.2     )        Other           (3.6     )     (2.7     )     (3.4     )        Net cash flows from   (used in) financing activities           $     921.7           $     (45.3     )     $     (188.1     )           Operating Activities     Net cash flows from operating activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.   During 2012, we received more cash receipts from customers, net of cash payments to vendors, partially offset by higher interest and tax payments and the $25.0 million payments to FOX pursuant to the agreements entered into during the second quarter of 2012.     Net cash flows from operating activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.   During 2011, we received less cash receipts from customers, net of cash payments to vendors, in addition to other negative working capital changes, which was partially offset by lower interest and program payments.  Additionally, we received net tax refunds in 2010 compared to net cash taxes paid in 2011.     We expect both interest expense and program payments to increase in 2013 compared to 2012.     Investing Activities     Net cash flows used in investing activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.  This increase is due to $1,135.3 million in payments for acquisitions of television stations, additional investment in equity investees, higher capital expenditures and the purchases of alarm monitoring contracts. This increase was partially offset by the use of the restricted cash held in escrow for our acquisitions and distributions received upon sale of three of our equity method investments during 2012.     With the exception of changes in restricted cash, net cash flows used in investing activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.  During 2011, we had higher capital expenditures primarily for news operations and upgrades to our master control systems in order to upgrade these operations to HD.  Additionally, we made more investments in our other operating divisions.  Restricted cash increased due to amounts required to be deposited in escrow accounts pursuant to the asset purchase agreements with Four Points and Freedom.     In 2013, we anticipate incurring fewer capital expenditures than incurred in 2012.     54          Financing Activities     Net cash flows from financing activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.  During 2012, we drew $530.0 million of incremental term loans to fund the asset acquisitions of both Four Points and Freedom, which closed in January 2012 and April 2012, respectively.   We also issued $500.0 million of Senior Unsecured Notes  and used the proceeds to fund the acquisitions in the fourth quarter. This was slightly offset by higher stock dividends paid in 2012 totaling $1.54 per share, which included the $1.00 per share special dividend paid in December, versus $0.48 per share in 2011, as well as, $13.2 million more in payments for deferred financing costs related to the  incremental borrowings in 2012 .     Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.  During 2011, we amended our Bank Credit Agreement resulting in a new Term Loan A of $115.0 million and reducing our Term Loan B by $45.0 million.  Additionally, we completed the redemption of the remaining $70.0 million of the 6.0% Notes at 100% of the face value of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.  The redemption of the 6.0% Notes was effected in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 6.0% Notes and was funded from the net proceeds of our new Term Loan A. During 2010, we purchased $117.7 million principal amount of our 3.0% Notes, 4.87%% Notes and 6.0% Notes pursuant to a combination of tender offers, put rights and open market purchases. In addition, we fully extinguished the outstanding $224.7 million principal amount of 8.0% Notes.     From time to time, we may repurchase additional outstanding debt and stock on the open market.  We expect to fund any repurchases with cash generated from operating activities and in some cases, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.     During 2011, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends on common stock, of $0.12 per share. Dividends of $0.12 per share were paid in March 2011, June 2011, September 2011 and December 2011, for total dividend payments of $0.48 per share for the year ended December 31, 2011.   During 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share in the months of February and May, which were paid in March and June, and $0.15 per share in the months of August and November, which were paid in September and December.  A special cash dividend of $1.00 per share was also declared in November 2012, which was paid in December, for total dividend payments of $1.54 per share for the year ended December 31, 2012. In February 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.  Future dividends on our common shares, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on several factors including our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, covenant restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.  The Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock holders have the same rights related to dividends.  Under our Bank Credit Agreement, in certain circumstances we may make up to $100.0 million in unrestricted annual cash payments including but not limited to dividends, of which $50.0 million may carry over to the next year.     Contractual Obligations     We have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed.  For example, we are contractually committed to acquire future programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.     The following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2012 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash (in millions):     CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS  (a)                    Total           2013           2014-2015           2016-2017           2018 and    thereafter (b)              Notes payable,   capital leases and commercial bank financing (c), (d)           $     2,954.5           $     150.0           $     305.0           $     1,519.0           $     980.5              Notes and capital   leases payable to affiliates (c)           33.1           4.2           8.6           7.9           12.4              Operating leases           24.8           4.7           8.3           7.5           4.3              Employment   contracts           20.2           11.5           8.2           0.5                         Program content (e)           752.7           191.9           301.4           241.3           18.1              Programming   services (f)           93.6           40.1           26.0           19.2           8.3              Maintenance and   support           9.2           2.4           3.4           3.4                         Other operating   contracts           10.0           0.7           1.3           1.4           6.6              LMA and outsourcing   agreements (g)           0.2           0.1           0.1                                    Investments and   loan commitments (h)           8.9           8.9                                               Total contractual   cash obligations           $     3,907.2           $     414.5           $     662.3           $     1,800.2           $     1,030.2                 55           (a)           Excluded from this table are $26.0 million of accrued unrecognized tax benefits.  Due to inherent uncertainty, we can not make reasonable estimates of the amount and period payments will be made.     (b)           Includes a one-year estimate of $8.3 million in payments related to contracts that automatically renew.  We have not calculated potential payments for years after 2018.     (c)            Includes interest on fixed rate debt and capital leases.  Estimated interest on our recourse variable rate debt has been excluded.  Recourse variable rate debt represents $899.5 million of our $2.3 billion total face value of debt as of December 31, 2012.     (d)           During 2012, we drew $530.0 million of incremental term loans to fund the asset acquisitions of both the Four Points and Freedom stations. Additionally, we issued a private offering of $500.0 million of 6.125% Senior Unsecured Notes to fund the asset acquisition of the Newport stations and other acquisitions.  As of December 31, 2012, we drew $48.0 million on our revolver.  Included in these amounts is debt borrowed by Deerfield which is guaranteed by SBG and totals $20.0 million as of December 31, 2012.     (e)            Our Program content includes contractual amounts owed through the expiration date of the underlying agreement for active and future program contracts, network programming and additional advertising inventory in various dayparts. Active program contracts are included in the balance sheet as an asset and liability while future program contracts are excluded until the cost is known, the program is available for its first showing or telecast and the licensee has accepted the program.  Industry protocol typically enables us to make payments for program contracts on a three-month lag, which differs from the contractual timing within the table.  Network programming agreements may include variable fee components such as subscriber levels, which in certain circumstances have been estimated and reflected in the table.     (f)             Includes obligations related to rating service fees, music license fees, market research, weather and news services.     (g)            Excluded from the table are estimated amounts due pursuant to LMAs and outsourcing agreements where we consolidate the counterparty. The fees that we are required to pay under these agreements total $5.8 million, $11.5 million, $3.5 million and $1.6 million for the periods 2013, 2014-2015, 2016-2017 and 2018 and thereafter, respectively. Certain station related operating expenses are paid by the licensee and reimbursed by us under the LMA agreements. Certain of these expenses that are in connection with contracts are included in table above.     (h)           Commitments to contribute capital or provide loans to Allegiance Capital, LP, Sterling Ventures Partners, LP and Patriot Capital II, LP.     Off Balance Sheet Arrangements     Off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the SEC means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party, under which the registrant has:  obligations under certain guarantees or contracts; retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements; obligations under certain derivative arrangements; and obligations arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. As of December 31, 2012, we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.     56          ITEM 7A.                                         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates.  At times we enter into derivative instruments primarily for the purpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt.  See  Note 6. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing,  in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  As of December 31, 2012, we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments.     In January 2012, we drew $180.0 million of the incremental Term Loan B under our Bank Credit Agreement to fund the asset acquisition of Four Points, which closed January 1, 2012. In addition, in April 2012, we drew $157.5 million of the incremental Term Loan A and $192.5 million of the incremental Term Loan B under our Bank Credit Agreement to fund the asset acquisition of Freedom, which closed April 1, 2012.  As of December 31, 2012, we had $48.0 million drawn on our revolver.     On September 20, 2012, we entered into an amendment of our Bank Credit Agreement. Under the Amendment, we increased our incremental term loan capacity from $300.0 million to $500.0 million. Also under the Amendment, the level of permitted unsecured indebtedness increased from $450.0 million to $850.0 million, subject to certain limitations, and we increased our ratio of our First Lien Indebtedness from 3.25 times EBITDA to 3.75 times EBITDA through December 31, 2014 with a decrease to 3.50 times EBITDA through maturity of the agreement. Other amended terms provided us with increased television station acquisition capacity, more flexibility under the other restrictive covenants and prepayments of the existing term loans. There were no changes pertaining to interest rates or maturities of the outstanding debt or commitments under the Bank Credit Agreement.     We are exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred.  The carrying value and fair value of the 4.875% Notes, 3.0% Notes, 6.125% Notes, 8.375% Notes and 9.25% Notes combined was $1,236.5 million and $1,362.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2012.  We estimate that adding 1.0% to prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of these notes by $70.7 million as of December 31, 2012.  Generally, the fair market value of these notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall.  We are also exposed to risk from the changing interest rates of our variable rate debt, primarily related to our Bank Credit Agreement.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash interest expense on our term loans and revolver related to our Bank Credit Agreement was $27.9 million.  We estimate that adding 1.0% to respective interest rates would result in an increase in our interest expense of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.  We also have variable rate debt associated with our other operating divisions.  We estimate that adding 1.0% to respective interest rates would result in $0.6 million of additional interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012.     Under certain circumstances, we have contingent cash interest features related to the 3.0% Notes and the 4.875% Notes.  The contingent cash interest feature for both issuances were embedded derivatives which have negligible fair values.     ITEM 8.                                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
