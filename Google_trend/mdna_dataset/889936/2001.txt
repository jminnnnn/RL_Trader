ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview              PrivateBancorp was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1989 to serve as the holding company for a Chicago-based de novo (start-up) bank. Our flagship downtown Chicago location opened in 1991. We expanded to Wilmette in north suburban Cook County in 1994 and the Oak Brook facility in west suburban DuPage County was established in 1997. We established the St. Charles office in January 2000, in connection with our purchase of Towne Square Financial Corporation (a company which was in the process of forming a de novo, or start-up bank) on August 3, 1999. On February 11, 2000, we consummated our acquisition of Johnson Bank Illinois adding two additional locations of The PrivateBank (Chicago) in Lake Forest and Winnetka, Illinois. During the second quarter 2000, we received regulatory approval to create a new banking subsidiary and on June 23, 2000, PrivateBancorp capitalized The PrivateBank (St. Louis).              Since year-end 1995 to December 31, 2000, we have grown our asset base at a compound annual rate of 33.9% to $829.5 million. During the same period, loans have grown at a compound annual rate of 36.9% to $599.4 million, deposits at a compound annual rate of 30.8% to $670.2 million and trust assets under administration at a compound annual rate of 30.7% to $777.8 million.              For financial information regarding our four separate lines of business, The PrivateBank (Chicago), The PrivateBank (St. Louis), Trust Services and Holding Company Activities, see "Note 2 -- Operating Segments" to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2000, included on page F-9.              The profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest-earning assets as compared to the amounts and rates on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset/liability management strategy. The provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio, management's assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio, loss experience, as well as economic and market factors.              Non-interest income consists primarily of trust fee income, and to a lesser extent, net securities gains and fees for ancillary banking services. Non-interest income from fees and deposit service charges are below peer group levels. This is largely the result of the profile of our typical client. Our clients tend to have larger deposit account balances than customers of traditional banks. Because average balances tend to be high, we do not earn high service charge income typical of many retail banks.              Non-interest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations. Our growth directly affects the majority of our expense categories. Profitability and expense ratios were negatively impacted in 2000 due to the start-up operation of the St. Charles office, the acquisition of Johnson Bank Illinois, and the opening of The PrivateBank (St. Louis). During 2001, we expect to continue to incur operating expenses in excess of revenues for The PrivateBank (St. Louis).                                         23               On June 30, 1999, we sold 900,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering at $18 per share. The closing date of the offering was July 6, 1999, when we received net proceeds of approximately $14.4 million (after deduction of offering expenses). On July 26, 1999, an additional 135,000 shares were sold pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of their over allotment option for additional net proceeds of $2.3 million. The year to date earnings per share calculation as of December 31, 1999 does not equal the sum of the individual quarter earnings per share amounts. Based upon the application of FASB Statement No. 128, "Earnings per Share," a difference arises that is attributable to the impact of our initial public offering which closed in July 1999, and the acquisition of Town Square Financial Corporation during the third quarter 1999.                         CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Net Income              Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $4.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared to $2.9 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 1999. Excluding one-time charges, our earnings were $4.8 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in 2000 and $4.5 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in 1999.              Net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 included a previously announced one-time charge of $377,000 after-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share, comprised of severance packages for two departing executives as well as amounts incurred to secure their replacements. Net income for the year ended December 31, 1999, included an acquisition charge of $1.4 million after-tax, or $0.29 per diluted share, related to the acquisition of Towne Square Financial Corporation in St. Charles, Illinois and the start-up expenses of The PrivateBank (St. Louis). The earnings growth of 6.5% between 2000 and 1999 is due to growth in net interest income and non-interest income offset by higher operating expenses. Net income in 2000 includes the financial results of the former Johnson Bank Illinois locations subsequent to their acquisition on February 11, 2000. Excluding the effects of goodwill amortization and acquisition interest expense associated with the transaction, the two offices located in Winnetka and Lake Forest have contributed $1.0 million to our net income in 2000.              Net income for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $2.9 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to $3.0 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 1998. Excluding the Towne Square Financial Corporation acquisition-related charge and St. Louis start-up costs, 1999 earnings were $4.5 million, an increase of 50% over 1998 net income. Before these one-time charges, 1999 earnings per diluted share were $1.07, a 24% increase over 1998 earnings per diluted share of $0.86.              The increase in earnings from operations before one-time charges is primarily attributable to growth in the balance sheet, particularly in loans, and improvement in our net interest margin. Increased fee income, mainly from trust services, also contributed to the improvement in income before one-time charges.              The tables below show the computation of earnings from operations before one-time charges for 2000 and 1999.

Net Interest Income              Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period. Net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings. Interest income includes loan origination fees recorded from loans. The volume of non-interest bearing funds, largely comprised of demand deposits and capital, also affects the net interest margin.              Net interest income was $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $15.5 million for 1999, an increase of 54.0%. Net interest income is affected by both the volume of assets and liabilities held and the corresponding rates earned and paid. The increase in net interest income for 2000 is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets. Average earning assets for 2000 were $671.5 million compared to $432.2 million for 1999, an increase of 76.2%. Our net interest margin was 3.63% for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to 3.79% for the prior year. Although the rising interest rate environment which was in effect during the first six months of 2000 had the effect of improving the yield on average earning assets during 2000 as compared to 1999, the rates paid on deposits and other borrowed funds also increased in 2000 as compared to 1999, resulting in reduced net interest spread for 2000 as compared to 1999. The decrease in net interest margin is primarily attributable to an increase in borrowed funds utilized to complete the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition and to capitalize The PrivateBank (St. Louis). The effect of non-interest bearing deposits added 61 basis points to 2000 net interest margin.              We expect that we will likely experience margin pressure during 2001 if we continue to experience a falling interest rate environment during 2001. As interest rates decline, the portion of our loan portfolio that is based on floating rates will re-price downward. Likewise, our deposits and floating rate borrowings will re-price downward as well. However, effective February 8, 2001, we increased our fixed rate borrowings through the issuance of $20.0 million trust preferred securities. These securities are accounted for as long-term debt and pay interest at the fixed rate of 9.50%. The effect of the trust preferred issuance will be to compress interest margin in a falling interest rate environment.              Net interest income was $15.5 million during the year ended December 31, 1999, compared to $12.0 million for 1998, an increase of 29.1%. The increase in 1999 was primarily attributable to growth in earning assets and, to a lesser extent, improvement in net interest spread. Average earning assets during 1999 were $432.2 million compared to $331.6 million for 1998, an increase of 30.3%. Our net interest margin was 3.79% for the year ended December 31, 1999, compared to 3.64% for the prior year. The increase in net interest margin was attributable to a favorable shift in the mix of earning assets resulting in a higher percentage of average loans to total average assets and to the benefit in 1999 of investing the proceeds of our initial public offering in interest-earning assets. In 1999, the effect of non-interest bearing funds on the net interest margin added 64 basis points to the margin.                                          25               The following table presents a summary of our net interest income and related net interest margin, calculated on a tax equivalent basis (dollars in thousands):                                                                             Year Ended December 31,                                            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       2000                         1999                             1998                                            --------------------------  -----------------------------    ---------------------------                                             Average                     Average                          Average                                             Balance  Interest   Rate    Balance   Interest     Rate      Balance  Interest    Rate                                             -------  --------   ----    -------   --------     ----      -------  --------    ----                    Federal funds sold and other short-term     investments .......................... $ 17,032  $  1,058   6.11%  $  6,557   $    329     5.02%    $ 40,230  $  2,181    5.42% Investment securities(2) .................  114,144     8,339   7.31%    93,903      6,055     6.45%      57,427     3,576    6.23% Loans, net of unearned discount(3) .......  540,297    48,634   8.92%   331,698     26,598     8.02%     233,987    19,620    8.39%                                            --------  --------          --------   --------              --------  --------     Total earning assets ................. $671,473  $ 58,031   8.57%  $432,158   $ 32,982     7.63%    $331,644  $ 25,377    7.65%                                            ========  ========          ========   ========              ========  ======== Deposits--interest bearing:     Interest-bearing demand accounts ..... $ 37,415  $    869   2.32%  $ 27,248        604     2.22%    $ 22,073       487    2.21%     Savings and money market deposits ....  267,597    13,711   5.12%   184,192      7,707     4.18%     151,558     6,651    4.39%     Time deposits ........................  235,049    14,635   6.23%   141,481      7,364     5.20%     111,407     6,155    5.52%                                            --------  --------          --------   --------              --------  --------         Total interest-bearing deposits ..  540,061    29,215   5.39%   352,921     15,675     4.44%     285,038    13,293    4.66% Funds borrowed ...........................   58,160     4,116   6.96%    17,500        931     5.32%         373        19    5.09%                                            --------  --------          --------   --------              --------  --------         Total interest bearing liabilities $598,221  $ 33,331   5.55%  $370,421   $ 16,606     4.48%    $285,411  $ 13,312    4.66%                                            ========  ========          ========   ========              ========  ======== Tax equivalent net interest income .......           $ 24,700                     $ 16,376                        $ 12,065                                                      ========                     ========                        ======== Net interest spread ......................                      3.02%                          3.15%                          2.99% Net interest margin ......................                      3.63%                          3.79%                          3.64%  - ---------------- (1)  Average balances were generally computed using daily balances. (2)  Interest income on tax advantaged investment securities reflects a tax      equivalent adjustment based on a marginal federal corporate tax rate of      34%. The total tax equivalent adjustment reflected in the above table is      approximately $885,000, $914,000 and $85,000 in the years ending 2000, 1999      and 1998, respectively. (3)  Non-accrual loans are included in the average balances and do not have a      material effect on the average yield. Interest on non-accruing loans was      not material for the periods presented.              The following table shows the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense by major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities attributable to changes in volume or rate or a mix of both, for the periods indicated, calculated on a tax equivalent basis.

The provision for loan losses reflects management's latest assessment of the inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Our allowance for probable loan losses is reassessed monthly to determine the appropriate level of the reserve. Our analysis is influenced by the following factors: the volume and quality of loans and commitments in the portfolio, loss experience, and economic conditions. A discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the factors on which provisions are based begins on page 31.                                         26               Our provision for loan losses was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $1.2 million for the comparable period in 1999. Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $956,000 and $108,000, respectively. Our provision for loan loss was $362,000 in 1998 and we recognized $2,000 of net charge-offs during 1998.  Non-interest Income              Non-interest income increased approximately $1.2 million or 58.1%, to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $2.0 million for 1999. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in service charge income and trust fee revenues. Banking service charge income increased by $456,083 over the prior year due primarily to fees earned on accounts related to the former Johnson Bank Illinois offices in Winnetka and Lake Forest. Trust fee revenue increased 43.8% to $2.3 million in 2000 compared to $1.6 million in 1999. Trust assets under administration increased 6.5% to $777.8 million at year end 2000, compared to $730.0 million at December 31, 1999. In February 2000, the acquisition of Johnson Bank Illinois added approximately $60.0 million to trust assets under administration. During 2000 we expanded our trust services beyond the Chicago office with the addition of trust staff to our suburban offices. We expect to expand our trust services to The PrivateBank (St. Louis) during 2001.              Non-interest income increased approximately $683,000, or 51.7%, to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, compared to $1.3 million for 1998. Trust fees grew 60.0% to $1.6 million in 1999, reflecting a restructuring of trust fee schedules and growth in trust assets under administration to $730.0 million at year end 1999 compared to $612.0 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of 19.3%.              Total non-interest income also included $92,000, $57,000 and $40,000 in realized gains from sales of investment securities during 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

The 2000 results reflect a one-time severance charge of $562,000 relating to severance packages for two departing executives and costs incurred in connection with the recruitment and hiring of their replacements.              Excluding one-time charges, non-interest expense increased 74.7% from $10.3 million during 1999 to $18.0 million during 2000. A portion of the increase is attributable to goodwill amortization of $731,000 recorded during 2000 resulting from the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition, which closed on February 11, 2000. The remainder of the increase over the prior year level is also primarily due to expenses incurred in connection with our expansion initiatives.                                          27               Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes operating expenses of $1.1 million and $1.4 million related to the St. Charles and the St. Louis offices, respectively. Additionally, 2000 results reflect the addition of the two new locations acquired through the Johnson Bank Illinois transaction which increased operating expenses by $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 in addition to the $731,000 of goodwill amortization recognized during 2000 in connection with the acquisition. The remaining increase in non-interest expense of approximately $2.2 million is due to overall growth in salaries and benefits, professional services and marketing costs at our existing offices.              Included in total non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1999, is the one-time $1.3 million charge associated with the acquisition of Towne Square Financial Corporation, as well as $133,200 of transaction costs associated with the acquisition. The $1.3 million non-recurring charge is not tax deductible. Excluding the effect of the one-time charges in 1999, non-interest expense increased 33.3% in 1999 to $10.8 million compared to $8.1 million for 1998. Non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets changed from 2.3% in 1998 to 2.7% in 1999 to 2.6% in 2000.              Our efficiency ratio (tax equivalent), which measures the percentage of net revenue that is paid as non-interest expense, for the year ended December 31, 2000 was 66.8% compared to 65.8% for the year ended December 31, 1999 and 60.8% for the year ended December 31, 1998. Excluding the effects of one-time charges during 2000 and 1999, our efficiency ratio increased to 64.8% in 2000 from 57.5% in 1999 and from 60.8% in 1998.              Our efficiency ratio for 2000 was negatively impacted due to the start-up nature of the St. Charles office and the St. Louis office. Our St. Charles office first broke even on a monthly basis in July, 2000, approximately within one year of the acquisition date. During 2001, we expect to continue to incur operating expenses in excess of revenues for The PrivateBank (St. Louis). We expect the efficiency ratio to remain high until business development efforts at the new offices generate revenue sufficient to offset the related operating expenses.              The following table shows our operating efficiency (excluding one-time charges) over the last three years:                                                                December 31,                                                      --------------------------                                                       2000(1) 1999(2)    1998                                                      -------- -------  --------                  Non-interest expense to average assets       2.56%    2.32%    2.29%           Net overhead ratio(3) ................       2.11     1.87     1.91           Efficiency ratio(4) ..................      64.75    57.52    60.80   (1)  Excludes the one-time severance charge incurred in 2000 in the amount of      $562,000. (2)  Excludes the one-time charges relating to the Towne Square Financial      Corporation acquisition and the St. Louis start-up costs totaling      $1,757,000. (3)  Non-interest expense less non-interest income divided by average total      assets. (4)  Non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income, on a tax      equivalent basis, plus non-interest income.              Salary and employee benefit expense increased 58.5% to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Full-time equivalent employees increased 49.7% to 137 at December 31, 2000 from 91.5 at December 31, 1999. The increase in salary and benefits is due primarily to an increased number of employees, including the senior officers, responsible for opening the St. Charles and St. Louis offices, as well as the addition of employees from the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition. Our main office in Chicago has also experienced growth in personnel during 2000 in response to the overall growth of the organization and to increased staffing needs to support a public company.              Salary and employee benefit expense increased 26.5% to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Full-time-equivalent employees increased 28% to 91.5 at December 31, 1999 from 71.5 at December 31, 1998. The increase in salary and benefits for 1999 was affected by the start up of the St. Charles office. In addition, we incurred approximately $262,000 in salary-related expense in connection with the formation of the St. Louis office. A portion of the increase in salaries and benefits is                                          28   attributable to a general increase in our staffing resulting from growth and increased staffing needs to support a public company.              Professional fees, which include legal, accounting, consulting services and investment management fees, increased 64.9% to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $1.3 for 1999. The increase in 2000 is primarily due to higher legal, accounting and information-system consultation services. These projects included the system merger completed in connection with the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition, implementation of a new asset liability management software program and various other projects which relate to general upgrades of our current technology infrastructure. In addition, the increase in trust-related business has resulted in increased investment management fees paid to third parties during the year ended December 31, 2000 in addition to December 31, 1999.              Professional fees increased 130.8% to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $561,000 for 1998. The increase in 1999 is due to a number of factors including increased consulting services rendered in 1999 relating to year 2000 readiness. During the third quarter of 1999, we completed our data processing conversion to a new third-party provider. We incurred $145,000 of consulting expenses related to the data processing conversion during the third quarter 1999. Included in professional fees for the 1999 period are approximately $95,000 of non-recurring legal and accounting fees associated with the Towne Square acquisition and $13,000 of legal fees related to the start-up costs of the St. Louis office.              System related projects are expected to continue in 2001. During 2001, we plan to invest approximately $1.3 million in our information technology infrastructure. These expenditures will result in new hardware, innovative software and overall integration of our various technology components. The upgrade to our information technology platform is being undertaken as a result of an independent third-party assessment of our current operating environment, which was conducted during 2000. The 2001 information technology renovation will augment the technology expenditures that have been made in 1999 and 2000 in connection with the implementation of a new data processing system, upgrades to our Internet banking products, web page development and other system related projects that have increased our customer service capabilities.              The other expense category of non-interest expense consists primarily of postage, telephone, delivery, office supplies, training and other miscellaneous expenses. During 2000 these expenses increased relative to 1999 by 21.8% due to the implementation of our expansion strategy. During 1999 these expenses increased relative to 1998 by 61.0%. The increase of other expenses for 1999 is attributable to the establishment of the St. Louis and St. Charles offices, training incurred in connection with the new data processing system and a general increase in business volumes during 1999.  Income Taxes              The following table shows our income before income taxes, applicable income taxes and effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.                                                                Year Ended December 31,                                                         -------------------------------                                                            2000       1999       1998                                                         ---------  ---------- ---------                                                              (dollars in thousands)                       Income before taxes.................       $6,688     $4,172    $4,849                Income tax provision................        2,263      1,257     1,839                Effective tax rate..................         33.8%      30.1%     37.9%               The effective income tax rate varies from statutory rates principally due to certain interest income which is tax-exempt for federal or state purposes, and certain expenses (including the Towne Square acquisition charge) which are disallowed for tax purposes. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2000 as compared to 1999 reflects a lower amount of interest income which was tax exempt in 2000 relative to 1999. Decreases in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to 1998 resulted from the increase of our municipal bond portfolio as a percentage of total investment securities. The average balance of municipal securities was $37.1 million, $39.5 million and $25.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,                                          29   respectively. The impact of increased non-taxable income in 1999 was offset by the one-time non-tax deductible special charge related to the Towne Square acquisition.                                  FINANCIAL CONDITION  Total Assets              Total assets were $829.5 million at December 31, 2000, an increase of $310.8 million, or 59.9%, over the $518.7 million at December 31, 1999. The balance sheet growth resulted from the acquisition of Johnson Bank Illinois, the start-up of a new office in St. Charles, Illinois, the establishment of The PrivateBank (St. Louis) and asset growth from our existing bank offices in the Chicago metropolitan area. The growth in assets experienced during 2000 was funded primarily through growth in deposits, including brokered deposits, and to a lesser extent, through increased borrowings.  Loans              Total loans increased to $599.4 million at December 31, 2000, an increase of $202.2 or 50.9%, from $397.3 at December 31, 1999.              The increase in loans of $202.2 million is partially attributable to the addition of the Winnetka and Lake Forest loan portfolios, which added $86.3 million in loans in February 2000 as a result of the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition. The remaining growth experienced during 2000 is the result of the opening of the St. Charles office and the start-up of The PrivateBank (St. Louis), in addition to continued growth from our existing offices.              The following table sets forth the loan portfolio by category as of December 31 for the previous five fiscal years:                                                      Year Ended December 31,                                       2000       1999       1998       1997       1996                                     --------   --------   --------   --------   --------                                                        (in thousands)                      Commercial real estate    $206,464   $146,368   $ 94,392   $ 55,429   $ 39,452           Commercial ............    137,343     67,026     46,800     33,862     28,004           Residential real estate     86,052     72,972     54,171     56,307     45,012           Personal ..............     62,414     57,497     44,094     42,077     35,339           Home equity ...........     46,013     24,396     20,100     20,680     20,683           Construction ..........     61,143     29,018     22,408     10,140      2,853                                     --------   --------   --------   --------   --------               Total loans .......   $599,429   $397,277   $281,965   $218,495   $171,343                                     ========   ========   ========   ========   ========               The following table classifies the loan portfolio, by category, at December 31, 2000, by date at which the loans mature:                              One year  From one to After five             More than one year                           or less   five years    years      Total     Fixed    Variable(1)                           --------  ----------- ---------- --------  ---------- -----------                                                   (in thousands)              Commercial real estate    $ 52,475   $104,002   $ 49,987   $206,464   $ 70,537   $ 83,452 Commercial ............     82,272     47,965      7,106    137,343     21,880     33,191 Residential real estate      6,749     15,138     64,165     86,052     19,124     60,179 Personal ..............     53,307      7,780      1,327     62,414      2,657      6,450 Home equity ...........      7,245     24,299     14,469     46,013         --     38,768 Construction ..........     51,049      9,309        785     61,143        476      9,618                           --------   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------     Total loans .......   $253,097   $208,493   $137,839   $599,429   $114,674   $231,658                           ========   ========   ========   ========   ========   ========   (1)  Includes adjustable rate mortgage products.                                          30   Allowance for Loan Losses              We believe our loan loss experience to date reflects the high credit quality of our loan portfolio.

The amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses which is charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses is determined based on a variety of factors, including assessment of the credit risk of the portfolio, delinquent loans, evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area, actual charge-offs during the year and historical loss experience. The unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations, including management's view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses.                                           31               We maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by all available and relevant information. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. We believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio.              The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.02% as of December 31, 2000, compared to 1.14% as of December 31, 1999. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $956,000 and $108,000, respectively. Net charge-offs to average total loans were 0.18% for 2000 compared to 0.03% for 1999. The increase in net charge-offs during 2000 is due primarily to a single commercial credit relationship. In management's judgment, an adequate allowance for loan losses has been established.  Non-performing Loans              The following table classifies our non-performing loans as of the dates shown:                                                             December 31,                                        ----------------------------------------------                                         2000      1999      1998      1997      1996                                        ------    ------    ------    ------    ------                                                    (dollars in thousands)            Nonaccrual loans ...................   $   24    $  600    $   --    $   --    $   -- Loans past due 90 days or more .....    1,421       223     1,016       527     1,116                                        ------    ------    ------    ------    ------     Total non-performing loans .....    1,445       823     1,016       527     1,116                                        ------    ------    ------    ------    ------ Other real estate owned ............       --        --        --        --        --                                        ------    ------    ------    ------    ------     Total non-performing assets ....   $1,445    $  823    $1,016    $  527    $1,116                                        ======    ======    ======    ======    ====== Total non-performing loans to total     loans ..........................     0.24%     0.21%     0.36%     0.24%     0.65% Total non-performing assets to total     0.17%     0.16%     0.24%     0.17%     0.45%     assets               It is our policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which there exists reasonable doubt as to the payment of interest or principal. Nonaccrual loans are returned to an accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest.              Other than those loans reflected in the table above, we had no significant loans for which the terms had been renegotiated or restructured, or for which there were serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with repayment terms. We did not have any other real estate owned as of any of the dates shown.              Potential Problem Loans. In addition to those loans reflected in the table above, we have identified some loans through our problem loan identification process which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk. Loans in this category include those with characteristics such as past maturity more than 90 days, those that have recent adverse operating cash flow or balance sheet trends, or loans that have general risk characteristics that management believes might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments. The balance in this category at any reporting period can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiations and renewals. The principal amount of loans in this category as of December 31, 2000 was $1,421,000. At December 31, 2000, there were no significant loans which were classified by any bank regulatory agency that are not included above as nonaccrual, past due or restructured.              Loan Concentrations. Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. Other than loans made to borrowers residing in the Chicago and St. Louis metropolitan areas and our involvement in lending secured by real estate, we had no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans at December 31, 2000.                                          32               Nonaccrual loans decreased to $24,000 as of December 31, 2000 from $600,000 as of December 31, 1999. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 1999 included one residential real estate loan that comprised approximately $538,000 of the amount at that date. This loan was charged off during 2000.              Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and accruing loans which are 90 days or more delinquent. Nonperforming loans were $1,445,000 as of December 31, 2000, compared to $823,000 at December 31, 1999. Nonperforming loans were 0.24%, and 0.21% of total loans at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively. Nonperforming loans were 0.17% and 0.16% of total assets as of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively.  Investment Securities              Investments are comprised of federal funds sold, debt securities and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. "Federal funds sold" are overnight investments in which, except for cash reserves, all remaining funds are invested. Our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government agency obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed pools and collateralized mortgage obligations.              All securities are classified as available-for-sale and may be sold as part of our asset/liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with related unrealized net gains or losses, net of deferred income taxes, recorded as an adjustment to equity capital. At December 31, 2000, reported stockholders' equity was reduced by unrealized securities losses net of tax of $118,000. This represented an improvement of $2.7 million from unrealized securities losses net of tax of $2.8 million at December 31, 1999.              Securities available-for-sale increased to $172.2 million at December 31, 2000, up 142.1% from $71.1 million as of December 31, 1999. The increase in investment securities is partially attributable to the acquisition of the Johnson Bank Illinois portfolio. Following the acquisition of Johnson Bank Illinois, we sold approximately $9.7 million of the former Johnson Bank Illinois investment securities portfolio as part of our realignment of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The proceeds from the sale of investment securities were reinvested in U.S. government agency securities. Increased liquidity which resulted from loan participations that were sold in the third and fourth quarters of 2000, was invested in U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, in connection with the execution of our interest rate risk management strategy. During the fourth quarter of 2000, we sold approximately $25.6 million of collateralized mortgage obligations at a gain of approximately $95,000 and replaced them with mortgage-backed pools to enhance our interest rate risk management strategy. In addition, we sold approximately $2.8 million of municipal bonds at a loss of approximately $95,000 and replaced them with municipal bonds at current market rates to take advantage of favorable tax treatment as well as enhance our interest rate risk management strategy. In addition, we purchased $32.6 million of additional Federal Home Loan Bank stock, $31.7 million as a short-term investment alternative and $900,000 of which is to support additional borrowings.

Funds are swept      each business day from the client's demand deposit account. These amounts      are not deposits and are not insured, but are secured by a pool of      securities pledged specifically for this purpose. (2)  The rate on this FHLB floating rate advance is set at one-month LIBOR minus      five basis points.              Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System gives us the ability to borrow funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines for short- or long-term purposes under a variety of programs. We have periodically used services of the FHLB for short-term funding needs and other correspondent services.              During 2000, we increased our utilization of Federal Home Loan Bank advances to fund loan growth. Management anticipates that our reliance on Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings as a funding source will likely remain at current levels in 2001 to the extent that rates on Federal Home Loan Bank advances continue to be more attractive than deposit pricing. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings totaled $68.5 million at December 31, 2000 compared to $15.0 million at December 31, 1999, all of which were at that time fixed advances maturing in less than three months.              At December 31, 2000, we had $20.3 million in FHLB letters of credit outstanding. At December 31, 1999, we had $21.4 million in FHLB letters of credit outstanding. We pay 0.125% per annum for FHLB letters of credit. The following table shows the maximum availability for and usage of FHLB advances and letters of credit for The PrivateBank (Chicago) and The PrivateBank (St. Louis).

Typically, these municipal entities require that banks pledge marketable securities to collateralize these public deposits. The State of Illinois also accepts FHLB letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, we had approximately $33.7 million and $17.5 million, respectively, of securities collateralizing such public deposits. Deposits requiring pledged assets are not considered to be core deposits, and the assets that are pledged as collateral for these deposits are not deemed to be liquid assets.              On February 11, 2000, we entered into a new, two-year, $18.0 million revolving credit facility. We borrowed $7.5 million under the line in connection with the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition at an initial rate of 7.20%. During the second quarter 2000, we increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility by approximately $8.0 million in order to capitalize The PrivateBank (St. Louis). During the third and fourth quarters of 2000, we increased our borrowings under the revolving credit facility by approximately $1.75 million and $750,000, respectively, for business operating purposes. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving line resets quarterly, and is based on, at our option, either the lender's prime rate or a 90-day LIBOR-based rate. The interest rate on the revolving line reset to 7.60% on January 2, 2001.              We also issued a $5.0 million subordinated note to Johnson International, Inc. as partial payment of the purchase price of the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition. The interest rate on the subordinated note resets each quarter based on the 90-day LIBOR rate. The note is payable in full on or before February 11, 2007, and provides for certain rate escalation beginning after two years. The initial rate of interest on the subordinated note was 6.60% and reset to 5.89% on February 12, 2001.              On February 8, 2001, we issued $20.0 million in trust preferred securities at a fixed rate of 9.50% which mature on December 31, 2030. At our option, the securities may be redeemed prior to maturity on or after December 31, 2005. The trust preferred securities will be presented in our consolidated balance sheet as "Long-term debt-trust preferred securities." Upon receipt of the net proceeds of $18.9 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses and including the underwriters' over-allotment shares, we repaid the full amount of borrowings under our revolving line of credit with a commercial bank in the amount of $18.0 million. As of March 22, 2001, borrowings under the revolving line of credit were $0 and the maximum amount available under the line of credit is $18.0 million.  Capital Resources              Stockholders' equity at December 31, 2000 rose to $54.2 million, an increase of $7.2 million from the 1999 year-end level of $47.1 million, due primarily to the increase in net income from the year ended December 31, 2000 as well as the change in the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale net of tax. During July 1999, we raised approximately $16.7 million in capital (net of commissions and offering costs) through the issuance of 1,035,000 shares of our common stock in our initial public offering.              We are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors, and the regulators can lower classifications in certain areas. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements.              The prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If a banking subsidiary is not "well capitalized," regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited as is asset growth and expansion and plans for capital restoration are required.                                          37               The following table reflects various consolidated measures of our capital at December 31, 2000 and 1999:                                                                   December 31,                                                       --------------------------------                                                                 Pro forma                                                        2000        2000         1999                                                       ------      ------      --------        Leverage ratio......................................   5.54%        7.88%      10.77% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio.....................   6.47         9.21       12.84 Total risk-based capital ratio......................   8.15        11.18       13.96 Total equity to total assets........................   6.53         6.53        9.08               The pro forma ratios presented for 2000 in the table above reflect the impact of the issuance of $20.0 million of trust preferred securities assuming the issuance had occurred on December 31, 2000. As of such date, the trust preferred securities would have been included in Tier 1 capital in the amount of $18.1 million. The Tier 1 qualifying amount is limited to 25.0% of Tier 1 capital under Federal Reserve regulations. The excess amount of $1.9 million pro forma as of December 31, 2000 qualifies as Tier 2 capital.              The subordinated note in the amount of $5.0 million which was issued to Johnson International as consideration in connection with the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes.              To be considered "well capitalized," an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. To be "adequately capitalized," an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%. At December 31, 2000, we continued to exceed the minimum levels of all regulatory capital requirements, and were considered "adequately capitalized" under regulatory standards. At December 31, 2000, our total risk-based capital ratio was 8.15%. With the exception of the total risk-based capital ratio, we exceeded the "well-capitalized" levels of our regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2000, The PrivateBank (Chicago) and The PrivateBank (St. Louis) were considered "well-capitalized" under all applicable regulatory standards, including total risk-based capital ratio.  Liquidity              Liquidity measures our ability to meet maturing obligations and our existing commitments, to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels, to fund our operations and to provide for our clients' credit needs. Our liquidity principally depends on our cash flows from our operating activities, investment in and maturity of assets, changes in balances of deposits and borrowings and our ability to borrow funds in the money or capital markets. Liquidity management involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost. Liquidity management is guided by policies, formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks' asset/liability committees, which take into account the marketability of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments. Our principal sources of funds are deposits, short-term borrowings and capital contributions by PrivateBancorp to the banks funded by proceeds from draws on our line of credit or through new capital.              Our core deposits, the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long-term relationships generally established with our clients, are available to provide long-term liquidity. At December 31, 2000, 70.8% of our total assets were funded by core deposits. At December 31, 1999, 79.6% of our total assets were funded by core deposits. Core deposits are defined to include all deposits including time deposits but excluding brokered deposits and public funds. Time deposits are included as core deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us.              Over the past several years, our clients have chosen to keep the maturities of their deposits short. We expect these short-term certificates of deposit to be renewed on terms and with maturities similar to those currently in place. In the event that certain of these certificates of deposit are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank, unless those deposits are replaced with traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowed money or capital, we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs.                                          38               We have continued to use Federal Home Loan Bank advances and brokered deposits as alternative methods of funding loan growth. During 1999, we first utilized brokered deposits as a funding tool to enhance liquidity in anticipation of increasing loan demand and year 2000 contingency planning. During 2000 we expanded our brokered deposits program in order to fund liquidity of The PrivateBank (Chicago). During 2001 we expect to continue to rely on brokered deposits together with increased Federal Home Loan Bank advances as alternative methods of funding loan growth. We will first look toward internally generated deposits as funding sources, but plan to supplement our funding needs with non-traditional funding sources as needed. We anticipate that our average cost of funds will increase in 2001 compared to 2000 due to the increased reliance on non-traditional funding sources. We expect that The PrivateBank (St. Louis) will begin to purchase brokered deposits in 2001 as well, in the absence of traditional deposit growth sufficient to fund the expected loan growth in that market.              Liquid assets refers to money market assets such as federal funds sold, as well as available-for-sale securities. Net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds. At December 31, 2000, net liquid assets at The PrivateBank (Chicago) were $137.1 million as compared to $79.5 million at December 31, 1999. At December 31, 2000, net liquid assets at The PrivateBank (St. Louis) were $1.9 million.              Net cash inflows provided by operations were $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to a net inflow of $3.2 million a year earlier. Net cash outflows from investing activities were $232.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to a net cash outflow of $74.1 million a year earlier. Cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $216.7 million compared to a net inflow of $99.6 million in 1999.              In the event of short-term liquidity needs, The PrivateBank (Chicago) and The PrivateBank (St. Louis) may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks.  Impact of Inflation              Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry. Under these principles and practices, we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.              Unlike many industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation.  ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK              As a continuing part of our financial strategy, we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income. This effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield. Asset/liability management policy is established by our board of directors and is monitored by management. Our asset/liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate. These standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations, liquidity, loan limits as a percentage of funding sources, exposure to correspondent banks and brokers, and reliance on non-core deposits. The policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors. The investment policy complements the asset/liability policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities. These criteria include approved types of securities, brokerage sources, terms of investment, quality standards, and diversification.              We measure the impact of interest rate changes on our income statement through the use of gap analysis. The gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods. During any given time period, if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets, a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time. Conversely, a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates.                                          39               We have structured the assets and liabilities of our company to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment. We manage our gap position at the one year horizon. Depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short- and long-term, we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset/liability policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk. Our policy states that we shall maintain a gap position at the one year horizon of between 0.70 and 1.30. Our position at December 31, 2000 was 1.11 and was within the guidelines of our policy. We have continued to maintain our gap position near the low end set by our policy guidelines and expect to continue to operate in this manner as long as the general rate structure of the economy and our business opportunities remain consistent. Therefore, generally speaking, a short-term rise in interest rates will hurt our earnings, while a short-term drop in interest rates would help our earnings.              Interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. There are other factors which are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement. For example, a rapid drop in interest rates might cause our loans to repay at a more rapid pace and certain mortgage-related investments to prepay more quickly than projected. This could mitigate some of the benefits of falling rates that are expected when negatively gapped. Conversely, a rapid rise in rates could give us an opportunity to increase our margins and stifle the rate of repayment on our mortgage-related loans which would increase our returns.                                           40               The following tables illustrate the estimated interest rate sensitivity and periodic and cumulative gap positions calculated as of December 31, 2000 and 1999.

(9.6)%          9.3%         (8.3)%        10.8%               This table shows that if there was an instantaneous, parallel shift in the yield curve of +200 basis points, we would suffer a decline in net interest income of 9.6% and 8.3% over a two-year horizon based on our earning asset portfolio as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Conversely, a like shift of -200 basis points would increase net interest income by 9.3% over a two-year horizon based on December 31, 2000 balances, down slightly from the 10.8% measured on the basis of the December 31, 1999 portfolio.              Changes in the effect on net interest income from a 200 basis point movement at December 31, 2000 as compared to December 31, 1999 are relatively similar because of the timing of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities. In each period, the increase in interest income in the reduced rate environment and the decrease in interest income in an increased rate environment is due to our negatively gapped balance sheet within a two-year horizon.              In a rates down 200 basis points scenario, rate sensitive liabilities would reprice to reduced rates more quickly than many rate sensitive assets, resulting in higher net interest income. The percentage increase in a rates down scenario is less at December 31, 2000 than at December 31, 1999 because the percentage of our assets that would prepay in rates down has increased between years. In addition, we increased our term borrowings and brokered deposits during 2000. These additional sources of funding mature or reprice within one month to five years. The rate shock simulation over a two-year horizon does not reflect the issuance of $20.0 million of trust preferred securities which we completed on February 8, 2001 at a fixed rate of 9.50%. In a rates down scenario, the fixed rate trust preferred securities will negatively impact net interest income as these securities are fixed rate in nature.              The increased loss in a rates up 200 basis points environment at December 31, 2000 compared to December 31, 1999 is due to the addition of fixed rate assets and liabilities from the Johnson Bank acquisition. These fixed rate liabilities reprice faster than the assets, increasing the compression on our margin.              The preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve, prepayments on loans and securities, changes in deposit levels, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others. While our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change.              We continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates. We have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets, sell investment securities, or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk.                                          42   ITEM 8.
