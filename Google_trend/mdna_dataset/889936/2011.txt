ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> INTRODUCTION    The following discussion and analysis is intended to address the significant factors affecting our Consolidated Statements of Income for the years 2008 through 2010 and Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2009 and 2010. When we use the terms PrivateBancorp, the Company, we, us, and our, we mean PrivateBancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term the Bank, we are referring to our wholly owned banking subsidiary, The PrivateBank  Chicago brand. The following discussion is designed to provide stockholders with a comprehensive review of our operating results and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes thereto, and other financial information presented in this Form 10-K.    Unless otherwise stated, all earnings per share data included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis.    OVERVIEW   Net income for 2010 was $1.8 million, up from a net loss of $29.8 million for 2009. We reported a net loss available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $12.1 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, an improvement from a net loss of $42.5 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, in the prior year.   For 2010, we reported net revenue growth of 24% and a 30% increase in operating profit from the prior year. Overall performance was driven by margin expansion, growth in core fee-based products, and a favorable shift in the deposit mix, which reduced the cost of funds.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Net interest income for 2010 increased 23% from 2009. Compared to 2009, net interest income reflects the impact of downward deposit repricing and growth in earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.38% for 2010, up from 3.06% in 2009. Net interest margin continued to benefit from deposit repricing. With the continued low rate environment, further opportunities to materially reduce cost of funds will likely be limited in 2011.   For the year ended December 31, 2010, non-interest income increased to $93.2 million, up from $71.5 million for 2009. Non-interest income growth reflects continued success in expanding client relationships. Treasury management income, up 67% from 2009, continues to be a strong area of non-interest income growth. Wealth management income also increased 17% over the prior year. New loan originations drove growth in unused commitment, loan, and letter of credit fees. Mortgage banking income rose 14% from 2009, consistent with the broader industry trend of increased refinancing activity based on the low interest rate environment that prevailed over the past year. Exclusive of CVA adjustments, capital markets income decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting the reduced client demand for interest-rate derivatives. Net securities gains of $12.2 million and $7.4 million were included within non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.    Total expenses were impacted by higher workout-related credit costs and increased compensation expense. Non-interest expense for 2010 was $299.6 million, compared to $247.4 million for 2009. Credit-related expenses, which include net foreclosed property expense, loan and collection expense, and the provision for unfunded commitments, increased $20.6 million from 2009, primarily related to higher net foreclosed property expense due to an increase in other real estate owned (OREO) volume. Compensation expense was up $26.2 million from the prior year, impacted by increases in commission-based compensation and annual incentive compensation.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Efforts to reshape our loan portfolio consistent with our commercial middle-market strategy resulted in commercial loans representing 54% of our total portfolio at December 31, 2010, diversified across industries, compared to 48% at December 31, 2009. As a percentage of total loans, commercial real estate and construction loans were 6% lower at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. Total loans were relatively flat year over year as the decrease in commercial real estate and construction loans during 2010 was offset by growth in commercial loans.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">While some of our credit quality trends showed signs of stabilizing in 2010, our credit quality continued to be impacted by the weak commercial real estate sector. Nonperforming assets were $454.6 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of 4% from December 31, 2009, due to an increase in OREO as accounts moved through the credit management process. Nonaccrual loans trended modestly lower in 2010, decreasing $29.6 million from the prior year. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 3.65% at December 31, 2010, compared to 3.63% at December 31, 2009. As we continue to work through the credit cycle, nonperforming asset levels may fluctuate due to the uneven timing over which these issues may emerge and the timing of dispositions or other remediation efforts. We continue to pursue opportunities for loan and OREO sale transactions to resolve problem assets when appropriate. Despite ongoing workout        32            efforts, our ability to meaningfully reduce nonperforming assets primarily depends on the broader economys recovery and stabilization of the commercial real estate market.   For 2010, the provision for loan loss, excluding covered loan provision, was $192.0 million, down from $198.9 million in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 2.44% at December 31, 2010, compared to 2.45% at December 31, 2009. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 61% at December 31, 2010, compared to 56% at December 31, 2009. Net charge-offs were $190.9 million for 2010, compared to $89.9 million in the prior year.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We continue to maintain strong levels of liquidity in line with industry levels and driven by strong deposit flows. Total deposits were $10.5 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2009. Client deposits were $9.9 billion, or 94% of total deposits, at year-end 2010, compared to $9.3 billion at the prior year-end. Brokered deposits, excluding $852.5 million and $979.7 million in client CDARS STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1"> ®  deposits at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, remained unchanged at 6% of total deposits.   For financial information regarding our business segments, which include Banking, Wealth Management, and Holding Company Activities, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Operating Segments Results and Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income, provision for loan and covered loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset/liability management strategy. The provision for loan and covered loan losses is primarily affected by changes in the loan portfolios composition and performance, the identification of nonperforming loans, managements assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio, loss experience, as well as economic and market factors. Non-interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from wealth management, capital markets product income, treasury management income, mortgage banking income, bank owned life insurance and fees for ancillary banking services. Net securities gains/losses, if any, are also included in non-interest income.   Net Interest Income    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Net interest income is the primary source of our revenue. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest-earning and other assets or activities. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities, repricing frequencies, and the use of interest rate swaps and caps.    Interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. The net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because non-interest bearing sources of funds, principally non-interest bearing demand deposits and equity, also support earning assets.    The accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets are presented in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our accounting and reporting policies conform to U.S. GAAP and general practice within the financial services industry. For purposes of this discussion, net interest income and any ratios or metrics that include net interest income as a component, such as interest rate spread and net interest margin, have been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax-exempt securities to those on taxable interest-earning assets. Although we believe that these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of our business and performance, these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to U.S. GAAP. The reconciliation of tax-equivalent net interest income is presented in the following table.         33           Table 1    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Effect of Tax-Equivalent Adjustment    (Amounts in thousands)            0000000000     0000000000     0000000000     0000000000     0000000000          Years Ended December 31,        % Change            2010        2009        2008        2010-2009        2009-2008               Net interest income (U.S. GAAP)     $  400,957         $  324,984         $  190,395            23.4            70.7         Tax-equivalent adjustment        3,577            3,612            3,857            -1.0            -6.4                                                                  Tax-equivalent net interest income     $  404,534         $  328,596         $  194,252            23.1            69.2                                                                     Table 2 provides average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the associated interest income and expense, and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid, as well as net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the three years ended December 31, 2010. The table also presents the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for 2010 and 2009, including the tax-equivalent yields on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Table 3 below details variances in income and expense for each of the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and analyzes the extent to which such variances are attributable to volume and rate changes. Interest income and yields are presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%, which includes the tax-equivalent adjustment as presented in Table 1 above.   2010 Compared to 2009   Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $404.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $328.6 million for 2009, an increase of 23%. Net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for 2010 was 3.38%, an increase of 32 basis points from 3.06% in 2009. A higher volume of interest-earning assets positively impacted interest income by $43.0 million, while a decline in the average rate earned on covered assets and securities had a negative impact of $13.8 million. Despite an increase of $177.0 million on average nonaccrual loans from 2009 to 2010, the yield on loans, excluding covered assets, improved 6 basis points from 2009. The increase in loan yields reflects a change in loan mix more heavily weighted to higher-yielding commercial loans than lower-yielding commercial real estate loans. Lower short-term interest rates and deposit repricing initiatives decreased interest expense by $36.3 million, offset in part by higher interest rates paid on borrowings. While total average interest-bearing liabilities increased during 2010, a favorable shift in the mix lowered the amount of higher cost funding and led to a $17.8 million reduction in interest expense due to volume. Increases in net interest margin and interest income for 2010 include the benefit of a full year of higher interest earning assets from the mid-2009 FDIC-assisted acquisition, primarily in the form of covered assets. Covered asset accretion positively impacted net interest margin by 15 and 13 basis points for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   Net interest margin has been impacted by high liquidity on the balance sheet primarily held in low-yielding cash deposits at the Federal Reserve. We anticipate net interest margin is likely to continue to be impacted by the higher liquidity levels. In addition, we do not anticipate meaningful continued benefit of the downward repricing of deposits to net interest margin. We may see pressure on our net interest margin over the coming year if the rate environment remains low.    2009 Compared to 2008   Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $328.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $194.3 million for 2008, an increase of 69%. Net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for 2009 was 3.06%, an increase of 33 basis points from 2.73% for 2008. The increase in net interest margin was due to a 165 basis point decrease in the cost of funds, which was partially offset by a 126 basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets year-over-year. During 2009, we re-priced our interest-bearing liabilities such that the level of reductions outpaced those on our interest-earning assets. Net interest margin and interest income for 2009 included the benefit of higher interest earning assets from the mid-2009 FDIC-assisted acquisition, primarily in the form of covered assets. However, interest-earning assets were negatively impacted by the increase in nonperforming assets during the year, which grew to $436.9 million at December 31, 2009 from $155.7 million at December 31, 2008.         34           Table 2    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Net Interest Income and Margin Analysis    (Dollars in thousands)

Refer to the section entitled Covered Assets for a detail discussion.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Provision for loan losses    The provision for loan losses, excluding the provision for covered loan losses, totaled $192.0 million in 2010, compared to $198.9 million in 2009 and $189.6 million in 2008. The provision for loan losses is a function of our allowance for loan loss methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for inherent loan losses after net charge-offs have been deducted. Net charge-offs were $190.9 million in 2010, compared to $89.9 million in 2009 and $125.8 million in 2008. For further analysis and information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses and analysis of credit quality, see Critical Accounting Policies and Credit Quality Management and Allowance for Loan Losses.   Provision for covered loan losses    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $2.5 million in provision for covered loan losses related to the loans purchased under the FDIC-assisted transaction loss share agreement, reflecting a decline in expected cash flows subsequent to the date of acquisition on such loans. The provision for covered loan losses represents the change in the value of the 20% non-reimbursable        37            portion of expected losses.

These policies cover the lives of certain Company officers, when originated, for which the Company is the beneficiary. The change in CSV is attributable to earnings or losses credited to the policies, based on investments made by the insurer. The cash surrender value of BOLI was $49.4 million at December 31, 2010, $47.7 million at December 31, 2009, and $45.9 million at December 31, 2008. For a further discussion of our investment in BOLI, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    2010 Compared to 2009   Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $93.2 million, an increase of $21.8 million, or 30%, from $71.5 million in 2009, reflecting continued success in penetrating and cross-selling targeted middle-market commercial relationships. Our total fee revenue for 2010 was $81.1 million, an increase of $16.0 million, or 25%, from $65.1 million in 2009.    We continue to actively market our treasury management capabilities incorporating a full range of receivables and payables services in addition to online banking and reporting. These products and services include remote capture, liquidity management, and lockbox services, which augment non-interest and interest-bearing deposits. Treasury management income increased $6.8 million, or 67%, from 2009. This increase is attributable to improved capabilities in offering a broader suite of products and services to new and existing clients and increasing penetration in our clients transaction-based activities.    Wealth management income increased $2.7 million, or 17%, from 2009 and was attributable to increases in the assets under management and administration (AUMA), in part due to improved equity and fixed income market performance. Wealth management fee revenue is predominately based on the market value of AUMA. AUMA are assets held in trust where we serve as trustee or in accounts where we make investment decisions on behalf of clients. AUMA also includes non-managed assets we hold in custody for clients or for which we receive fees for advisory or brokerage services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Statements of Condition. Total AUMA increased by $288.0 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2009 to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2010.   Mortgage banking income increased $1.3 million, or 14%, from 2009, reflecting the broader industry trend of increased refinancing based on the low interest rate environment that prevailed over the past year.    Capital markets income decreased $2.9 million, or 17%, from 2009. Of the $2.9 million decrease, $2.4 million represents changes in the credit valuation adjustment (CVA), with an $838,000 positive CVA in 2009 and a negative $1.6 million CVA in 2010. The        38            CVA represents the credit component of fair value with regard to both client-based trades and the related matched trades with interbank dealer counterparties. Exclusive of CVA adjustments, capital markets income decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting the reduced client demand for interest-rate derivatives, offset by a $1.9 million increase in foreign exchange revenues, resulting from our implementation of enhanced client interface tools to improve our foreign exchange product offering.    Other income, service charges, and fees increased $8.1 million, or 70%, from 2009. The increase was primarily due to a $3.6 million decrease in losses on loans held for sale from the prior year, which totaled $564,000 in 2010 and $4.2 million in 2009. Also, new commercial loan originations and increased cross-sell penetration drove $2.9 million of growth in unused commitment, loan, and letter of credit fees from the prior year.    Net securities gains increased $4.8 million, or 65%, from 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we took advantage of market conditions to sell $432.9 million of securities, resulting in a net gain of $12.2 million. In contrast, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold $265.8 million of securities, resulting in a net gain of $7.4 million.    2009 Compared to 2008   Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $71.5 million, an increase of 73% from $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Non-interest income increased during 2009 due to the contribution of our expanded products and services offered through the treasury management group, new product offerings that contributed to increased banking and other services income, increased revenue from capital markets products, and a significant increase in mortgage banking income.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Treasury management income increased $7.8 million from 2008 to 2009, which was attributable to growth in delivery of services to new and existing clients and increased penetration in our clients transaction-based activities.    Capital markets income was $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a 55% increase from $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The 2009 income included an $838,000 favorable movement in CVA. Also, low short-term interest rates accelerated the yield protection trend of embedding floors in loans, resulting in fewer derivatives cross sell opportunities.    Mortgage banking income was $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase from $4.2 million in 2008, due to the low interest rate environment, which stimulated market demand for refinancing and a higher volume of loans sold.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Wealth managements fee revenue was $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Wealth managements AUMA were $4.0 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase from $3.3 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease in revenue year-over-year is due to lower asset values during the first half of 2009, a higher allocation of assets to non-fee producing cash equivalents, and an increase in lower-fee producing client relationships during 2009 compared to 2008.    Other income, service charges, and fees increased $7.2 million from 2008 to 2009. The increase was primarily due to fees related to increased product offerings such as syndication fees and increases in unused commitment and letters of credit fees.   Non-interest income in 2009 included net investment securities gains of $7.4 million compared to $510,000 in the prior year. The increase in securities gains was primarily due to sales of U.S. Treasury securities made during 2009.

The efficiency ratio is presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. See Table 28, Non-U.S. GAAP Measures, for a reconciliation of the effect of the tax-equivalent adjustment.   2010 Compared to 2009   Non-interest expense increased $52.2 million, or 21%, from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense, an increase in net foreclosed property and loan and collection expenses related to credit deterioration, and a higher provision for unfunded commitments.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Compensation expense increased $26.2 million, or 21%, from 2009 and is largely attributable to higher annual incentive compensation, a higher level of average full-time equivalents (FTE) as a result of the FDIC-assisted transaction in mid-2009, and increases in commission-based compensation. Incentive compensation expense was higher in 2010, as the prior year did not include any significant level of bonus expense due to the loss from continuing operations reported in 2009.    Net foreclosed property expense, which includes write-downs on foreclosed properties, gains and losses on sales of foreclosed properties, and other expenses associated with the foreclosure process and maintenance of OREO, increased $9.5 million from 2009. The increase in net foreclosed property expense is primarily due to maintenance and administration associated with a higher volume of OREO properties, coupled with higher valuation write-downs in 2010 as compared to the prior year.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Loan and collection expense increased $5.0 million, or 52%, from 2009 due to a higher volume of appraisals and legal costs incurred in connection with credit remediation efforts on our nonperforming loans. We anticipate loan and collection costs to remain at an elevated level until nonperforming loans decline meaningfully.         40           Other expenses increased $8.5 million, or 59%, from the prior year period. Other expenses include various categories such as bank charges, costs associated with the CDARS ®  product offering, education-related costs, subscriptions, and miscellaneous losses and expenses. The increase was primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in the provision for unfunded commitments and $3.5 million in higher costs associated with the use of third-party service providers as volumes increased due to the expanded client base.    Insurance expense increased $3.9 million, or 17%, from 2009. Excluding the $5.1 million FDIC special assessment in 2009, deposit insurance premiums increased 51% in 2010 due to the combined effect of a higher deposit base upon which fees are assessed, higher fee rates, and the additional 10 basis point assessment paid on covered transaction accounts exceeding $250,000 under the Transaction Account Guarantee Program component of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TAGP), which we elected to participate in through December 31, 2010. In February 2011, the FDIC adopted final rules relating to deposit insurance premiums. Although our current expectation is that the new rules will not have a significant impact on our assessments, there can be no assurance that the adoption of the new rules will not result in increased assessments. The rules take effect April 1, 2011, and will impact assessments beginning in the second quarter of 2011.   Net occupancy expense increased $3.8 million, or 14%, from 2009. The increase in net occupancy expense from the prior year reflects $920,000 in additional facility rental expense, $1.4 million in increased depreciation expense, and $802,000 in increased maintenance contract expense related to additional offices acquired in the FDIC-assisted transaction, as well as our increased office space.    Professional services, which includes fees paid for legal, accounting, and consulting services, decreased $3.4 million, or 21%, from 2009. The decrease from the prior year period relates in part to non-recurring expenses incurred one year ago in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction and subsequent integration activities.   2009 Compared to 2008   Non-interest expense increased $51.3 million, or 26%, from 2008 to 2009. The increase represented continued investment in our strategic development during 2009 and a combined increase in salaries, net occupancy expense, technology costs, loan and collection expenses, and insurance costs. The increase over the prior year was also due to the transaction integration costs attributable to the FDIC-assisted transaction in mid-2009.    Compensation expense increased $123.7 million, or 6%, during 2009, due to the 35% increase in FTEs from 2008 to 2009. The increase in FTEs was primarily associated with the addition of more than 200 employees from the FDIC-assisted transaction in mid 2009. The 2009 increase was partially offset by a $13.4 million net reduction in compensation paid under our annual cash incentive plan compared to full year 2008. Due to the net loss in 2009, the plan did not provide for incentive compensation payment to employees other than to associate managing directors, certain officers and staff.    The 53% increase in occupancy expense during 2009 to $26.2 million, compared to $17.1 million in 2008, reflected the investments we made in growing our office space to accommodate our larger downtown Chicago team along with ten additional offices acquired as a result of the FDIC-assisted transaction.   Technology and related costs increased 68% to $10.6 million in 2009, compared to $6.3 million in 2008. Technology and related costs increased during 2009 due to increased operational costs and investment in technology to support our expanded products and services as a result of our growth and the FDIC-assisted transaction integration costs.   Professional fees increased 17% to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $14.0 million for 2008. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the execution of the FDIC-assisted transaction and subsequent integration activities.   Insurance expense increased by $15.2 million to $22.6 million in 2009, compared to $7.4 million in 2008. The increase in insurance expense was primarily due to increased FDIC insurance premiums caused by increased rates, special assessments totaling $5.1 million in the second quarter 2009, and a 24% increase in deposit balances during 2009.   Loan and collection expense increased 218% to $9.6 million at December 31, 2009 from $3.0 million at December 31, 2008. The $6.6 million increase was due to costs associated with nonperforming loan review, monitoring, and workout activity.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Other expenses increased 114% to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $6.7 million for the prior year. The $7.6 million increase was largely attributable to higher CDARS STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1"> ®  fee expense correlated to the growth in this deposit category from the prior year, increased fees paid to third-party service providers used on a recurring basis, and restructuring charges incurred during 2009.    Income Taxes        41           Our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense. An analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods 2008 through 2010 are presented in the following table.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Table 6    Income Tax Provision Analysis   (Dollars in thousands)             0000000000     0000000000     0000000000           Years ended December 31,             2010        2009        2008        Income (loss) before income tax provision      $  64         $  (50,380  )      $  (153,993  )      Income tax expense (benefit)      $  (1,737  )      $  (20,564  )      $  (61,357  )      Effective income tax (benefit) rate         n/m            -40.8%            -39.8%       The effective income tax rate varies from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% (federal income tax benefit rate of -35% for pre-tax loss periods) principally due to state income taxes, the effects of earnings from tax-exempt securities and bank-owned life insurance, non-deductible compensation and business expenses, tax credits and in 2010, tax audit settlements. The effective tax rate in 2010 is not meaningful because the small amount of pre-tax income causes the permanent differences described above to disproportionately impact the effective tax rate compared to what would normally be expected.    The effective tax benefit rate was marginally greater in 2009 than in 2008 primarily because of the higher proportion of tax-exempt income, relative to the loss before income taxes. This was mitigated somewhat in 2009 by a proportionally higher amount of non-deductible compensation.    Realization of Deferred Tax Assets   Net deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.   As a result of the pre-tax losses incurred during 2008 and 2009, we are in a cumulative pre-tax loss position for financial statement purposes for the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. This represents significant negative evidence in the assessment of whether the deferred tax assets will be realized. However, we have concluded that based on the weight provided by other positive evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.    Deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 represent the aggregate of federal and state tax assets, although federal taxes represent the primary component of the balance. Taxable income in prior years and reversing deferred taxable income amounts provide sources from which deferred tax assets may be absorbed. Most significantly, however, we have relied on our ability to generate future federal taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences, as the primary source from which deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 will be absorbed.    In making the determination that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized, we considered negative evidence associated with the cumulative book loss position, our past performance in forecasting credit costs, as well as continued challenging conditions in the commercial real estate sector.   We have considered the positive evidence associated with (a) taxable income generated in 2009 and 2010; (b) reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods; (c) the decline in the cumulative book loss during 2010 and our expectations regarding 2011; (d) our success in achieving increasing levels of pre-tax, pre-loan loss provision earnings during 2009 and 2010, a core source for future taxable income; (e) our reporting of pre-tax profits in each of the past three quarters and five of the past eight quarters; (f) the concentration of credit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio during the past three years and the relative stability of credit trends in recent quarters; (g) our excess capital position relative to well capitalized regulatory standards and other industry benchmarks; and (h) no history of Federal net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of the 20-year Federal net operating loss carryforward period.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, we also considered both positive and negative evidence associated with the estimated timing of reversals of deferred deductible and deferred taxable items and the level of such net reversal amounts relative to taxable income run rate assumptions in future periods.    Certain of the factors noted above support our expectation of generating future pre-tax book earnings in future periods. We believe this in turn should give rise to taxable income levels (exclusive of reversing temporary differences) that more likely than not would be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets.         42           At December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately $13 million of deferred tax assets that relate to equity compensation awards that may not be fully realized, primarily due to a decline in the Companys stock price since the awards were granted. In such circumstances a valuation allowance is not recorded but when such awards vest, are exercised or expire, the Company incurs tax charges because of the stock price shortfall. During 2010 and 2009 such shortfall amounts totaled $3.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance for share-based compensation, were charged to stockholders equity because there was a sufficient level of excess tax benefits accumulated from prior years. The Company expects that the balance of prior year excess tax benefits may be reduced to $0 in the future due to additional shortfall charges, in which case any future charges may need to be recorded to income tax expense, resulting in an increase in the Companys effective tax rate. The amount of such shortfall charges in future periods, the amount that may be charged to income tax expense and the timing of such charges cannot be reasonably estimated because it is largely dependent on changes in the Companys stock price and other factors.    Operating Segments Results   We have three primary business segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Holding Company Activities. The PrivateBank Mortgage Company results are included in the Banking segment.    Banking   The profitability of our Banking segment is primarily dependent on net interest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Net income for the Banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $31.7 million, a $27.5 million increase from net income of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net income for the Banking segment resulted primarily from a 21% increase in net interest income and a 34% increase in non-interest income, offset by a 27% increase in non-interest expense. Net income for the Banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $4.2 million, compared to a net loss of $57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net interest income for the Banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased to $420.6 million from $347.1 million in 2009 and $214.3 million in 2008. Total loans for the Banking segment increased slightly to $9.1 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2009. Commercial loans, including commercial and industrial and certain owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, continued to be the fastest-growing segment of the loan portfolio and increased to $4.9 billion, or 54% of our total loans, from $4.3 billion, or 48% of total loans at December 31, 2009. Commercial real estate loans were 31% of our total loans at December 31, 2010, compared to 34% of total loans at December 31, 2009. Total deposits increased by 6% to $10.7 billion at December 31, 2010 from $10.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Growth in non-interest bearing demand deposits and money market deposits accounted for the majority of the deposit growth.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Wealth Management    The Wealth Management segment includes investment management, investment advisory, personal trust and estate administration, custodial and escrow, retirement account administration, and brokerage services. Lodestar Investment Counsel, LLC, an investment management firm and partially-owned subsidiary, is included in our Wealth Management segment. We own a controlling interest in Lodestar and management of Lodestar owns the remaining interest.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Net income attributable to controlling interests for Wealth Management increased 19% to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $1.7 million for 2009, and up from $1.4 million for the same period in 2008. The increase in net income from 2009 to 2010 is attributable to a 17% increase in fee revenue, offset by a 12% increase in non-interest expense. Wealth Management AUMA grew to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2010 as compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2009. Wealth Managements fee revenue increased to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in fee revenue was attributable to larger AUMA over the course of 2010 than the prior years.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We engage third-party investment managers, as well as Lodestar Investment Counsel, LLC, for a number of our wealth management relationships. Fees paid to third-party investment managers increased to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $3.3 million for the same period in 2008. The decrease from 2008 to 2009 was generally attributable to a decline in total assets managed by third-party investment managers, with an increase in assets managed in mutual funds and exchange traded funds, as well as an increase in the portion of funds that are managed by fixed income managers rather than equity managers.   Holding Company Activities    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Holding Company Activities segment consists of parent company only matters and intersegment eliminations. The Holding Companys most significant assets are its net investments in its bank subsidiary and its mortgage subsidiary. Undistributed earnings         43            relating to these investments are not included in the Holding Company financial results. Holding Company financial results are represented primarily by interest expense on borrowings and operating expenses. Recurring operating expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation and professional fees. The Holding Company Activities segment reported a net loss of $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to a net loss of $35.9 million for the same period in 2009 and a net loss of $37.1 million for 2008.    Additional information about our operating segments are also discussed in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> FINANCIAL CONDITION    INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT   We manage our investment portfolio with a goal of maximizing the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines, to meet pledging and liquidity requirements, and to adjust balance sheet interest rate sensitivity to attempt to protect net interest income against the impact of changes in interest rates. We may adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio according to a number of factors, including expected liquidity needs, the current and forecasted interest rate environment, our actual and anticipated balance sheet growth rate, the relative value of various segments of the securities markets, and the broader economic environment.    Investments are comprised of debt securities and to a small degree, non-marketable equity investments. Our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of residential mortgage-backed pools, collateralized mortgage obligations, U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, and state and municipal securities.   All debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and may be sold as part of our asset/liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on the securities available-for-sale represent the difference between the aggregated cost and fair value of the portfolio and are reported, on an after-tax basis, as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. This balance sheet component will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change, thereby affecting the aggregate fair value of the portfolio.    Non-marketable equity investments include FHLB stock and other various equity securities. At December 31, 2010, our investment in FHLB stock was $20.7 million, compared to $22.8 million at December 31, 2009. Our FHLB stock holdings are necessary to maintain the FHLB advances. Also included in non-marketable equity investments are certain investments in funds that make investments in accordance with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Such investments had a carrying amount of $2.8 million at December 31, 2010. During 2010, we recognized net losses of $912,000 on our CRA-related investments.    We do not own any Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae preferred stock or subordinated debt obligations, bank trust preferred securities, nor do we own any sub-prime mortgage-backed securities.

The $312.2 million increase is attributable to client deposit growth which was reinvested in available-for-sale securities purchases of collateralized mortgage obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities and was a part of our asset/liability management strategy.   Due to changing market conditions during 2010, we repositioned a portion of our investment portfolio, selling a total of $432.7 million of available-for-sale securities, comprised of $241.4 million of residential mortgage-backed securities, $145.3 million of collateralized mortgage obligations, $36.0 million of state and municipal securities, and $10.0 million of U.S. Treasury securities. These sale transactions resulted in a net securities gain of $13.1 million, compared to $265.8 million of securities sales in 2009 for a net gain of $7.4 million.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Investments in collateralized mortgage obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities comprise 90% of the available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2010. All of the mortgage securities are backed by U.S. Government-owned agencies or issued by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises. All mortgage securities are composed of fixed-rate, fully-amortizing collateral with final maturities of 30 years or less.   Investments in debt instruments of state and local municipalities comprised 9% of the total available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2010. This type of security has historically experienced very low default rates and provides a predictable cash flow since it generally is not subject to significant prepayment. Insurance companies regularly provide credit enhancement to improve the credit rating and liquidity of a municipal bond issuance. Management considers the credit enhancement and underlying municipality credit rating when evaluating a purchase or sale decision.   At December 31, 2010, our reported equity reflected net unrealized securities gains, net of tax of $20.1 million. This represented a decrease of $7.8 million from net unrealized securities gains, net of tax of $27.9 million at December 31, 2009. The average yield on our securities portfolio decreased to 4.10% at December 31, 2010 from 4.76% at December 31, 2009.   The following table presents the maturities of the different types of investments that we own at December 31, 2010, and the corresponding interest rates that the investments will yield if they are held to their respective maturity date.

Actual re-pricings and yields of the securities may differ from those reflected in the table depending upon actual interest rates and prepayment speeds.        (2)    Yields on state and municipal securities are reflected on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. The maturity date of state and municipal bonds is based on contractual maturity, unless the bond, based on current market prices, is deemed to have a high probability that the call will be exercised, in which case the call date is used as the maturity date.       (3)    The re-pricing distribution of FHLB stock is based on dividend announcements. The re-pricing distributions of other equity securities are based on each investments re-pricing characteristics.    LOAN PORTFOLIO AND CREDIT QUALITY (excluding covered assets)   Our principal source of revenue arises from our lending activities, primarily composed of interest income and, to a lesser extent, loan origination and commitment fees (net of related costs). The accounting policies underlying the recording of loans in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and the recognition and/or deferral of interest income and fees (net of costs) arising from lending activities are included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The following discussion of our loan portfolio and credit quality excludes covered assets. Covered assets represent assets acquired through an FDIC-assisted transaction that are subject to a loss share agreement and are presented separately on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. For additional discussion of covered assets, see Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the Covered Asset section presented later in Managements Discussion and Analysis.    Portfolio Composition   Outstanding loans, excluding covered assets, increased to $9.1 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2009, with new loans and advances on existing facilities offset by paydowns and payoffs of existing loans and charge-offs. Loan growth during 2010 was relatively flat compared to the 13% loan growth we experienced in 2009, as a result of modest overall borrowing demand during 2010 and low line utilization rates resulting from higher levels of liquidity maintained by our commercial clients relative to historic periods. Loan growth was also impacted as we selectively focused on executing strategic opportunities within our existing capital base.    During 2010, we continued to reshape the composition of our loan portfolio as part of our commercial middle-market strategy. Commercial loans increased by $596.9 million, or 14%, to 54% of total loans at December 31, 2010, compared to 48% at December 31, 2009. Commercial real estate and construction loans decreased by $480.6 million in aggregate to 37% of total loans at December 31, 2010, compared to 43% at December 31, 2009 as we exited relationships and worked out problem loans concentrated in the commercial real estate category.         46           Commercial loans increased 14% to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2010 from $4.3 billion at December 31, 2009. The growth in commercial loans accounted for all the net loan growth within our loan portfolio during the year consistent with our commercial middle-market strategy.   Commercial real estate loans decreased 8% to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2010 from $3.1 billion at December 31, 2009. The reduction in commercial real estate loans resulted from paydowns and payoffs of existing loans, charge-offs, offset by the migration of loans previously reported in the construction category, as these loans progressed past the construction phase as certificates of occupancy were issued.    Construction loans decreased 31% to $530.7 million at December 31, 2010 from $768.4 million at December 31, 2009. Residential construction decreased 50% to $30.7 million at December 31, 2010 as a result of lower residential construction volume and our continued efforts to reduce our residential development portfolio. Non-residential construction loans decreased 29% to $500.0 million at December 31, 2010 due to the current construction downturn and the lifecycle migration of loans secured by construction projects to commercial real estate loans.   Residential real estate loans made to individuals totaled $319.1 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $319.5 million at December 31, 2009. Home equity loans totaled $197.2 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $220.0 million at December 31, 2009. As a percentage of our total loan portfolio, home equity loans remain unchanged at 2% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Personal loans totaled $296.3 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $321.6 million at December 31, 2009.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">At December 31, 2010, Shared National Credits (SNCs) represented approximately 12% of total loans, compared with 14% of total loans at December 31, 2009. SNCs are defined as loan commitments of at least $20.0 million that are shared by three or more regulated financial institutions. We act in an agent capacity in some of these transactions and in a participant capacity in others.   During 2009, total loans increased $1.0 billion, or 13%, from December 31, 2008 primarily due to growth in commercial loans of $722.7 million, or 20%, reflecting the new middle-market client loans originated by lenders hired in connection with our 2007 strategic plan. The $346.3 million, or 13%, growth of commercial real estate loans during 2009 was spread across all major property types with geographic dispersion and reflected a larger average loan size for this category of credit.

Excluding mixed use/other, which represented 29% of our construction portfolio, no single collateral type exceeded 20% of our commercial real estate or construction loan portfolios at December 31, 2010. The single largest category of commercial real estate at December 31, 2010 was office real estate, which represented 18% of the portfolio. Our exposure to land loans, which is currently a very illiquid asset class, decreased from $489.7 million at December 31, 2009 to $357.5 million at December 31, 2010, or 11% of the combined commercial real estate and construction portfolios. This collateral type declined due to reduced lending against land, the movement of land loans into development stages, and charge-offs.         47           Table 10    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Commercial Real Estate and Construction Loan Portfolio    by Collateral Type    (Dollars in thousands)             0000000000     0000000000     0000000000     0000000000           December 31, 2010         December 31, 2009             Amount         % of Total         Amount         % of Total        Commercial Real Estate                                 Land      $  311,464             11          $  398,506             13         Residential 1-4 family         139,689             5             177,711             6         Multi-family         457,246             16             553,473             18         Industrial/warehouse         391,694             14             354,575             11         Office         531,193             18             490,940             16         Retail         450,135             16             494,139             16         Health care         114,545             4             63,285             2         Mixed use/other         462,203             16             568,537             18                                                                     Total commercial real estate      $  2,858,169             100          $  3,101,166             100                                                                     Construction                                 Land      $  46,036             9          $  91,207             12         Residential 1-4 family         30,698             6             61,854             8         Multi-family         77,685             15             131,001             17         Industrial/warehouse         34,703             7             36,455             5         Office         92,369             17             117,241             15         Retail         92,268             17             132,395             17         Mixed use/other         156,974             29             198,205             26                                                                     Total construction      $  530,733             100          $  768,358             100                                                             Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity of Loan Portfolio   The following table summarizes the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2010, by category, as well as the interest rate sensitivity of loans in these categories that have maturities in excess of one year.         48           Table 11    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans    to Changes in Interest Rates   (Dollars in thousands)             000000000000     000000000000     000000000000     000000000000           As of December 31, 2010             Due in 1 year STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">or less         Due after 1 year through 5 years         Due after 5 years         Total        Commercial      $  999,617          $  3,527,500          $  385,760          $  4,912,877         Commercial real estate         890,695             1,851,050             116,424             2,858,169         Construction         290,964             233,218             6,551             530,733         Residential real estate         12,256             44,217             262,673             319,146         Home equity         36,117             147,625             13,437             197,179         Personal         129,671             163,389             3,193             296,253                                                                     Total      $  2,359,320          $  5,966,999          $  788,038          $  9,114,357                                                               Loans maturing after one year:                                 Predetermined (fixed) interest rates             $  906,075          $  78,222                Floating interest rates                5,060,924             709,816                                                                Total             $  5,966,999          $  788,038                                                        Delinquent Loans, Nonperforming Assets and Potential Problem Loans   Loans are considered delinquent if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payment is due, generally 30 days or more past due. The majority of our loans is not fully amortizing over the term of the loan and may become delinquent at maturity if the borrower is unable to obtain refinancing when, for example, the appraised value of the underlying collateral no longer supports the credit. In recent quarters, the amount of in-flows to nonperforming loans has exceeded delinquent loan levels, reflecting, in part, the fact that loans which cannot be renewed or repaid at maturity often become nonperforming before 90 days past due. All loans greater than 90 days past due are nonperforming.    Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure proceedings and awaiting disposition (OREO). Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans, restructured loans that remain on nonaccrual, and, for periods prior to 2009, loans past due 90 days and accruing interest. We specifically exclude certain restructured loans that accrue interest from our definition of nonperforming loans if the borrower has demonstrated the ability to meet the new terms of the restructuring as evidenced by a minimum of six months of performance in compliance with the restructured terms or if the borrowers performance prior to the restructuring or other significant events at the time of the restructuring supports returning the loan to accruing status. All loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest payments become 90 days past due or earlier when management deems the collectability of the principal or interest to be in question rather than waiting until the loans become 90 days past due. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is only recorded on a cash basis after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal and/or interest. Foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs at time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses. On a periodic basis, the book values of these properties are adjusted based upon new appraisals and/or market indications. Write-downs are recorded for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties. Nonperforming assets, including nonaccrual loans, are presented in Tables 13, 13.1 and 14. Additional information on our OREO is presented in Tables 16 through 18.   As part of our ongoing risk management practices and in certain circumstances, we may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties. Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate, extension of the maturity date, reductions in the principal balance, or other actions intended to minimize potential losses that would otherwise not be considered or improve our ultimate recovery on the loan. Concessionary modifications are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings. Restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. We may utilize a multiple note structure as a workout alternative for certain loans. The multiple note typically structures a troubled loan into two notes, where the first note is reasonably        49            assured of repayment and performance according to the prudently modified terms and the portion of the troubled loan that is not reasonably assured of repayment is charged-off. Troubled debt restructurings accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms, otherwise the restructured loan will remain on nonaccrual. The composition of our restructured loans is presented in Tables 13.1 and 15.    Total nonperforming assets increased by $17.7 million from $436.9 million at December 31, 2009 to $454.6 million at December 31, 2010. During the year, total OREO increased $47.2 million, reflecting the movement of several larger accounts to OREO, while total nonperforming loans decreased by 7% during the year. Nonperforming assets were 3.65% of total assets at December 31, 2010, compared to 3.63% at December 31, 2009.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Nonperforming loans were $365.9 million at December 31, 2010, down from $395.4 million at December 31, 2009. As shown in Table 14 providing nonperforming loan stratification by size, 16 nonperforming loans in excess of $5 million comprised approximately 38% of our total nonperforming loans at December 31, 2010.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The level and composition of our nonperforming loans has changed over the past three years, reflecting the impact of economic weakness and significant stress in the commercial real estate market, which continues to represent the majority of our nonperforming loans by type. Nonperforming loan inflows result not only from delinquent payment trends but also from maturing loans for products in which exit financing at maturity is difficult (such as the current market for commercial real estate refinancing).    Commercial nonperforming loans increased by $12.8 million, or 18%, from December 31, 2009. A meaningful amount of the increase in commercial nonperforming loans was concentrated in two relationships. Commercial real estate nonperforming loans increased by $31.7 million, or 19%, from December 31, 2009, due to the continuing stress in this product sector and the lack of velocity in the market. Construction nonperforming loans decreased by $80.4 million, or 71%, from December 31, 2009 reflecting work-out efforts and charge-offs. Approximately 65% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2010 were commercial real estate and construction loans compared to 72% at December 31, 2009.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Restructured loans accruing interest were $87.6 million at December 31, 2010, compared to no restructured loans accruing interest at December 31, 2009. Of the modified loans added during the year, 57% were from three large credit relationships totaling $49.5 million where management identified restructuring opportunities. Restructured loans accruing interest are not considered to be nonperforming assets.   We executed a number of transactions to reduce problem assets during 2010. We closed nonperforming loan and OREO sales totaling $21.8 million and $85.8 million, respectively, during 2010. As we look to dispose of nonperforming assets, our efforts and strategies may be impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the pace and timing of the overall recovery of the economy, instability or lack of meaningful activity in the real estate market or higher levels of real estate coming into the market for sale.

We do not necessarily expect to realize losses on these potential problem loans, but we do recognize these loans carry a higher probability of default and require additional attention by management. Although these loans are generally identified as potential problem loans, they may never become nonperforming. Because many of the potential problem loans are commercial real estate-related, a highly stressed loan sector, and because the potential problem loan population contains some larger sized credits, our total nonperforming assets may fluctuate over the next several quarters as we continue to execute remediation plans and work through the credit cycle. Potential problem loans as of December 31, 2010 are included in Table 15.1.         54           The Company has adopted an internal risk rating policy in which each loan is rated for credit quality with a numerical rating of 1 through 8. Loans rated 5 and better (1-5 ratings, inclusive) are credits that exhibit acceptable financial performance, cash flow, and leverage. If any risk exists, we attempt to mitigate by structure, collateral, monitoring, or other meaningful controls. Credits rated 6 are considered special mention as these credits demonstrate potential weakness and that if left unresolved, may result in deterioration in the Companys credit position and/or the repayment prospects for the credit. Borrowers rated special mention may exhibit adverse operating trends, high leverage, tight liquidity or other credit concerns. Potential problem loans have a risk rating of 7 and are considered inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor, the collateral pledged, or guarantors. These loans generally have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that may jeopardize liquidation of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not resolved. Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans risk rated 7 or 8 and have all the weaknesses inherent in a 7 rated potential problem loan with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Special mention, potential problem and nonperforming loans are reviewed at minimum on a quarterly basis, while all other rated credits are reviewed as the situation warrants.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The following table presents the credit quality of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2010, segmented by our transformational and legacy portfolios. We aggregate loans by originating line of business for reserve purposes because of observable similarities in the performance experience of loans underwritten by the business units. Loans originated by the business units that existed prior to the strategic changes in 2007 are considered legacy loans. Loans originated by a business unit that was established in connection with or following the business transformation plan are considered transformational loans. Renewals or restructurings of legacy loans may continue to be evaluated as legacy loans depending on the structure or defining characteristics of the new transaction. The Company has implemented a line of business model that has reorganized the legacy business units so that after 2009, all new loan originations are considered transformational.

Foreclosed real estate         55           Foreclosed real estate (OREO) totaled $88.7 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $41.5 million at December 31, 2009, and is comprised of 379 properties. Given current economic conditions and the real estate market, the time required to sell these properties in an orderly fashion has extended, resulting in higher levels of OREO and associated maintenance costs in 2010. The increase in OREO properties during 2010 reflects the movement of defaulted loans through the credit management process. Table 16 presents changes in the OREO portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Table 17 presents a comparison of OREO properties by type at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Table 18 presents OREO property types by geographic location at December 31, 2010 and 2009.   At December 31, 2010, land parcels represented the largest portion of OREO at 38% of the total OREO carrying value and consisting of 320 properties. Single family homes represented 24% of the total OREO carrying value and consisted of 24 properties.

The allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time. The allowance is not a prediction of our actual credit losses going forward based on current and available information. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired (the specific component of the allowance), as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified (the general component of the allowance), which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio and managements judgment.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The specific component of the allowance relates to impaired loans. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans and loans classified as a troubled debt restructuring. All loans that are over 90 days past due in principal or interest are by definition considered impaired and placed on nonaccrual status. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on, as applicable, the fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent, the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the loans observable fair value. Impaired loans exceeding $500,000 are evaluated individually while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of asset and product type. If the estimated fair value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (including accrued interest, net of deferred loan fees and costs and unamortized premium or discount), impairment is recognized by creating a specific reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses. The recognition of any reserve required on new impaired loans is recorded in the same quarter in which the movement to nonaccrual occurred. Impaired loans with specific reserves are reviewed quarterly for any changes that would affect the specific reserve. Any impaired loan in which a determination has been made that the economic value is permanently reduced is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses to reflect its current economic value in the period in which the determination has been made.   When collateral-dependent real estate loans are determined to be impaired, updated appraisals are typically obtained every twelve months and evaluated internally every six months. In addition, both borrower and market-specific factors are taken into consideration, which may result in obtaining more frequent appraisal updates or broker-price opinions. Appraisals are typically conducted by third-party independent appraisers under internal direction and engagement. Any appraisal with a value in excess of $250,000 is internally reviewed. Appraisals received with a value in excess of $1.0 million may be sent to an outside technical review firm if appropriate.         57            Both levels of review involve a scope appropriate for the complexity and risk associated with the loan and its collateral. We consider other factors or recent developments which could adjust the valuations indicated in the appraisals or internal reviews. As of December 31, 2010, the average appraisal age used in the impaired loan valuation process was approximately 219 days. The amount of impaired assets which, by policy, requires an independent appraisal, but does not have a current external appraisal at year-end is not material to the overall reserve. In situations such as this, we establish a probable impairment reserve for the account based on our experience in the related asset class and type.    The general component of the allowance is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio. The methodology takes into account at a product level the originating line of business (i.e., the transformational or legacy status of the loan), the origination year, the risk rating migration of the note, and historical default and loss history of similar products. Using this information, the methodology produces a range of possible reserve amounts by product. We consider the appropriate place within or outside these model ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by the model that includes market and economic data and management judgment. We also assess the general allocated component estimate in total and consider whether, based on managements judgment, any upwards or downwards adjustment is appropriate based on general and industry specific economic data, credit trends, information outside the model and other relevant indicators. In our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance at December 31, 2010, we considered a number of factors for each product that included, but were not limited to, the following: for the commercial portfolio, the pace of growth in the commercial loan sector, the growth of manufacturing activity, loss severity and default trends; for the commercial real estate portfolio, the potential impact of general commercial real estate trends, occupancy and leasing rate trends, the higher frequency of default in more recent years, charge-off severity and collateral value deterioration; for the construction portfolio, the frequency of default, delinquency rates, industry experience on construction loan losses, construction spending rates, and employment rates in the construction industry; and for the residential, home equity, and personal portfolios, home price indices, sales volume, unemployment rates, vacancy rates, foreclosure rates, loan to value ratios, and delinquency rates.    The establishment of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment and includes a level of imprecision given the difficulty of identifying all the factors impacting loan repayment and the timing of when losses actually occur. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including client performance, the economy, changes in interest rates and property values, and the interpretation by regulatory authorities of loan classifications.   Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately and consider this process to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire loan portfolio.    At least quarterly, management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the allowance for loan losses and the underlying methodology. As of December 31, 2010, management deemed the allowance for loan losses to be adequate (i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the portfolio, including those not yet identifiable).    As an integral part of their examination process, various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.    The accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the allowance for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.         58           The following table presents changes in the allowance for loan losses, excluding covered assets, for the past five years.

The ratio of the reserve for loan losses to loans was 2.44% as of December 31, 2010, compared to 2.45% as of December 31, 2009. The loan loss allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 61% at December 31, 2010, compared to 56% at December 31, 2009. The provision for loan losses was $192.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, versus $198.9 million in the prior year period.    During 2010, net charge-offs totaled $190.9 million as compared to $89.9 million in the prior year period. Continued high levels of charge-offs reflect real estate collateral values, particularly land values, which have remained low. The provision for loan losses for 2010 exceeded net charge-offs by $1.1 million.         59           The following table presents our allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates shown.

The decrease in this allocation is due in part to a lower amount of loans in the commercial real estate sector at December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009, as well as a significant level of commercial real estate-related charge-offs during 2010. The allocated reserve for our commercial loan portfolio has increased $8.8 million, or 20%, to $52.1 million at December 31, 2010 from $43.4 million at December 31, 2009, which is reflective of the growth in balances of this loan product type.    General Allocated Component of the Allowance    The general allocated component of the allowance decreased by $4.1 million during 2010, from $155.9 million at December 31, 2009 to $151.9 million at December 31, 2010. The reduction in the general allocated reserve was primarily influenced by the improved risk profile of the performing portfolio during the year, the continued strategic shift away from commercial real estate exposure to commercial transactions, modest new loan growth, and the changing mix of the performing portfolio in which older legacy loans comprise a continually lower relative exposure in comparison to the total performing loans.    Specific Component of the Allowance   At December 31, 2010, the specific component of the allowance increased by $5.2 million to $71.0 million from $65.8 million at December 31, 2009. The specific reserve requirements are primarily influenced by new loan additions to nonperforming status, as well as changes to collateral values. Our impaired loans are primarily collateral-dependent with such loans totaling $398.0 million of the total $453.5 million in impaired loans at December 31, 2010.    Reserve for Unfunded Commitments   In addition to the allowance for loan losses, we maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities. At December 31, 2010, our reserve for unfunded commitments was $8.1 million, a $6.7 million increase over $1.5 million at December 31, 2009. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2010, we refined our methodology to calculate our unfunded commitment reserves on unfunded commitments to more closely align with the method we use to calculate our general component of our allowance. During 2010, we also increased the reserve to account for one partially drawn letter of credit that was issued on behalf of an obligor where the collectability is in doubt. These factors accounted for most of the increased unfunded commitment reserve during 2010. Unfunded commitments, excluding covered assets, totaled $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.         60           COVERED ASSETS    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Covered assets represent purchased loans and foreclosed loan collateral covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC as a result of the 2009 FDIC-assisted acquisition of the former Founders Banks from the FDIC, whereby the FDIC will reimburse us for the majority of future losses incurred on these assets existing at the date of acquisition. Under the terms of the loss-sharing agreements, the FDIC generally will assume 80% of the first $173 million of credit losses and 95% of the credit losses in excess of $173 million.    The carrying amounts of covered assets are presented in the following table:    Table 21    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Covered Assets    (Amounts in thousands)            0000000000     0000000000           December 31, 2010        December 31, 2009            Commercial loans      $  44,812         $  78,885         Commercial real estate loans         189,194            226,124         Residential mortgage loans         56,748            60,147         Consumer installment and other loans         9,129            13,438         Foreclosed real estate         32,155            14,770         Assets in lieu         469            560         Estimated loss reimbursement by the FDIC         64,703            108,110                                    Total covered assets         397,210            502,034         Allowance for covered loan losses         (15,334  )         (2,764  )                                 Net covered assets      $  381,876         $  499,270                                  Total covered assets decreased by $104.8 million, or 21%, from $502.0 million at December 31, 2009 to $397.2 million at December 31, 2010. The reduction is primarily attributable to $83.1 million in principal paydowns, net of advances, as well as the resulting impact of such on the evaluation of expected cash flows and discount accretion levels. In addition, the estimated loss reimbursement by the FDIC (the FDIC indemnification receivable) further contributed to the reduction as a result of loss claims paid by the FDIC. The allowance for covered loan losses increased by $12.5 million to $15.3 million at December 31, 2010 from $2.8 million at December 31, 2009, reflecting a further credit deterioration in expected cash flows on certain pools of covered loans since the date of acquisition. Of the total increase in the allowance for covered loan losses, 80% was offset through the FDIC indemnification receivable and the remaining 20% representing the non-reimbursable portion of the loss share agreement recognized as a charge to provision for loan and covered loan losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2010, the FDIC had reimbursed the Company $78.4 million in losses under the loss share agreements.   The following table presents covered loan delinquencies and nonperforming covered assets for the past two years and excludes purchased impaired loans which are accounted for on a pool basis. Since each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past due status of the pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. Because we are recognizing interest income on each pool of loans, they are all considered to be performing. These assets are excluded from the asset quality presentation of our originated loan portfolio, given the loss share indemnification from the FDIC.         61           Table 22    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Past Due Covered Loans and Nonperforming Covered Assets    (Amounts in thousands)             0000000000     0000000000           December 31,             2010         2009        30-59 days past due      $  5,885          $  8,312         60-89 days past due         2,853             4,992         90 days or more past due and still accruing         -             -         Nonaccrual         16,357             8,306                                     Total past due and nonperforming covered loans         25,095             21,610         Foreclosed real estate         32,155             14,770                                     Total past due and nonperforming covered assets      $  57,250          $  36,380                                   FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We have implemented various policies to manage our liquidity position to meet our cash flow requirements and maintain sufficient capacity to meet our clients needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations as well as unanticipated events. We also have in place contingency funding plans designed to allow us to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding may be constrained. As part of our asset/liability management strategy, we utilize a variety of funding sources in an effort to optimize the balance of duration risk, cost, liquidity risk and contingency planning.   The Banks principal sources of funds are client deposits, including large institutional deposits, wholesale market-based borrowings, capital contributions by the parent company, and cash from operations. The Banks principal uses of funds include funding growth in the core asset portfolios, including loans, and to a lesser extent, our investment portfolio, which is used primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk. The primary sources of funding for the holding company include dividends when received from its bank subsidiary, and proceeds from the issuance of senior, subordinated and convertible debt, as well as equity. Primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt, interest paid to our debt holders, dividends paid to stockholders, and subsidiary funding through capital contributions.   We consider client deposits our core funding source. At December 31, 2010, 80% of our total assets were funded by client deposits, compared to 77% at December 31, 2009. We define client deposits as all deposits other than traditional brokered deposits and non-client CDARS®. Time deposits are included as client deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us. Our client deposits are relatively concentrated given the nature of our business model, and we take this into account in managing our liquid asset levels. Liquid assets refer to cash on hand, federal funds sold, as well as available-for-sale securities. Net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and certain deposits that require collateral. Net liquid assets at the bank subsidiary were $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We maintain liquidity sufficient to meet client liquidity needs, fund loan growth, selectively purchase securities and investments and opportunistically pay down wholesale funds.    While we first look toward internally generated deposits as our funding source, we utilize wholesale funding, including brokered deposits, as needed to enhance liquidity and to fund asset growth. Brokered deposits are deposits that are sourced from external and unrelated financial institutions by a third-party. This funding requires advance notification to structure the type of deposit desired by the Bank, but brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of long-term funding. Our asset/liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered deposits, excluding reciprocal CDARS®, to levels no more than 25% of total deposits, and total brokered deposits to levels no more than 40% of total deposits. We do not expect these threshold limitations to limit our ability to grow.    Net cash inflows provided by operations were $208.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $86.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net cash outflows from investing activities were $504.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $993.0 million for prior year. Cash inflows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $410.9 million, compared to $1.2 billion in 2009.

These deposits are classified as brokered deposits for regulatory deposit purposes; however, we classify a portion of CDARS® as client CDARS® due to the source being our existing and new client relationships and are, therefore, not traditional brokered deposits. We also participate in a non-client CDARS® program that is more like a traditional brokered deposit program in that our relationship is with the underlying depositor.           (2)    Total deposits, net of traditional brokered deposits and non-client CDARS®.   Total deposits at December 31, 2010 increased 7% from year-end 2009 primarily due to growth in money market accounts and non-interest bearing demand deposits, offset by reductions in interest-bearing demand deposits, brokered deposits, and time deposits. Client deposits increased by $631.6 million, or 7%, to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $9.3 billion at December 31, 2009. During 2010, we pursued deposits from existing and new clients, increasing institutional and municipal deposits, and attracting additional business DDA account balances through our enhanced treasury management services. Total non-interest bearing deposits increased $412.8 million, or 22%, at December 31, 2010 from December 31, 2009. Deposit levels have benefited from higher liquidity levels businesses are maintaining generally, as well as our clients rotation into more liquid products.    Brokered deposits totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010, down 7% from $1.6 billion at December 31, 2009 and include $1.1 billion in CDARS® deposits, of which $852.5 million are client-related CDARS®. Brokered deposits, excluding client CDARS®, were 6% of total deposits at December 31, 2010 and 2009.    Public balances, denoting the funds held on account for municipalities and other public entities, are included as a part of our total deposits. We enter into specific agreements with certain public customers to pledge collateral, primarily securities, in support of the balances on account. These relationships also provide numerous cross-sell and business referral opportunities. At December 31, 2010, we had public funds on account totaling $937.5 million, of which less than 45% were collateralized with securities. Year-to-year changes in balances are influenced by the tax collection activities of the various municipalities as well as the general level of interest rates.         63           The following table presents our brokered and time deposits as of December 31, 2010, which are expected to mature during the period specified.

We expect short-term certificates of deposit to be renewed on terms and with maturities similar to those currently in place for at least the near term. In the event that time deposits are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the Bank, we expect to replace those deposits with traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowed money or capital, or we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs.

Short-term borrowings, which in 2010 primarily consisted of Federal Loan Home Bank (FHLB) advances that mature in one year or less, totaled $118.6 million at December 31, 2010, decreasing $96.4 million from December 31, 2009. The reduction in borrowings during 2010 is largely attributable to the repayment of maturing FHLB advances. We replaced this funding with increased levels of client deposits. During 2009, the Company participated in the FRBs Term Auction Facility (TAF), a temporary credit program made available to banking institutions as part of the U.S. Governments economic stabilization initiatives. These borrowings were fully repaid by the Bank during the second half of 2009 and the program itself was discontinued in 2010.   In addition to on-balance sheet liquidity and funding, the Bank maintains access to various external sources of funding, which assist in the prudent management of funding costs, interest rate risk, and anticipated funding needs or other considerations. Some sources of funding are accessible same-day while others require advance notice. Funds that are immediately accessible include Federal Fund counterparty lines, which are uncommitted lines of credit from other financial institutions, and the borrowing term is typically overnight. Federal Fund lines fluctuate based on availability in the market place and counterparty relationship strength. Repurchase agreements or Repos are also an immediate source of funding in which the Bank pledges assets to a counterparty against which the Bank can borrow with the agreement to repurchase at a specified date in the future. Repos can vary in term, from overnight to longer but are regarded as short-term in nature. An additional source of overnight funding is the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank maintains access to the discount window by pledging loans as collateral to the Federal Reserve. Funding availability is primarily dictated by the amount of loans pledged by the Bank, but also impacted by the margin applied to the loans by the Federal        65            Reserve. The amount of loans pledged to the Federal Reserve can fluctuate due to the availability of loans eligible under the Federal Reserves criteria which include stipulations of documentation requirements, credit quality, payment status and other criteria.    The Bank had unused overnight fed funds borrowings available for use of $95.0 million at December 31, 2010 and $376.0 million at December 31, 2009. Our total availability of overnight fed fund borrowings is not a committed line of credit and is dependent upon lender availability. At December 31, 2010, we also had $536.8 million in borrowing capacity through the FRB discount windows primary credit program, which includes federal term auction facilities, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009. Our borrowing capacity under this program, which we regard as a contingent funding source, changes each quarter subject to available collateral and FRB discount factors. The reduced availability at the FRB discount window was predominately attributable to fewer loans meeting the FRB pledging guidelines. We continue to add eligible loans to the collateral pool and as of March 1, 2011 we had $796.4 million in borrowing capacity.   Long-term debt which is comprised of junior subordinated debentures, $120.0 million in a subordinated debt facility and the long-term portion of FHLB advances, totaled $414.8 million at December 31, 2010, decreasing $118.2 million from $533.0 million at December 31, 2009. The current year reduction is due to the movement of the current portion of FHLB advances from long-term classification to short-term. The weighted average interest rate of long-term FHLB advances at December 31, 2010 was 4.39% compared to 2.97% at December 31, 2009.   Over the past three years, we merged former bank subsidiaries that were member banks of the FHLB into the PrivateBank-Chicago. The PrivateBank-Chicago is currently not a member bank and until it becomes a member, does not have access to additional FHLB borrowings. Advances prior to the bank mergers remain outstanding until maturity.   During 2010 there was no change in outstanding balances of junior subordinated debentures and the subordinated debt facility, totaling in aggregate $364.8 million at year-end 2009 and 2010. However, effective in the latter part of 2010, the interest rate on $92.8 million of junior subordinated debentures moved from fixed rate to variable in accordance with the original terms of the debentures, effectively reducing interest paid thereon from a weighted average 6.04% at December 31, 2009 to a weighted average 1.92% at December 31, 2010.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Refer to Notes 11 and 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details regarding the junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt facility.    CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES   Through our normal course of operations, we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments. Such obligations generally relate to the funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances, as well as leases for premises and equipment. As a financial services provider, we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit. While contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process as all comparable loans we make.   The following table presents our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and significant commitments as of December 31, 2010 which are expected to come due and payable during the period specified. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements.         66           Table 26    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingencies, and Off-Balance Sheet Items    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(Amounts in thousands)                                                Payments Due In STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(2)                               Financial Statement STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Note Reference (1)      Less Than One Year         One to Three Years         Three to Five Years         Over Five Years         Total                Deposits without a stated maturity      9      $  7,692,245          $  -          $  -          $  -          $  7,692,245         Time deposits      9         1,029,325             245,863             116,784             385             1,392,357         Brokered deposits STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(3)      9         1,371,072             73,793             5,962             -             1,450,827         Short-term borrowings      10         118,561             -             -             -             118,561         Long-term debt      11         -             40,000             125,000             249,793             414,793         Operating leases      7         11,039             22,113             22,132             62,352             117,636         Purchase obligations STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(4)      -         42,435             50,795             54,110             -             147,340                 Commitments to extend credit:                                             Home equity lines      19                                     175,365         All other commitments      19                                     3,695,672                 Letters of credit:                                             Standby      19                                     298,100         Commercial         19                                             115                              (1)    Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.           (2)    In the banking industry, interest-bearing obligations are principally utilized to fund interest-earning assets. As such, interest charges on related contractual obligations were excluded from reported amounts as the potential cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows form interest-earning assets.           (3)    Includes $314,000 of unamortized broker commissions.           (4)    Purchase obligations exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statements of financial condition.    Our operating lease obligations represent short- and long-term lease and rental payments for facilities, equipment, and certain software or data processing.    Purchase obligations at December 31, 2010 reflect the minimum obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. Our purchase obligations include payments under, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, data, advertising, sponsorships, software license and telecommunications. Purchase obligations also includes the estimated cash severance amounts (not prohibited under the executive compensation restrictions applicable to TARP CPP participants) due to employees under employment contracts and arrangements, assuming an involuntary termination date of December 31, 2010.    Our commitments to fund civic and community investments, which represent future cash outlays for the construction and development of properties for low-income housing, small business real estate, and historic tax credit projects that qualify for CRA purposes, are not included in the contractual obligations table above. The timing and amounts of these commitments are projected based upon the financing arrangements provided in each projects partnership or operating agreement, and could change due to variances in the construction schedule, project revisions, or the cancellation of the project.    As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $631,000 of unrecognized tax benefits (exclusive of net interest expense accruals) that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. Because the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, this estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information and disclosure related to uncertain tax positions.    CAPITAL RESOURCES   Equity decreased by $7.7 million, or 0.6%, during 2010 due primarily to a decline in unrealized gains on our available-for-sale securities portfolio recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.         67           Capital Issuances    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During 2010, we did not have any common or preferred stock offerings. The following is a summary of 2009 capital raising activities.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Issuance of Preferred Stock    In January 2009, we sold 243,815 shares of a newly created class of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B to the Treasury as part of the TARP CPP Program. We also issued to the Treasury a ten-year warrant to purchase up to approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock, or 15% of the aggregate dollar amount of Series B preferred shares purchased by the Treasury, at an exercise price of $28.35 per share. In December 2009 as a result of the completion of the 2009 offerings, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant held by the Treasury was reduced by 50% from 1,290,026 to 645,013 shares. The Series B preferred stock and warrants qualify for regulatory Tier 1 capital and the preferred stock may be redeemed at any time subject to regulatory approval. Following a redemption of the preferred stock, the warrants may be liquidated by the Treasury, through either a redemption at market prices or through a sale by the Treasury to a third party. The preferred stock has a dividend rate of 5% for the first five years, increasing to 9% thereafter. Among other things, we are subject to restrictions and conditions including those related to the payment of dividends on our common stock, share repurchases, executive compensation, and corporate governance. We have deployed this new capital mainly to support prudent new lending in the markets we serve. Refer to 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) in Supervision and Regulation and Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Item 1 and Item 8, respectively, of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the CPP and TARP programs.   Issuance of Common Stock    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During 2009, we undertook two common equity raises, in addition to converting existing preferred shares to common capital.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In May 2009, we issued approximately 11.6 million shares of newly issued common stock at a public offering price of $19.25 per share. We granted the underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1.74 million shares which they partially exercised and purchased an additional 266,673 shares. The net proceeds from the offering, including the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, were approximately $217 million after deducting underwriting commissions but before offering expenses.    In June 2009, we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (1) create a new class of non-voting common stock (the Non-voting Common Stock), and (2) amend and restate the Certificate of Designations of the Companys Series A Junior Nonvoting Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) to provide, among other things, that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible only into shares of Non-voting Common Stock. Under the amended terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of Non-voting Common Stock. On June 17, 2009, we issued 1,951,037 shares of Non-voting Common Stock to GTCR upon notice of conversion by GTCR of all of its 1,951.037 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. This transaction resulted in a reclassification of preferred stock capital to common stock capital and did not increase total stockholders equity. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock held and converted by GTCR represented all of the authorized, issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock on such date. We also entered into an amendment to our existing Preemptive and Registration Rights Agreement with GTCR pursuant to which we agree, among other things, to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the newly issued shares of Non-voting Common Stock for resale under the Securities Act of 1933.   In November 2009, we closed an underwritten public offering of common stock, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option, and issued a total of approximately 22.2 million shares for net proceeds of approximately $181.2 million after deducting underwriting commissions. Of that amount, approximately $35.3 million was purchased by certain funds managed by GTCR. In addition, GTCR purchased approximately $12.8 million of non-voting common stock of the Company, equating to 1.6 million shares, through an exercise of its existing preemptive rights.   The net proceeds from both the 2009 public offerings, as well as from the sale of non-voting common stock, qualify as tangible common equity and Tier 1 capital and are being used to further capitalize our subsidiary banks in order to support continued growth and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including possible FDIC-assisted acquisition transactions subject to satisfying eligibility requirements to participate in such transactions.    Capital Management   Under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank are subject to various capital requirements adopted and administered by the federal banking agencies. These guidelines specify minimum capital ratios calculated in accordance with the definitions in the guidelines, including the leverage ratio which is Tier 1 capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets, and the Tier 1 capital ratio and the total capital ratio each as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories. These minimum ratios are shown in the table below.        68           To satisfy safety and soundness standards, banking institutions are expected to maintain capital levels in excess of the regulatory minimums depending on the risk inherent in the balance sheet, regulatory expectations and the changing risk profile of business activities and plans. Under our capital planning policy, we target capital ratios at levels we believe are appropriate based on such risk considerations, taking into account the current operating and economic environment, internal risk guidelines, and our strategic objectives as well as regulatory expectations. At the Bank, primarily due to our recent credit loss experience and levels of non-performing loans, the current minimum capital requirements are ratios of 8.25% Tier 1 leverage and 12.0% total risk-based capital. Our current plans are to continue to manage growth within our existing capital base and we do not currently have plans to raise additional capital in the near term.    The following table presents information about our capital measures and the related regulatory capital guidelines.

Refer to Table 28, Non-U.S. GAAP Measures for a reconciliation from non-U.S. GAAP to U.S. GAAP.    As of December 31, 2010, all of our $244.8 million of outstanding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securities (Debentures) are included in Tier 1 capital. The Tier 1 qualifying amount is limited to 25% of Tier 1 capital under FRB regulations. For a full description of our Debentures and contingent convertible senior notes, refer to Notes 11 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.         69           For further details of the regulatory capital requirements and ratios as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 for the Company and the Bank, refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Dividends    We declared dividends of $0.04 per common share during 2010. Based on the closing stock price at December 31, 2010 of $14.38, the annualized dividend yield on our common stock was 0.28%. Although we currently intend to continue to pay dividends on our common stock and our preferred stock at the current levels, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so.    As a result of our participation in the TARP CPP, we are subject to various restrictions on our ability to increase the cash dividends we pay on our common stock above the quarterly rate of $0.075 per share, the rate in effect when our participation in TARP CPP began. In light of the recent losses we have incurred, we provide notice to and obtain approval from the FRB before declaring or paying any dividends. For additional information regarding limitations and restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, refer to the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections.    The dividend payout ratio, which represents the percentage of dividends declared to stockholders to earnings per share, was -23.5% for 2010 and -4.2% for 2009. The dividend payout ratio has averaged approximately 7.2% for the past five years.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Stock Repurchase Program    Our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to the applicable restrictions of the CPP following the sale of the preferred stock to the Treasury under the TARP program. Please refer to EESA in Supervision and Regulation of Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the CPP and TARP programs.    In connection with restrictions on stock repurchases as part of the CPP, we terminated our repurchase program in February 2009. The restrictions on repurchases will not affect our ability to repurchase shares in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans, as such transactions are in the ordinary course and consistent with our past practice. During 2010, we repurchased 115,461 shares with a value of $13.56 per share with all repurchases associated with shares submitted in satisfaction of taxes and/or exercise price amounts in connection with the settlement of share-based compensation awards.    IMPACT OF INFLATION   Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry. Under these principles and practices, we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.    Unlike many industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation.    NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURES    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">This report contains both U.S. GAAP and non-U.S. GAAP based financial measures. These non-U.S. GAAP measures include net interest income, net interest margin, net revenue, operating profit, and efficiency ratio all on a fully taxable-equivalent basis; tier 1 common capital, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible equity to tangible assets, and tangible equity to risk-weighted assets. We believe that presenting these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures will provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance, our business, and performance trends and facilitates comparisons with the performance of others in the banking industry.   We use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating various performance measures by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments assuming a 35% tax rate. Management believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it enhances comparability to net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources, and accordingly believes that providing this measure may be useful for peer comparison purposes.   We also consider various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including tier 1 common capital, tangible common equity ratio, tangible equity to tangible assets, and tangible equity to risk-weighted assets, in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. Certain of these measures exclude the ending balances of goodwill and other intangibles and/or         70            preferred capital components. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, we believe there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. We believe these non-U.S. GAAP measures are relevant because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of our capitalization to other companies. However, because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios, our calculations may not be comparable with other companies, and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited.   Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under U.S. GAAP. As a result, we encourage readers to consider our Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments based on information available at the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future changes in information may affect these estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which, in turn, may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.    Our most significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Item 8 of this Form 10-K. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other consolidated financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has determined that our accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes are the        72            accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to our financial position and results of operations, and, as such, are considered to be critical accounting policies, as discussed below.    Allowance for Loan Losses   We maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired (the asset-specific component), as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio that are not specifically identified (the general allocated component), which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio and managements judgment.    The asset-specific component relates to impaired loans. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, management believes that it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans and loans classified as a troubled debt restructuring. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the loans observable fair value, fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by creating a specific valuation reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans exceeding a fixed dollar amount are evaluated individually, while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of asset and product type.    At the time a collateral-dependent loan is initially determined to be impaired, we review the existing collateral appraisal. If the most recent appraisal is greater than a year old, a new appraisal is obtained on the underlying collateral. Appraisals on impaired collateral-dependent loans are reviewed as received and again at each succeeding six-month interval. If during the course of the six-month review period there is evidence supporting a meaningful decline in the value of collateral, a new appraisal is required to support the value of the impaired loan.   To determine the general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses, we aggregate loans by originating line of business for reserve purposes because of observable similarities in the performance experience of loans underwritten by the business units. Loans originated by the business units that existed prior to the strategic changes in 2007 are considered legacy loans. Loans originated by a business unit that was established in connection with or following the business transformation plan are considered transformational loans. Renewals or restructurings of legacy loans may continue to be evaluated as legacy loans depending on the details of the individual notes structure or defining characteristics. The Company has implemented a line of business model that has reorganized the legacy business units so that after 2009, all new loan originations are considered transformational. The methodology produces an estimated range of potential loss exposure for the product types within our transformational and legacy loan portfolios. We consider the appropriate place within or outside the ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by the model that includes market and economic data and management judgment. We also assess the general allocated component estimate in total and consider whether, based on managements judgment, any upwards or downwards adjustment is appropriate based on general and industry specific economic data and indicators.   Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends, all of which may be susceptible to significant change.   Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in managements judgment is appropriate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets   Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability.         73           Goodwill is allocated to business segments at acquisition. Fair values of reporting units are determined using a combination of market-based valuation multiples for comparable businesses if available and discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired.    Goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired, a noncash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded in earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible or regulatory capital.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit. In step one, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and step two is not considered necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the impairment test continues (step two) by comparing the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value is computed by adjusting all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to current fair value with the offset adjustment to goodwill. The adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value of the goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying fair value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.   Goodwill impairment testing is considered a critical accounting estimate as estimates and assumptions are made about future performance and cash flows, as well as other prevailing market factors. For our annual impairment testing, we engage an independent valuation firm to assist in the computation of the fair value estimates of each reporting unit as part of its impairment assessment. In connection with obtaining an independent third party valuation, management provides certain information and assumptions that are utilized in the implied fair value calculation. Assumptions critical to the process include discount rates, asset and liability growth rates, and other income and expense estimates. We provide the best information available at the time to estimate future performance for each reporting unit.   Identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and are subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All of the other intangible assets have finite lives which are amortized over varying periods not exceeding 15 years and include core deposit premiums that use an accelerated method of amortization and client relationship intangibles and assembled workforce which are amortized on a straight line basis.    Income Taxes    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The determination of income tax expense or benefit, and the amounts of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on a complex analyses of many factors, including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws, current financial accounting standards, the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities (temporary differences), assessments of the likelihood that the reversals of deferred deductible temporary differences will yield tax benefits, and estimates of reserves required for tax uncertainties.    We are subject to the federal income tax laws of the United States and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business. We periodically undergo examination by various governmental taxing authorities. Such authorities may require that changes in the amount of tax expense be recognized when their interpretations of tax law differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions, new interpretations of existing law or positions by federal or state taxing authorities, will not result in tax liability amounts that differ from our current assessment of such amounts, the impact of which could be significant to future results.    Temporary differences may give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods based on weighing both positive and negative evidence and establish a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets for which recovery is unlikely, based on a standard of more likely than not. In making this assessment, we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize these assets through: (a) the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, (b) future taxable income, (c) the possible application of future tax planning strategies, and (d) carryback to taxable income in prior years. We have not established a valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010. However, there is no guarantee that the tax benefits associated with these deferred tax assets will be fully realized. We have concluded, as of December 31, 2010, that it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized.    In the preparation of income tax returns, tax positions are taken based on interpretation of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of such positions may not be certain. We periodically review and evaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for tax benefits that may not be realized. The amount of any such reserves are based on the standards for determining such reserves as set forth in current accounting guidance and our estimates of amounts that may ultimately be due or        74            owed (including interest). These estimates may change from time to time based on our evaluation of developments subsequent to the filing of the income tax return, such as tax authority audits, court decisions or other tax law interpretations. There can be no assurance that any tax reserves will be sufficient to cover tax liabilities that may ultimately be determined to be owed. At December 31, 2010, we had $631,000 of tax reserves established relating to uncertain tax positions that would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized in future periods.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    As a continuing part of our financial strategy and in accordance with our asset/liability management policies, we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income. This effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield. Our asset/liability management policies set standards within which we are expected to operate and include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations, liquidity, asset limits as a percentage of funding sources, exposure to correspondent banks and brokers, and reliance on non-core deposits. Our asset/liability management policies also establish criteria by which we may purchase securities which include approved types of securities, brokerage sources, terms of investment, quality standards, and diversification.    We attempt to structure our assets and liabilities to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment. Depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short- and long-term, we generally operate within the guidelines set by our asset/liability management policies and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk. We have not used hedging activities as part of our asset/liability management in recent years, but may pursue hedging strategies, as appropriate, to augment our risk management in the future.    Interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. There are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our Consolidated Statements of Income.   Our primary method of estimating the potential impact of interest rate changes on our income statement is through the use of a simulation model based on our interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability portfolios, assuming the size of these portfolios remains constant throughout the twelve month measurement period. The simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis. Assets and liabilities then re-price based on current terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period. The model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred. The following table shows the estimated impact of an immediate change in interest rates as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.   Analysis of Net Interest Income Sensitivity    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">(Dollars in thousands)                                       Immediate Change in Rates                    -50        +50         +100         +200         +300        December 31, 2010:                                       Dollar change      $  (8,800  )      $  12,245          $  25,144          $  53,152          $  84,492         Percent change         -2.3%            3.1%             6.5%             13.7%             21.7%         December 31, 2009:                                       Dollar change      $  6,623         $  21,576          $  31,959          $  54,568          $  79,604         Percent change         1.8%            5.8%             8.6%             14.7%             21.5%       The estimated impact to our net interest income over a one year period is reflected in dollar terms and percentage change. As an example, this table illustrates that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of +100 basis points on December 31, 2010, net interest income would increase by $25.1 million or 6.5% over a one-year period, as compared to a net interest income increase of $32.0 million or 8.6% if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of +100 basis points at December 31, 2009.    Changes in the effect on net interest income at December 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009 are due to the timing and nature of the re-pricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame. Interest rate sensitivity declined in 2010 compared to 2009, except at +300 basis points where sensitivity increased, as measured by the percent of change in interest income and in absolute dollar impact. The decline is due to several factors including a general decline in interest rates which had the effect of triggering a greater proportion of loan floors, transforming previously floating loans into fixed rate loans with less interest sensitivity. In addition, as the investment portfolio has become a greater percentage of our asset base with a longer duration than the loan portfolio, it has lowered overall sensitivity to interest rate risk within the asset portfolio. Further, growth within money market         75            deposits and reductions in time deposits has resulted in a more rate sensitive liability portfolio, which offsets the sensitivity of the asset base. The net result of these changes is a reduction in interest rate sensitivity.    The preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve, prepayments on loans and securities, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others. While our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change.   We continue to monitor our rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates. We have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets, purchase or sell investment securities, or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk.         76           ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Shareholders of PrivateBancorp, Inc.:    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of PrivateBancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of PrivateBancorp, Inc.s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

notes to consolidated financial statements.         83           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Nature of Operations   PrivateBancorp, Inc. (PrivateBancorp or the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in 1989 and became a holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The PrivateBank and Trust Company (PrivateBank-Chicago or the Bank), the sole banking subsidiary of PrivateBancorp, was opened in Chicago in 1991. The Company completed its initial public offering in June of 1999. The Bank provides customized business and personal financial services to middle-market companies and business owners, executives, entrepreneurs and families in seven geographic markets in the Midwest, as well as Denver and Atlanta. The majority of the Banks business is conducted in the greater Chicago market.    Principles of Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Assets held in a fiduciary or agency capacity are not assets of the subsidiaries and, accordingly, are not included in the consolidated financial statements.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Basis of Presentation   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, management has defined cash and cash equivalents to include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and other short-term investments. Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods, but not longer than 30 days. Short-term investments generally mature in less than 30 days. We use the accrual basis of accounting for financial reporting purposes.    In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we have considered the impact of events occurring subsequent to December 31, 2010 for potential recognition or disclosure in this annual report on Form 10-K.   Use of Estimates   The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and general practice within the banking industry. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies adhered to in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.    Business Combinations   Business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, assets and liabilities of the business acquired are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition, with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the effective date of acquisition.   Investment Securities Available-for-Sale   At the time of purchase, investment securities are classified as available-for-sale as management has the intent and ability to hold such securities for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell available-for-sale securities would be based on various factors, including, but not limited to asset/liability management strategies, changes in interest rates or prepayment risks, liquidity needs, or regulatory capital considerations. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, recorded in equity as a separate component of other comprehensive income (OCI).    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The historical cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts over the estimated life of the security, using the level-yield method. In determining the estimated life of a mortgage-backed security, certain judgments are required as to the timing and amount of future principal prepayments. These judgments are made based on the actual performance of the underlying security and the general market consensus regarding changes in mortgage interest rates and underlying prepayment estimates. Amortization of premium and accretion of discount are included in interest income from the related security.   Purchases and sales of securities are recognized on a trade date basis. Realized securities gains or losses are reported in net securities gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. On a quarterly basis, we make an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or circumstances to indicate that a security for which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary (OTTI) basis. This determination requires significant judgment. OTTI is considered to have occurred (1) if management intends to sell the security, (2) if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the present value of the expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For debt securities that we do not expect to sell or it is not more likely than not to be required to sell, the OTTI is separated into credit and noncredit components. The credit-related OTTI, represented by the expected loss in principal, is recognized in non-interest income, while noncredit-related OTTI is recognized in OCI. Noncredit-related OTTI results from other factors, including increased liquidity spreads and extension of the security. For securities which we do expect to         84            sell, all OTTI is recognized in earnings. Presentation of OTTI is made in the income statement on a gross basis with a reduction for the amount of OTTI recognized in OCI. Once an other-than-temporary impairment is recorded, when future cash flows can be reasonably estimated, future cash flows are re-allocated between interest and principal cash flows to provide for a level-yield on the security.   Loans Held for Sale   Loans held for sale (LHFS) represent mortgage loan originations intended to be sold in the secondary market and other loans that management has an active plan to sell. LHFS are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined on an aggregate basis by type of loan or carried at fair value where the Company has elected fair value accounting. The credit component of any write-down upon transfer of loans to LHFS is reflected in charge-offs. Where an election is made to subsequently carry the LHFS at fair value, any further decreases or subsequent increases in fair value are recognized in non-interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Where an election is made to subsequently carry LHFS at lower of cost or fair value (as is the case with mortgage loan originations), any decreases in value below cost are recognized in mortgage banking revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income and increases in fair value above cost are not recognized until the loans are sold. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates or, in the case where a firm commitment has been made to sell the loan, the firm committed price. Gains and losses on the disposition of loans held for sale are determined on the specific identification method. Mortgage loans sold in the secondary market are sold without retaining servicing rights.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Loans   Loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees or costs, and any direct principal charge-offs. Interest income on loans is accrued based on principal amounts outstanding. Loan origination fees, fees for commitments that are expected to be exercised and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net amount amortized over the estimated life of the related loan or commitment period as a yield adjustment. Other credit-related fees are recognized as fee income when earned.   Delinquent and Nonaccrual Loans   Loans are considered past due or delinquent if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payment is due. Generally, loans (including impaired loans) are placed on nonaccrual status: (a) when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms; or (b) when an individual analysis of a borrowers creditworthiness indicates a loan should be placed on nonaccrual status rather than waiting until the loan becomes 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income may only be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest payments become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and when the financial position of the borrower and other relevant factors indicate there is no longer doubt as to such collectability.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Loans are generally charged-off when deemed uncollectible. A loss is recorded at that time if the net realizable value can be quantified and it is less than the associated principal and interest.   Impaired Loans   A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the loans observable fair value, the fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. For financial reporting purposes, impaired loans include nonaccrual loans and loans classified as a troubled debt restructuring.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (including accrued interest, net of deferred loan fees and costs and unamortized premium or discount), impairment is recognized by creating a specific reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans exceeding a fixed dollar amount are evaluated individually, while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of asset and product type. Impaired loans with specific reserves are reviewed quarterly for any changes that would affect the specific reserve. Any impaired loan for which a determination has been made that the economic value is permanently reduced is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses to reflect its current economic value in the period in which the determination has been made.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">At the time a collateral-dependent loan is initially determined to be impaired, we review the existing collateral appraisal. If the most recent appraisal is greater than a year old, a new appraisal is obtained on the underlying collateral. Appraisals on impaired collateral dependent loans are reviewed as received and again at each succeeding six month interval. If during the course of the six-month review period there is evidence supporting a meaningful decline in the value of collateral, a new appraisal is required to support the value of the impaired loan.         85           Restructured Loans    A loan is accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties that leads to a restructuring of the loan, and the Company grants concessions to the borrower in the restructuring that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions may include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, extension of maturity date and other actions intended to minimize potential losses. Restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. The Company may utilize a multiple note structure as a workout alternative for certain loans. The multiple note typically structures a troubled loan into two notes, where the first note is reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to the prudently modified terms and the portion of the troubled loan that is not reasonably assured of repayment is charged-off.   Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured remains on nonaccrual for a period of six months to ensure that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However, the borrowers performance prior to the restructuring or other significant events at the time of the restructuring may be considered in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual status after a shorter performance period or concurrent with the restructuring. In such situations, the loan will be reported as a restructured loan accruing interest. If the borrowers performance under the new terms is not reasonably assured, the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan.    The allowance for loan losses on restructured loans is determined by discounting the restructured cash flows by the original effective rate, or if collateral dependent, by obtaining an appraisal. Loans restructured at a rate equal to or greater than that of a new loan with comparable risk at the time the contract is modified may be excluded from the impairment assessment and may cease to be considered impaired in the calendar years subsequent to the restructuring if they are in compliance with modified terms.   Allowance for Loan Losses   We maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents our estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired (the asset-specific component), as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio that are not specifically identified, which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of the loan portfolio and managements judgment (the general allocated component).    The determination of the asset-specific component is discussed above in impaired loans.   To determine the general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses, we aggregate loans by originating line of business because of observable similarities in the performance experience of loans underwritten by the business units. The methodology takes into account at a product level the originating line of business, the origination year, the risk rating migration of the note, and historical default and loss history of similar products. Using this information, the methodology produces a range of possible reserve amounts by product. We consider the appropriate place within or outside the ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by the model that includes market and economic data and management judgment. We also assess the general allocated component estimate in total and consider whether, based on managements judgment, any upwards or downwards adjustment is appropriate based on general and industry specific economic data, credit trends, information outside the model and other relevant indicators.         86           The product segments we evaluate in the general reserve methodology are commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, constructions loans and consumer loans (which include personal loans, residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit). Our commercial loan portfolio includes lines of credit to businesses, term loans and letters of credit. Certain non-residential owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are included in our commercial loan portfolio where the cash flows from the owners business serve as the primary source of loan repayment. Commercial loans contain risks unique to the business and market of each borrower and the repayment is dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Commercial real estate loans are comprised of loans secured by various types of collateral including 1-4 family non-owner occupied housing units located primarily in our target market areas, multi-family real estate, office buildings, warehouses, retail space, mixed use buildings, and vacant land, the bulk of which is held for long-term investment or development. Risks inherent in real estate lending are related to the market value of the property taken as collateral, the underlying cash flows and documentation and the general economic condition of the market in which the collateral is located. Repayment is generally dependent on the successful operation of the business occupying the property.    Our construction loan portfolio consists of single-family residential properties, multi-family properties, and commercial projects, and includes both investment properties and properties that will be owner-occupied. Risks inherent in construction lending are similar to those in commercial real estate lending. Additional risks include the cost and time frame of constructing or improving a property, the borrowers inability to use funds generated by a project to service a loan until a project is completed, the more pronounced risk to interest rate movements and the real estate market that these borrowers face while a project is being completed or seeking a buyer and the availability of permanent financing. Because of the nature of construction loans, as a product segment, these loans have the highest inherent risk in our portfolio and are often the highest yielding loans in our portfolio.    Consumer loans are a smaller portion of our overall portfolio and consist of residential home mortgages, home equity lines of credit and personal loans. The risk issues associated with these products are closely correlated to the U.S. housing market and the local markets in which the collateral resides and include home price indices, sales volume, unemployment rates, vacancy rates, foreclosure rates, loan to value ratios, and delinquency rates. Some personal loans may be unsecured.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends, all of which may be susceptible to significant change.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in managements judgment is appropriate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.   Reserve for Unfunded Commitments   We maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities. The reserve is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The reserve is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses and is based on model which uses recent commitment utilization patterns at the product level as a method of predicting future usage across the portfolio. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Purchased Loans   Purchased loans acquired through portfolio purchases or in a business combination are accounted for under specialized accounting guidance when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration at the time of acquisition and for which it is probable that not all contractual payments will be collected (purchased impaired loans). Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, declines in current borrower FICO scores, geographic concentration and declines in current loan-to-value ratios. U.S. GAAP requires these loans to be recorded at fair value at acquisition date and prohibits the carrying over or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting for loans acquired in a transfer.    The fair values for purchased impaired loans are determined by discounting both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value. We estimate the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition using internal models that incorporate managements best estimate of current key assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and payment speeds.   Under the applicable accounting guidance for purchased impaired loans, any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method when there is a reasonable expectation about amount and timing of such cash flows. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for covered loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for covered loan losses to the extent of prior charges or a reclassification of the difference from non-accretable to accretable with a positive impact on interest income. Purchased impaired loans are accounted for on a pool basis as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Because we are recognizing interest income on each pool of loans, they are all considered to be performing.    For purchased loans not subject to the specialized accounting guidance (purchased non-impaired loans), which are recorded at their fair value at date of acquisition, differences between the purchase price and the unpaid principal balance at the date of acquisition are recorded in interest income over the life of the loan. Decreases in expected cash flows after the purchase date are recognized by recording an additional allowance for credit losses.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Covered Assets   Purchased loans and foreclosed loan collateral covered under loss sharing or similar credit protection agreements with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are reported separately on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition inclusive of the fair value of expected reimbursement cash flows the Company expects to receive from the FDIC under those agreements. Similarly, provision for subsequent credit losses on those assets are recorded net of the expected reimbursement from the FDIC.   Other Real Estate Owned   Other real estate owned (OREO) is comprised of property acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in partial or total satisfaction of certain loans. Properties are recorded at the lower of the         87            recorded investment in the loan at the time of acquisition or the fair value, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Any write-downs in the carrying value of a property at the time of acquisition are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent write-downs to reflect current fair market value, as well as gains or losses on disposition and revenues or expenses incurred in maintaining such properties are treated as period costs and reported in non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.   Depreciable Assets   Premises, furniture and equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is determined by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the life of the asset or the lease term. Rates of depreciation are generally based on the following useful lives: buildings, 30-40 years; leasehold improvements, typically 1-16 years; and furniture and equipment, 3-7 years. Gains on dispositions are included in other income, and losses on dispositions are included in other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses as incurred, while improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining life.    Long-lived depreciable assets are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the expected undiscounted future cash flows of a long-lived asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, the Company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset based on a quoted market price, if applicable, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses are recorded in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI)   BOLI represents life insurance policies on the lives of certain Company officers for which the Company is the beneficiary. These policies are recorded as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at their cash surrender value, or the amount that could be realized currently. The change in cash surrender value and insurance proceeds received are recorded as BOLI income in non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level at least annually for impairment or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. The Company has determined that its operating segments qualify as reporting units under U.S. GAAP. Fair values of reporting units are determined using a combination of market-based valuation multiples for comparable businesses if available, and discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and are subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All of the Companys other intangible assets have finite lives and are amortized over varying periods not exceeding 15 years.    Fiduciary Assets and Assets Under Management   Assets held in a fiduciary capacity for clients are not included in the consolidated financial statements as they are not assets of the Company or its subsidiaries. Fiduciary and asset management fees are generally determined based upon market values of assets under management as of a specified date during the period and are included as a component of non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Brokered Deposits   We utilize brokered deposits as liquidity and asset-liability management tools in the normal course of business. Certain brokered deposits we issue contain a purchased option, retained by us, to call (redeem) the brokered deposit prior to maturity at a specified date. Upon issuance of brokered deposits, we record a liability that reflects the fees paid to brokers for raising the funds in the retail market. The deferred broker commissions are amortized to interest expense as an adjustment to the brokered deposit yield over the contractual maturity of the brokered deposit. In the event we notify the certificate holders of our intent to exercise the call option on the callable brokered deposit, the remaining unamortized broker commissions are amortized to the call date.    Advertising Costs   All advertising costs are expensed in the period they are incurred.    Loss Contingencies   Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.   Derivative Financial Instruments   In the ordinary course of business, we enter into derivative transactions as part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as either other assets or other liabilities. Subsequent changes in a derivatives fair value are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.         88           On the date we enter into a derivative contract, we designate the derivative instrument as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or as a freestanding derivative instrument. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered to be fair value hedges. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows to be received or paid related to an asset or liability or other types of forecasted transactions are considered to be cash flow hedges. We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.    For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge and are effective, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income. The unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (for example, when a hedged item is terminated or redesignated). For all hedge relationships, derivative gains and losses not effective in hedging the change in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of change.    At the hedges inception and at least quarterly thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future. If a derivative instrument designated as a hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively and the gain or loss is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged asset or liability (fair value hedge) or over the same period(s) that the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings (cash flow hedge). If the hedged item is disposed of, or the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, any fair value adjustments are included in the gain or loss from the disposition of the hedged item. In the case of a forecasted transaction that is no longer probable, the gain or loss is included in earnings immediately.    We also offer various derivative products to clients and enter into derivative transactions in due course. The transactions are not linked to specific Company assets or liabilities in the balance or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. They are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as derivative assets and derivative liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in capital market product revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.   Income Taxes   The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax return. The provision for income taxes is based on income reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, rather than amounts reported on our income tax return.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Deferred income taxes are provided for all significant items of income and expense that are recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes and income tax reporting purposes. The asset and liability approach is used for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. This approach requires us to take into account changes in the tax rates when valuing deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. We recognize a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences. Temporary differences include differences between financial statement income and tax return income which are expected to reverse in future periods, as well as differences between tax bases of assets and liabilities and their amounts for financial reporting purposes which are also expected to be settled in future periods. Generally, to the extent a deferred tax asset is established which is not more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance will be established against such asset.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We periodically review and evaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for tax benefits that may not be realized. The amount of any such reserves are based on the standards for determining such reserves as set forth in current accounting guidance and our estimates of amounts that may ultimately be due or owed, including interest.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Net Earnings Per Common Share (EPS)   Basic EPS is calculated using the two-class method to determine income attributable to common stockholders. The two-class method requires undistributed earnings for the period, which represents net income less common and participating security dividends (if applicable) declared or paid, to be allocated between the common and participating security stockholders based upon their respective rights to receive dividends. Participating securities include unvested restricted shares/units that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends. Income attributable to common stockholders is then divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period. The basic EPS computation excludes the dilutive effect of all common stock equivalents.         89           Diluted EPS is calculated under the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class method. For the diluted calculation, we increase the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding by the assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock and debentures from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and the number of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options and warrants and the issuance of incentive shares using the treasury stock method. These adjustments to the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding are made only when such adjustments will dilute earnings per common share. See Note 14 for additional information.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Treasury Stock   Treasury stock acquired is recorded at cost and is carried as a reduction of equity in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.   Share-Based Compensation   Share-based compensation cost is recognized as expense for stock options and restricted stock awards issued to employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A binomial option-pricing model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the closing market price of the Companys common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. The costs are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally defined as the vesting period for the awards. When an award is granted to an employee who is retirement eligible or who will become retirement eligible prior to the end of the service period, the compensation cost of these awards is recognized over the period up to the date an employee first becomes eligible to retire. The amortization of share-based compensation reflects estimated forfeitures adjusted for actual forfeiture experience. As compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time share-based awards are exercised, cancelled, expire, or restrictions are released, we may be required to recognize an adjustment to stockholders equity or tax expense, depending on the market price of the Companys stock at that time. Share-based compensation expense is included in salaries and wages in the Consolidated Statements of Income.   For additional details on our share-based compensation plans, refer to Note 16.   Comprehensive Income   Comprehensive income consists of two components, reported net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. GAAP are recorded as an element of equity but are excluded from reported net income. We include changes in unrealized gains or losses on securities available-for-sale, net of tax, in other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.   Preferred Stock   Preferred stock ranks senior to common stock with respect to dividends and has preference in the event of liquidation. The shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock) issued to the United States Treasury (U.S. Treasury) under the TARP Capital Purchase Program (CPP) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the warrants issued under the CPP are accounted for as permanent equity on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The proceeds received were allocated between the Series B Preferred Stock and the warrants based upon their relative fair values as of the date of issuance which resulted in the recording of a discount on the Series B Preferred Stock upon issuance that reflects the value allocated to the warrants. The discount is accreted by a charge to retained earnings using the effective interest method over the expected life of the preferred stock of five years.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Series B Preferred Stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per annum until the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance, and thereafter at a rate of 9% per annum. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears and accrued as earned over the period the Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding. Preferred dividends paid (declared and accrued) and the related accretion is deducted from net income for computing income available to common stockholders and earnings per share computations.    Segment Disclosures   Operating segments are components of a business that (i) engage in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses; (ii) has operating results that are reviewed regularly by the entitys chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the operations of the Company under three operating segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Holding Company Activities. Refer to Note 21 for additional disclosure regarding the performance of our operating segments.           2.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets   On January 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) related to the transfer of financial assets. This guidance removes the exception for qualifying special-purpose entities from consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sale accounting for certain guaranteed mortgage securitizations when a transferor had not surrendered control over the transferred financial assets. The new guidance also establishes         90            conditions for accounting and reporting of a transfer of a portion of a financial asset, modifies the asset sale/derecognition criteria, and changes how retained interests are initially measured. The new guidance is expected to provide greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, with the transferred assets. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position.    Variable Interest Entities   On January 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to variable interest entities. This guidance replaces a quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb its losses or the right to receive its benefits. This guidance requires reconsideration of whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts or circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. It also requires ongoing assessments of whether a variable interest holder is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Fair Value Measurement   On January 1, 2010, we adopted a new accounting standard issued by the FASB providing additional guidance relating to fair value measurement disclosures. Specifically, companies are required to separately disclose significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers. Significance should generally be based on earnings and total assets or liabilities, or when changes are recognized in other comprehensive income, based on total equity. Companies may take different approaches in determining when to recognize such transfers, including using the actual date of the event or change in circumstances causing the transfer, or using the beginning or ending of a reporting period. For Level 3 fair value measurements, the new guidance requires presentation of separate information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements. Additionally, the FASB also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure requirements relating to the level of disaggregation, inputs, and valuation techniques. This accounting standard was effective for us beginning January 1, 2010, except for the detailed Level 3 disclosures, which will be effective beginning January 1, 2011. The adoption of the applicable provisions of the standard on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position as the standard addresses financial statement disclosures only.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Modification of a Loan Included in a Pool Accounted for as a Single Asset   On July 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to modifications of loans that are accounted for within a pool under accounting standards for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality. This guidance states that a modified loan within a pool of purchased, credit-impaired loans that are accounted for as a single asset should remain in the pool even if the modification would otherwise be considered a troubled debt restructuring. The amended guidance continues to require that an entity consider whether the pool of assets in which the loan is included is impaired if expected cash flows for the pool change. No additional disclosures are required as a result of this new guidance and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position.    Disclosures on Loan Credit Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses    On July 21, 2010, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to expanded disclosures for credit quality on financing receivables (such as our originated and covered loan portfolios) and the allowance for credit losses. This guidance requires entities to provide disclosures designed to facilitate financial statement users evaluation of (i) the nature of credit risk inherent in the entitys financing receivables portfolio, (ii) how that risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses and (iii) the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for credit losses. Disclosures must be disaggregated by portfolio segment, the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses, and class of financing receivable, which is generally a disaggregation of portfolio segment. The required disclosures include, among other things, a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses as well as information about modified, impaired, nonaccrual and past due loans and credit quality indicators. This guidance is effective for the Companys financial statements as of December 31, 2010, as it relates to disclosures required as of the end of a reporting period. Disclosures that relate to activity during a reporting period will be required for the Companys financial statements that include periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011. Since the new guidance only affects disclosures, it will not impact our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position. Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 6 for the Companys expanded disclosures.   In January 2010, the FASB temporarily delayed the effective date for the troubled debt restructuring (TDR) disclosures that are required in this guidance. The disclosures will be required when the FASB completes its separate project on identifying TDRs, which is expected in first quarter 2011 with an anticipated effective date for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2011.    Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption   Goodwill Impairment Testing   On December 17, 2010, the FASB issued accounting guidance on when to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. The guidance modifies step one of the goodwill         91            impairment test (assessing whether the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value) for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity will be required to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test (determining whether goodwill is impaired and calculating the amount of the impairment) if it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists. This guidance will be effective for the Companys financial statements that include periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011. As none of our reporting units have a zero or negative carrying amount, the adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2011 did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position.           3.

As a successor to former member subsidiary banks which have merged into our non-member subsidiary bank, The PrivateBank  Chicago is required to maintain this equity security in an amount as required by the FHLB. This equity security is restricted in that it can only be sold back to the FHLB or another member institution at par. Therefore, it is less liquid than other tradable equity securities. The fair value is estimated to be cost, and no other-than-temporary impairments have been recorded on this security during 2010 or 2009.    The carrying value of securities available-for-sale, which were pledged to secure public deposits, trust deposits and for other purposes as permitted or required by law, totaled $656.3 million at December 31, 2010 and $726.8 million at December 31, 2009.   Excluding securities issued or backed by the U.S. Government and its agencies and U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, there were no investments in securities from one issuer that exceeded 10% of consolidated equity at December 31, 2010 or 2009.    The following table presents the aggregate amount of unrealized losses and the aggregate related fair values of securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The securities presented are grouped according to the time periods during which the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position.         92           Securities In Unrealized Loss Position   (Amounts in thousands)                                           Less Than 12 Months        12 Months or Longer         Total             Fair Value         Unrealized Losses        Fair Value         Unrealized Losses         Fair Value         Unrealized Losses        As of December 31, 2010                                              Collateralized mortgage obligations      $  148,643          $  (7,930  )      $              $              $  148,643          $  (7,930  )      Residential mortgage-backed securities         378,211             (7,312  )                                       378,211             (7,312  )      State and municipal         33,710             (534  )                                       33,710             (534  )                                                                                     Total      $  560,564          $  (15,776  )      $              $              $  560,564          $  (15,776  )                                                                                               Less Than 12 Months        12 Months or Longer         Total             Fair Value         Unrealized Losses        Fair Value         Unrealized Losses         Fair Value         Unrealized Losses        As of December 31, 2009                                              Collateralized mortgage obligations      $  3,617          $  (20  )      $              $              $  3,617          $  (20  )      Residential mortgage-backed securities         334,903             (1,595  )                                       334,903             (1,595  )      State and municipal         8,176             (105  )                                       8,176             (105  )                                                                                     Total      $  346,696          $  (1,720  )      $              $              $  346,696          $  (1,720  )                                                                                   There were no securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The unrealized losses reported for collateralized mortgage obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates with the contractual cash flows of these investments guaranteed by either U.S. Government agencies or by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises.    Since the declines in fair value on these securities are attributable to changes in interest rates, and because we do not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2010.

Credit Quality Indicators   The Company has adopted an internal risk rating policy in which each loan is rated for credit quality with a numerical rating of 1 through 8. Loans rated 5 and better (1-5 ratings, inclusive) are credits that exhibit acceptable financial performance, cash flow, and leverage. If any risk exists, we attempt to mitigate inherent credit risk by structure, collateral, monitoring, or other meaningful controls. Credits rated 6 are considered special mention as these credits demonstrate potential weakness and that if left unresolved, may result in deterioration in the Companys credit position and/or the repayment prospects for the credit. Borrowers rated special mention may exhibit adverse operating trends, high leverage, tight liquidity or other credit concerns. Potential problem loans have a risk rating of 7 and are considered inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor, the collateral pledged or guarantors. These loans generally have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that may jeopardize liquidation of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not resolved. Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans risk rated 7 or 8 and have all the weaknesses inherent in a 7 rated potential problem loan with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Special mention, potential problem and nonperforming loans are reviewed at minimum on a quarterly basis, while all other rated credits are reviewed as the situation warrants.             97           Credit Quality Indicators (excluding covered assets)  STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1"> (1)    (Dollars in thousands)                                               As of December 31, 2010        Product Segment      Special Mention         % of Loan STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">Type         Potential Problem STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">Loans         % of Loan STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">Type         Non- Performing STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">Loans         % of Loan STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">Type         Total Loans                 Commercial      $  111,929             2.3          $  173,829             3.5          $  82,146             1.7          $  4,912,877         Commercial real estate         203,073             7.1             260,042             9.1             202,724             7.1             2,858,169         Construction         67,915             12.8             45,119             8.5             33,403             6.3             530,733         Residential real estate         9,962             3.1             15,101             4.7             14,841             4.7             319,146         Home equity         3,757             1.9             11,272             5.7             8,195             4.2             197,179         Personal         2,198             0.7             2,227             0.8             24,571             8.3             296,253                                                                                                      Total      $  398,834             4.4          $  507,590             5.6          $  365,880             4.0          $  9,114,357                                                                                                         (1) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    Refer to Note 6 for a detailed discussion regarding covered assets.         98              5.

COVERED ASSETS    In July 2009, The PrivateBank - Chicago, acquired certain assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits of the former Founders Bank (Founders) from the FDIC. The transaction consisted of approximately $843 million in assets, including $181 million in investments and $592 million in loans. The PrivateBank - Chicago assumed $791 million in liabilities including $767 million in non-brokered deposits and $24 million in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Assets totaling approximately $843 million were purchased at a discount of $54 million. The PrivateBank - Chicago and the FDIC entered into a loss sharing agreement regarding future losses incurred on loans and foreclosed loan collateral existing at the date of acquisition. Under the terms of the loss-sharing agreements, the FDIC generally will assume 80% of the first $173 million of credit losses and 95% of the credit losses in excess of $173 million.   As a result of the loss sharing agreement discussed above, the acquired loans, foreclosed loan collateral and indemnification receivable (representing the fair value of expected reimbursements from the FDIC) are presented in our Consolidated Statement of Condition as covered assets.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance, the purchased loans and related indemnification receivable are recorded at fair value at the date of purchase, and carrying over or creating a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for such loans acquired in a transfer is prohibited. At acquisition, we evaluated purchased loans for impairment in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance and our internal policies. Purchased loans with evidence of credit deterioration at the time of acquisition for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered impaired (purchased impaired loans). All other purchased loans are considered nonimpaired (purchased nonimpaired loans).

Because we are recognizing interest income on each pool of loans, they are all considered to be performing.    All purchased loans and the related indemnification asset were recorded at fair value at date of purchase. The initial valuation of these loans and the related indemnification asset required management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates about how the acquired loans would perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis and independent third-party appraisals. Factors that may significantly affect the initial valuation include, among others, market-based and industry data related to expected changes in interest rates, assumptions related to probability and severity of credit losses, estimated timing of credit losses including the foreclosure and liquidation of collateral, expected prepayment rates, required or anticipated loan modifications, unfunded loan commitments, the specific terms and provisions of any loss share agreements, and specific industry and market conditions that may impact independent third-party appraisals.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On an ongoing basis, the accounting for purchased loans and the related indemnification assets follows applicable authoritative accounting guidance for purchased nonimpaired loans and purchased impaired loans. The amounts that we realize on these loans and the related indemnification asset could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in these financial statements, based upon the timing and amount of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. Our losses on these assets may be mitigated to the extent covered under the specific terms and provisions of any loss share agreements.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">For purchased impaired loans, the excess of cash flows expected at the acquisition date over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method when there is a reasonable expectation about amount and timing of such cash flows. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for covered loan losses, and a reclassification from accretable yield to nonaccretable differences. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a recovery of any previously recorded allowance for covered loans, to the extent applicable, and a reclassification of the difference from nonaccretable to accretable with a positive impact on interest income.    For purchased nonimpaired loans, differences between the purchase price and the unpaid principal balance at the date of acquisition are recorded in interest income over the life of the loan using a constant effective yield method. Decreases in expected cash flows after the purchase date are recognized by recording an additional allowance for loan losses. For purposes of determining the appropriate allowance for loan losses, purchased nonimpaired loans are aggregated based on common risk characteristics, and measured for impairment on the basis of this aggregation. The allowance for covered loan losses is determined in a manner consistent with the Companys policy for its originated loan portfolio. The following table presents changes in the allowance for covered loan losses for the periods presented.         101         Allowance for Covered Loan Losses   (Amounts in thousands)                                           Years Ended December 31,             2010        2009             Purchased Impaired STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">Loans        Purchased Nonimpaired STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">Loans        Total        Purchased Impaired STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">Loans         Purchased Nonimpaired Loans         Total        Balance at beginning of year      $  755         $  2,009         $  2,764         $              $              $             Loans charged-off         (20  )         (6  )         (26  )                                                  Recoveries of loans charged-off         14            2            16                                                                                                                                  Net loan charged-off         (6  )         (4  )         (10  )                                                  Provision for covered loan losses  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(1)         7,852            4,728            12,580            755             2,009             2,764                                                                                      Balance at end of year      $  8,601         $  6,733         $  15,334         $  755          $  2,009          $  2,764                                                                                         (1) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    Includes $2.5 million provision for credit losses recorded in the consolidated statements of income, representing the Companys 20% non-reimbursable portion under the loss share agreement.

At December 31, 2010, we were obligated under certain non-cancelable operating leases for premises and equipment, which expire at various dates through the year 2023. Many of these leases contain renewal options, and certain leases provide options to purchase the leased property during or at the expiration of the lease period at specific prices. Some leases contain escalation clauses calling for rentals to be adjusted for increased real estate taxes and other operating expenses, or proportionately adjusted for increases in the consumer or other price indices. The following summary reflects the future minimum rental payments, by year, required under operating leases that, as of December 31, 2010, have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year.         103         Operating Leases   (Amounts in thousands)                       Total        Year ending December 31,            2011      $  11,039         2012         11,022         2013         11,091         2014         10,971         2015         11,161         2016 and thereafter         62,352                        Total minimum lease payments      $  117,636                                                   Years Ended December 31,             2010         2009         2008        Rental expense charged to operations  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(1)      $  12,293          $  11,493          $  6,710         Rental income from premises leased to others      $  781          $  432          $                (1) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    Including amounts paid under short-term cancelable leases.          8.

Consistent with prior years, the Company has elected to conduct its annual impairment testing as of October 31, 2010. This review of goodwill indicated that the carrying value (including goodwill) of the Banking segment exceeded its estimated fair value. Therefore, a step two analysis was performed for this segment, which indicated that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the Banking segment exceeded the carrying value (including goodwill). Therefore, no impairment charge was recorded. There was no impairment charges recorded in 2010, 2009, or 2008. However, market valuations of financial services companies remain depressed relative to book values due to continuing uncertainty. As a result, management believes it may be necessary to continue to evaluate goodwill for impairment on a more frequent basis depending upon current market conditions, results of operations, and other factors. It is possible that a future conclusion could be reached that all or a portion of the Companys goodwill may be impaired, in which case a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded in earnings. Such a charge, if any, would have no impact on tangible capital and would not affect the Companys well-capitalized designation under FDICIA.    The reduction in goodwill is due to an adjustment for tax benefits associated with the goodwill attributable to Lodestar Investment Counsel, LLC (Lodestar), an investment management firm and partially-owned subsidiary of the Company.   We have other intangible assets capitalized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition in the form of core deposit premiums, client relationships and assembled workforce. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 years to 15 years. We review intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.         104         Other Intangible Assets   (Amounts in thousands)                                           Gross Carrying Amount         Accumulated Amortization         Net Carrying Amount             2010         2009         2010         2009         2010         2009        Core deposit intangible      $  18,093          $  18,093          $  4,098          $  3,084          $  13,995          $  15,009         Client relationships         4,900             4,900             2,168             1,772             2,732             3,128         Assembled workforce         736             736             623             388             113             348                                                                                         Total      $  23,729          $  23,729          $  6,889          $  5,244          $  16,840          $  18,485                                                                                       Additional Information - Other Intangible Assets   (Dollars in thousands)                               Years Ended December 31,             2010         2009         2008        Additions to other intangible assets:                          Core deposit intangible  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(1)      $              $  12,378          $             Client relationships  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(1)      $              $  1,300          $  514         Assembled workforce  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(2)      $              $              $  736              Weighted average remaining life at year end (in years):                          Core deposit intangible         6             7             3         Client relationships         8             9             5         Assembled workforce         1             2             2              Amortization expense      $  1,645          $  1,737          $  1,164            (1) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    The 2009 and 2008 increase was in connection with the 2009 FDIC-assisted acquisition of Founders Bank and a correction in the Companys interest in Lodestar in 2008, respectively.

The Debentures held by the trusts, which totaled $244.8 million, are the sole assets of each trust. Our obligations under the Debentures and related documents, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of the trusts. The guarantee covers the distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of the Trust Preferred Securities, but only to the extent of funds held by the trusts. We have the right to redeem the Debentures in whole or in part, on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. We used the proceeds from the sales of the Debentures for general corporate purposes.    Under current accounting rules, the trusts qualify as variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore ineligible for consolidation. Accordingly, the trusts are not consolidated in our financial statements. The subordinated debentures issued by us to the trust are included in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as long-term debt with the corresponding interest distributions recorded as interest expense. The common shares issued by the trust are included in other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

(2) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    Reflects the coupon rate in effect at December 31, 2010. The coupon rate for the Bloomfield Hills Statutory Trust I is a variable rate and is based on three month LIBOR plus 2.65% with distributions payable quarterly. The coupon rates for the PrivateBancorp Statutory Trusts II and III were fixed for the initial five years from issuance and thereafter at a variable rate based on three-month LIBOR plus 1.71% for Trust II, three-month LIBOR plus 1.50% for Trust III. The coupon rate for the PrivateBancorp Statutory Trust IV is fixed. Distributions for Trusts II, III and IV are payable quarterly. We have the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding five years provided no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity of the debentures. During such extension period, distributions on the trust preferred securities would also be deferred, and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock would be restricted.         108              (3) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the Debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption. Subject to restrictions relating to our participation in the U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program, the Debentures are redeemable in whole or in part prior to maturity at any time after the dates shown in the table, and earlier at our discretion if certain conditions are met, and, in any event, only after we have obtained Federal Reserve approval, if then required under applicable guidelines or regulations. The Federal Reserve has the ability to prevent interest payments on Debentures.           13.  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY    TARP Capital Purchase Program    In January 2009, we issued 243,815 shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock) to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 for proceeds of $243.8 million. Cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are payable at 5% per annum for the first five years and at a rate of 9% per annum thereafter. We are prohibited from paying any dividend with respect to shares of our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid in full on the Series B Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods. The Series B Preferred Stock is non-voting, other than class voting rights on matters that could adversely affect the Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is callable at par after three years. Prior to the end of three years, the Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed with the proceeds from one or more qualified equity offerings of any Tier 1 perpetual preferred or common stock of at least $61.0 million (each a Qualified Equity Offering). The redemption price is equal to the sum of the liquidation amount per share and any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series B preferred Stock. The U.S. Treasury may also transfer the Series B Preferred Stock to a third party at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) requires the U.S. Treasury, subject to consultation with appropriate banking regulators, to permit participants in the CPP to redeem preferred stock issued under the CPP without regard to whether the recipient has completed a Qualified Equity Offering or replaced such funds from any other source, or to any waiting period.   In conjunction with the purchase of the Companys Series B Preferred Stock, the U.S. Treasury received a ten year warrant that entitles it to purchase up to 1,290,026 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $28.35 per share. In December 2009, as a result of the completion of two qualified equity offerings, as provided by the terms of the warrant, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant was reduced by 50% from 1,290,026 to 645,013 shares. The ARRA provides that the U.S. Treasury may liquidate these warrants if we fully redeem the Series B Preferred Stock either as a result of redemption by us at a market price determined under the warrants or sale by the U.S. Treasury to a third party.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Series B Preferred Stock and the warrants issued under the CPP are accounted for as permanent equity on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The allocated carrying values of the Series B Preferred Stock and warrants on the date of issuance (based on their relative fair values) were $236.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively. The Series B Preferred Stock and warrants qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital.   Under the terms of our agreements with the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the CPP, we are not prohibited from increasing quarterly common stock dividends at any time, but are precluded from raising the quarterly dividend above $0.075 per share prior to January 30, 2012. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions resulting from the recent losses we have incurred. We must provide notice to and obtain approval from the FRB before declaring or paying any dividends. Dividends also may be limited as a result of safety and soundness considerations. Our quarterly common stock dividend for each of the four quarters of 2010 was $0.01 per share.    Issuance of Common Stock    There were no public or private offerings of common stock during 2010 other than that issued in connection with our share-based compensation plans.

Issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and Conversion Transactions   In June 2009, we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (1) create a new class of non-voting common stock (the Non-voting Common Stock), and (2) amend and restate the Certificate of Designations of the Companys Series A Junior Non-voting Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) to provide, among other things, that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible only into shares of Non-voting Common Stock. Under the amended terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of Non-voting Common Stock. We issued 1,951,037 shares of Non-voting Common Stock to GTCR upon notice of conversion by GTCR of all of its 1,951.037 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock held and converted by GTCR represented all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock on such date. We also entered into an amendment to our existing Preemptive and Registration Rights Agreement with GTCR pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the newly issued shares of Non-voting Common Stock for resale under the Securities Act of 1933.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE   Basic earnings per common share is calculated using the two-class method to determine income applicable to common stockholders. The two-class method requires undistributed earnings for the period, which represents net income less common and participating security dividends (if applicable) declared or paid, to be allocated between the common and participating security stockholders based upon their respective rights to receive dividends. Participating securities include unvested restricted shares/units that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends. Undistributed net losses are not allocated to unvested restricted shares/units stockholders, as these stockholders do not have a contractual obligation to fund losses incurred by the Company. Income applicable to common stockholders is then divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period.    Diluted earnings per common share takes into consideration common stock equivalents issuable pursuant to convertible debentures, warrants, unexercised stock options and unvested shares/units. Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share in periods in which the effect would reduce the loss per share or increase the income per share (i.e. antidilutive).

Realization of Deferred Tax Assets   Net deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.   As a result of the pre-tax losses incurred during 2008 and 2009, we are in a cumulative pre-tax loss position for financial statement purposes for the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. Under current accounting guidance ,  this represents significant negative evidence in the assessment of whether the deferred tax assets will be realized. However, we have concluded that based on the weight provided by the positive evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 represent the aggregate of federal and state tax assets, although federal taxes represent the primary component of the balance. Taxable income in prior years and reversing deferred taxable income amounts provide sources from which deferred tax assets may be absorbed. Most significantly, however, we have relied on our ability to generate future federal taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences, as the primary source from which deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 will be absorbed.    In making the determination that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized, we considered negative evidence associated with the cumulative book loss position, our past performance in forecasting credit costs as well as continued challenging conditions in the commercial real estate sector.    We also considered the positive evidence associated with (a) taxable income generated in 2009 and 2010; (b) reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods; (c) the decline in the cumulative book loss during 2010 and our expectations regarding 2011;             114          (d) our success in achieving increasing levels of pre-tax, pre-loan loss provision earnings during 2009 and 2010, a core source for future taxable income; (e) our reporting of pre-tax profits in each of the past three quarters and five of the past eight quarters; (f) the concentration of credit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio during the past three years and the relative stability of credit trends in recent quarters; (g) our excess capital position relative to well capitalized regulatory standards and other industry benchmarks; and (h) no history of Federal net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of the 20-year Federal net operating loss carryforward period.    In addition, we also considered both positive and negative evidence associated with the estimated timing of reversals of deferred deductible and deferred taxable items and the level of such net reversal amounts relative to taxable income run rate assumptions in future periods.   Certain of the factors noted above support our expectation of generating future pre-tax book earnings in future periods. We believe this in turn should give rise to taxable income levels (exclusive of reversing temporary differences) that more likely than not would be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Liabilities Associated with Unrecognized Tax Benefits    We file a U.S. federal income tax return and state income tax returns in various states. We are no longer subject to examinations by U.S. federal tax authorities for 2006 and prior years. We are also no longer subject to examinations by certain state departments of revenue for 2005 and prior years.    The Company adopted the provisions of the FASB pronouncement on Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes on January 1, 2007. Prior to 2009, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and accordingly no amounts were recognized and accrued for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Roll Forward of Unrecognized Tax Benefits    (Amounts in thousands)                          Years Ended December 31,             2010        2009        Balance at beginning of year      $   876         $             Additions for tax positions related to current year         86                       Additions for tax positions related to prior years         848            876         Reductions for lapse of statute of limitations         (250  )                    Reductions for settlements with tax authorities         (777  )                                               Balance at end of year      $   783         $  876                                        Interest and penalties, net of tax effect, recognized in income tax expense during the year      $   23         $  68         Interest and penalties, net of tax effect, accrued at year-end  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(1)      $   82         $  68            (1) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    Not included in the unrecognized tax benefits roll forward presented above   As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were $631,000 and $667,000, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions that would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized in future periods. While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months, the Company does not anticipate this change will have a material impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.    Illinois Tax Legislation   In January 2011, the state of Illinois passed legislation that increases the corporate income tax rate from 7.3% to 9.5% (which includes a personal property replacement tax of 2.5%). The change is effective for tax years 2011 through 2014 with the rate declining to 7.75% in 2015 and returning to the pre-2011 rate of 7.3% in 2025. The Companys 2010 statement of condition and results of operations were not affected by this tax rate increase.         115         As a result of this change, the Company currently expects to record a one-time adjustment to reduce income tax expense in the first quarter of 2011 by approximately $2.4 to $3.3 million due to this Illinois tax rate increase. The one-time adjustment relates to the revaluation of the Companys deferred tax asset. Exclusive of this one-time adjustment, the Company expects that its provision for income taxes and effective tax rate will increase in 2011 and subsequent years as a result of this Illinois change. The amount of such increase cannot be reasonably estimated, however, because it is dependent on a number of unknown factors, including the level of pre-tax income.           16.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER BENEFITS    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Share-Based Plans    2007 Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan)   The 2007 Plan was approved by the Board of Directors in 2007 and subsequently approved by stockholders in 2008. The 2007 Plan allows for the issuance of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, equity-based performance stock and units and other cash and stock-based incentives to employees, including officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.   2007 Plan Shares                       December 31, 2010           Number of shares of common stock authorized         5,000,000         Number of authorized shares that may be granted in restricted stock or units         1,500,000         Number of shares of common stock that remain available for grant         3,343,077         Number of shares that remain available for grant as restricted stock or units         816,853       At December 31, 2010, the 2007 Plan remains the Companys only share-based compensation plan which allows for the granting of additional awards. The Company has three inactive plans for which no shares remain available for grant, but have unvested or unexercised awards outstanding at December 31, 2010.    All stock awards granted under the plans have an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date the awards are granted.    Stock options are issued to certain key employees and vest generally from 1 to 5 years based on continuous service. We have issued both incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. All options have a 10-year term.   We may issue common stock with restrictions to certain key employees and non-employee directors. The shares are restricted as to transfer, but are not restricted as to voting rights and generally receive similar dividend payments as stockholders, although in certain cases dividends are not distributed until vesting. The transfer restrictions lapse from 1 to 5 years and are contingent upon continued employment and in certain cases on the satisfaction of specified performance criteria. We also issue restricted stock units which settle in common stock when restrictions lapse. These units are issued on similar terms as restricted common stock but these instruments have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents rather than dividends.   Effective March 31, 2010, the Company began issuing shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan as salary stock to one of its executive officers. This stock is fully vested as of the grant date and the related expense is included in salaries and employee benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The executive officer holding salary stock has all of the rights of a stockholder, including the right to vote and receive dividends. As a condition of receiving the salary stock, the executive officer entered into an agreement with the Company providing that he may not sell or otherwise transfer the shares of salary stock for two years, except in the event of death or disability. During 2010, the Company granted $125,000 of salary stock awards payable semi-monthly and issued, net of tax withholding, 7,053 shares of salary stock at a weighted average issuance price of $12.48.

Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock combined with the implied volatility on the exchange traded stock options that are derived from the value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. The expected dividend yield represents the most recent annual dividend yield as of the date of grant. Management reviews and adjusts the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of an option on a periodic basis to better reflect expected trends.

These awards will be settled in cash and accordingly qualify for liability accounting under current accounting guidance. Unlike equity awards, liability awards are re-measured at fair value at each reporting date until settlement, with the change in value recognized in current period expense. At December 31, 2010, the contractual value totaled $3.4 million. Due to an increase in the value of the put rights based on the contract terms, we recorded a charge to expense related to the put rights totaling $399,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010.   Share-Based Compensation Award Modification    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In connection with our 2010 compensation planning and review process, effective January 28, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors approved amendments to certain previously-granted performance share awards to modify the vesting provisions to provide for time vesting of the awards rather than performance vesting based on certain stock price appreciation targets established in 2007. The performance shares were awarded in late-2007 and 2008 pursuant to our Strategic Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and the 2007 Plan in connection with the recruitment or retention of key employees. Except for the change in vesting conditions, the amendments do not change the number of shares, the vesting schedule, continued service requirements or any other terms or conditions set forth in the original awards. In connection with the award modification, certain performance-vesting stock options granted in 2008 and 2007 to these same award recipients were surrendered and are included in the amount of forfeited stock options in the Stock Option Transaction table presented above.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">A total of 127 employees awards were modified. The incremental cost of this modification was $9.9 million and will be recognized from 2010 through 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $3.3 million, (before forfeitures) in share-based compensation expense in connection with the modification of these awards.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">There were no share-based compensation award modifications in 2009 and 2008.    Savings and Retirement Plan    The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan, The PrivateBancorp, Inc. Savings, Retirement and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the KSOP), which allows employees, at their option, to make contributions up to 75% of compensation on a pre-tax basis and/ or after-tax basis through salary deferrals under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. At the employees direction, employee contributions are invested among a variety of investment alternatives. For employees who have met a one-year service requirement and make voluntary contributions to the KSOP, we contribute an amount equal to $0.50 for each dollar contributed up to 6% of an employees compensation (subject to certain maximum compensation amounts as prescribed in Internal Revenue Service guidance). The KSOP also allows for a discretionary company contribution. The companys matching contribution vests in increments of 20% annually for each year in which 1,000 hours are worked. Although no such contribution was made for 2010, 2009 or 2008, the discretionary component vests in increments of 20% annually over a period of 5 years based on the employees years of service.

The purpose of the Plan is to further our ability to attract and retain high quality executives and non-employee directors. Executive officers who participate in the Plan may elect to defer up to 50% of annual base salary and 100% of annual bonus amounts and directors may elect to defer up to 100% of annual directors fees. While deferred, participants elect at the time amounts are deferred whether amounts are credited with earnings as if they were invested in either a fixed income account with interest credited based on our prime rate (not to exceed 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate) on the cash value of the funds deposited, or in deferred stock units (DSUs) with earnings credited in the form of dividend equivalents to that paid to our common stockholders. Except for an earnings credit on the deferred amounts, we do not provide any contributions or credits to participants under the Plan. At December 31, 2010 and 2009 there were 72,947 and 54,381 DSUs, respectively, in the Plan. At the time of distribution, amounts credited in DSUs are paid in shares of our common stock while amounts credited in the fixed income option are paid in cash. All elections and payments under the Plan are subject to compliance with requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code which may limit elections and require delay in payment of benefits in certain circumstances.           17.  REGULATORY AND CAPITAL MATTERS    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory requirements that impose restrictions on cash, loans or advances, and dividends. The Bank is required to maintain reserves against deposits. Reserves are held either in the form of vault cash or non-interest-bearing balances maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and are based on the average daily balances and statutory reserve ratios prescribed by the type of deposit account.    Cash Restrictions    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(Amounts in thousands)                           December 31,             2010         2009        Reserve balances required to be maintained with the FRB         33,027          $  19,773         Cash and due from banks held as collateral for standby letter of credit services         22,000          $  22,000       Under current FRB regulations, the Bank is limited in the amount they may loan or advance to the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries. Loans or advances to a single subsidiary may not exceed 10% and loans to all subsidiaries may not exceed 20% of the Banks capital stock and surplus, as defined. Loans from the Bank to nonbank subsidiaries and the parent company are also required to meet certain collateral requirements.   Various state banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the parent company by the Bank. Dividend payments by the Bank are subject to regulatory approval and are contingent upon a number of factors including the Banks ability to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, the strength of the Banks balance sheet and its ability to support any projected growth, and the Banks profitability and earnings. No dividends were paid by the Bank to the parent company during 2010 or 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the Bank had no capacity under banking regulations to pay dividends to the parent company as a result of the level of its retained earnings and bad debts as defined for purposes of state law.   Under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank are subject to various capital requirements adopted and administered by the federal banking agencies. These guidelines specify minimum capital ratios calculated in accordance with the definitions in the guidelines, including the leverage ratio which is Tier 1 capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets, and the Tier 1 capital ratio and the total capital ratio each as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories. To satisfy safety and soundness standards, banking institutions are expected to maintain capital levels in excess of the regulatory minimums depending on the risk inherent in the balance sheet, regulatory expectations and the changing risk profile of business activities and plans. At the Bank, primarily due to our recent credit loss experience and levels of non-performing loans, the current minimum capital requirements are ratios of 8.25% Tier 1 leverage and 12.0% total risk-based capital.   As of December 31, 2010, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. As of December 31, 2010, the most recent regulatory notification classified the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes would change the Banks classification for this purpose. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory, and possible discretionary, actions by regulators which, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.    The following table presents the Companys and the Banks measures of capital as of the dates presented, the minimum regulatory capital levels established by the FRB and the capital levels to be considered well capitalized under FDICIA.         120         Summary of Capital Ratios   (Amounts in thousands, except for ratios)                                           Actual        FRB Guidelines for Minimum Regulatory Capital        Regulatory Minimum For Well Capitalized STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1">under FDICIA             Capital         Ratio        Capital         Ratio        Capital         Ratio        As of December 31, 2010:                                             Total risk-based capital:                                             Consolidated      $  1,571,619             14.18  %      $  886,404             8.00  %         na             na         The PrivateBank - Chicago         1,363,054             12.32            na             na         $  1,106,185             10.00  %              Tier 1 risk-based capital:                                             Consolidated         1,335,787             12.06            443,202             4.00            na             na         The PrivateBank - Chicago         1,127,448             10.19            na             na            663,711             6.00                 Tier 1 leverage:                                             Consolidated         1,335,787             10.78            495,873             4.00            na             na         The PrivateBank - Chicago         1,227,448             9.11            na             na            618,774             5.00                 As of December 31, 2009  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(1) :                                             Total risk-based capital:                                             Consolidated      $  1,588,014             14.69  %      $  865,001             8.00  %         na             na         The PrivateBank - Chicago         1,316,059             12.35            na             na         $  1,065,409             10.00         The PrivateBank - Wisconsin         18,602             11.12            na             na            16,729             10.00                 Tier 1 risk-based capital:                                             Consolidated         1,331,738             12.32            432,501             4.00            na             na         The PrivateBank - Chicago         1,061,755             9.97            na             na            639,245             6.00         The PrivateBank - Wisconsin         17,257             10.32            na             na            10,037             6.00                 Tier 1 leverage:                                             Consolidated         1,331,738             11.17            476,784             4.00            na             na         The PrivateBank - Chicago         1,061,755             9.05            na             na            586,428             5.00         The PrivateBank - Wisconsin         17,257             8.43            na             na            10,241             5.00            (1) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    The PrivateBank  Wisconsin, a former bank subsidiary and a national bank, was merged with and into The PrivateBank  Chicago effective as of October 31, 2010.           18.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS   We are an end-user of certain derivative financial instruments which we use to manage our exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We also use these instruments for client accommodation as we make a market in derivatives for our clients.    None of the end-user and client related derivatives have been designated as hedging instruments. Both end-user and client related derivatives are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities, with changes in their fair value recorded in current earnings. Refer to Table A below for the fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross basis as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and where they are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Table B for the related net gains/(losses) recognized during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, and where they are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income.   Derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements as allowed under authoritative accounting guidance.    Derivatives expose us to credit risk measured as replacement cost (current positive mark to market value plus potential future exposure from positive movements in mark to market). Credit risk is managed through our standard underwriting process. Actual exposures are monitored against various types of credit limits established to contain risk within parameters. Additionally, credit risk is managed through the use of collateral and netting agreements.   End-User Derivatives   We enter into derivatives that include commitments to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans. It is our practice to enter into                         121          forward commitments for the future delivery of fixed rate residential mortgage loans when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates on our commitments to fund the loans as well as on our portfolio of mortgage loans held-for-sale. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $42.9 million of interest rate lock commitments and $73.7 million of forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans with rate locks at rates consistent with the lock commitment.    We are also exposed at times to foreign exchange risk as a result of issuing loans in which the principal and interest are settled in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Currently our exposure is to the British pound on $4.4 million of loans and we manage this risk by using currency forward derivatives.    Client Related Derivatives   We offer, through our capital markets group, an extensive range of over-the-counter interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to our clients including but not limited to interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, interest rate options (also referred to as caps, floors, collars, etc.), foreign exchange forwards and options as well as cash products such as foreign exchange spot transactions. When our clients enter into an interest rate or foreign exchange derivative transaction with us, we will generally mitigate our exposure to market risk through the execution of off-setting positions with inter-bank dealer counterparties. This permits the capital markets group to offer customized risk management solutions to our clients. Although transactions originated by capital markets do not expose us to overnight market risk, they do expose us to other risks including counterparty credit, settlement, and operational risk.   To accommodate our loan clients, we occasionally enter into risk participation agreements (RPAs) with counterparty banks to either accept or transfer a portion of the credit risk related to their interest rate derivatives. This allows clients to execute an interest rate derivative with one bank while allowing for distribution of the credit risk among participating members. We have entered into written RPAs in which our counterparty bank accepts a portion of the credit risk associated with a loan clients interest rate derivative in exchange for a fee. We manage this credit risk through our loan underwriting process and when appropriate the RPA is backed by collateral provided by our clients under their loan agreement.    The current payment/performance risk of written RPAs is assessed using internal risk ratings which range from 1 to 8 with the latter representing the highest credit risk. The risk rating is based on several factors including the financial condition of the RPAs underlying derivative counterparty, present economic conditions, performance trends, leverage, and liquidity.    The maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments that we could be required to make under our written risk participation agreements assumes that the underlying derivative counterparty defaults and that the floating interest rate index of the underlying derivative remains at zero percent. In the event that we would have to pay out any amounts under our RPAs, we will seek to recover these from assets that our clients pledged as collateral for the derivative and the related loan.

COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Credit Extension Commitments and Guarantees    In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our clients and to conduct lending activities. These instruments principally include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and variable interest rates tied to the prime rate or LIBOR and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash-flow requirements.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Funding of standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the client to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party and are most often issued in favor of a municipality where construction is taking                 124          place to ensure the borrower adequately completes the construction. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the client and the third party. This type of letter of credit is issued through a correspondent bank on behalf of a client who is involved in an international business activity such as the importing of goods.    In the event of a clients nonperformance, our credit loss exposure is equal to the contractual amount of those commitments. We manage this credit risk in a similar manner to evaluating credit risk in extending loans to clients under our credit policies. We use the same credit policies in making credit commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments, mitigating exposure to credit loss through various collateral requirements. In the event of nonperformance by the clients, we have rights to the underlying collateral, which could include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2010, we had recorded a reserve for unfunded commitments of $8.1 million in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.   The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us under standby letters of credit arrangements are equal to the contractual amount of the commitment. The unamortized fees associated with standby letters of credit, which are included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, totaled $482,000 as of December 31, 2010. We amortize these amounts into income over the commitment period. As of December 31, 2010, standby letters of credit had a remaining weighted-average term of approximately 15 months, with remaining actual lives ranging from less than 1 year to 18 years.    Credit Card Settlement Guarantees    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our third-party vendor issues corporate purchase credit cards on behalf of our commercial clients. The corporate purchase credit cards are issued to employees of our commercial clients at the clients direction and used for payment of business-related expenses. In most circumstances, these cards will be underwritten by our third-party vendor. However, in certain circumstances, we may enter into a recourse agreement, which transfers the credit risk from the third-party vendor to us in the event that the licensee fails to meet its financial payment obligation. In these circumstances, a total exposure amount is established for our corporate client. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us under this third-party settlement guarantee would be $1.5 million at December 31, 2010.    We believe that the estimated amounts of maximum potential future payments are not representative of our actual potential loss given our insignificant historical losses from this third-party settlement guarantee. As of December 31, 2010, we have not recorded any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for this settlement guarantee, and management believes that the probability of any payments under this arrangement is low.   Mortgage Loans Sold with Recourse    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Certain mortgage loans sold have limited recourse provisions. The losses for the year ended December 31, 2010 arising from limited recourse provisions were not material.   Legal Proceedings   On October 22, 2010, a lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against the Company on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock between November 2, 2007 and October 23, 2009. Certain of our current and former executive officers and directors and firms that participated in the underwriting of our June 2008 and May 2009 public offerings of common stock are also named as defendants in the litigation. On January 25, 2011, the City of New Orleans Employees Retirement System and State-Boston Retirement System were together named as the lead plaintiff and an amended complaint was filed on February 18, 2011. The amended complaint alleges various claims of securities law violations against certain of the named defendants relating to disclosures we made during the class period in filings under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs seek class certification, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, and rescission. At this early stage of the litigation, it is not possible to assess the probability of a material adverse outcome or reasonably estimate any potential financial impact of the lawsuit on the Company.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As of December 31, 2010, there were also certain legal proceedings pending against the Company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.         125            20.  ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We measure, monitor, and disclose certain of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis to account for securities available-for-sale, derivative assets, derivative liabilities, other assets, and other liabilities. In addition, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to apply lower-of-cost-or-market accounting to foreclosed real estate and loans held for sale; evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment, including collateral-dependent impaired loans and for disclosure purposes. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, we use various valuation techniques and input assumptions when estimating fair value.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">U.S. GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels based on the reliability of the input assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:                   Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.                  Level 2  Observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.                  Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.    The categorization of where an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.    Valuation Methodology   We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. However, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value. Additionally, the methods used may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.    The following describes the valuation methodologies we use for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, including the general classification of the assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Securities Available-for-Sale   Securities available-for-sale include U.S. Treasury, collateralized mortgage obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities and foreign sovereign debt. Substantially all available-for-sale securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but may be traded in active markets. The fair value of these securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from external pricing services or dealer market participants where trading in an active market exists. In obtaining such data from external pricing services, we have evaluated the methodologies used to develop the fair values in order to determine whether such valuations are representative of an exit price in our principal markets. The principal markets for our securities portfolio are the secondary institutional markets, with an exit price that is predominantly reflective of bid level pricing in those markets. U.S. Treasury securities have been classified in level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Virtually all other remaining securities are classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.   Loans Held for Sale   Loans held for sale (LHFS) represent mortgage loan originations intended to be sold in the secondary market and other loans that management has an active plan to sell. LHFS are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value, which is determined based on a variety of factors, including quoted market rates and our judgment of other relevant market conditions. LHFS are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.    Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans   We do not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, periodically, we record nonrecurring adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurement. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest or principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the original loan agreement are considered impaired. Impaired loans for which repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral requires classification in the fair value hierarchy. We measure the fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans based on the fair value of the collateral securing these loans. Substantially all collateral dependent impaired loans are secured by real estate with the fair value generally determined based upon appraisals performed by a certified or licensed appraiser using inputs such as absorption rates,                                                           126          capitalization rates and comparables. We also consider other factors or recent developments which could result in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals. Accordingly, fair value estimates for collateral-dependent impaired loans are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The carrying value of impaired loans and the related valuation allowance are disclosed in Note 4.   Other Real Estate Owned (OREO)    OREO is valued based on third-party appraisals of each property and our judgment of other relevant market conditions and is classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.    Covered Assets-Foreclosed Real Estate    Covered assets-foreclosed real estate is valued based on third-party appraisals of each property and our judgment of other relevant market conditions and is classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.    Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities   Client-related derivative instruments with positive fair values are reported as an asset and derivative instruments with negative fair value are reported as liabilities and after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. The fair value of client-related derivative assets and liabilities are determined based on the fair market value as quoted by broker-dealers using standardized industry models, third party advisors using standardized industry models, or internally-generated models. Many factors affect derivative values, including the level of interest rates, our credit performance, and our assessment of counterparty nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk assessment is based on our evaluation of credit risk, or if available, on observable external assessments of credit risk. Client-related derivative assets and liabilities are valued based on primarily observable inputs and generally classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 3 derivatives include risk participation agreements and interest rate derivatives, for which nonperformance risk is based on our evaluation of credit risk and the nonperformance risk is significant to the overall fair value of the derivative.   Other Assets and Other Liabilities   Included in other assets and other liabilities are end-user derivative instruments that we use to manage our foreign exchange and interest rate risk. End-user derivative instruments with positive fair value are reported as an asset and end-user derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported as liabilities and after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. The fair value of end-user derivative assets and liabilities are determined based on the fair market value as quoted by broker-dealers using standardized industry models, third party advisors using standardized industry models, or internally generated models based primarily on observable inputs. End-user derivative assets and liabilities are classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

If a change in valuation techniques or input assumptions for an asset or liability occurred between periods, we would consider whether this would result in a transfer between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between level 1 and level 2 of the valuation hierarchy between December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010. In addition, there have been no changes in the valuation techniques and related inputs we used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period.         128         Reconciliation of Beginning and Ending Fair Value For Those   Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   (Amounts in thousands)                                        Year ended December 31:      Balance at Beginning of Period        Total Gains (Losses)         Purchases, Sales, Issuances, and Settlements        Transfers In (Out) of Level 3         Balance at End of Period        Change in Unrealized Losses in Earnings Related to Assets and Liabilities Still Held at End of Period             Included  in Earnings (1)         Included in Other Comprehensive Income                      2010                                                   State and municipal available-for-sale      $  3,615         $              $              $  (3,615  )      $              $             $             Derivative assets         1,468            2,436                            (3,819  )         4,569             4,654            2,391         Derivative (liabilities)         (101  )         170                            (78  )                        (9  )         (165  )               2009                                                   State and municipal available-for-sale      $  3,615         $              $              $             $              $  3,615         $             Derivative assets         9            44                            (114  )         1,529             1,468            44         Derivative (liabilities)         (30  )         75                            (146  )                        (101  )         (75  )         (1) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    Amounts disclosed in this column are included in capital markets products income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.   At December 31, 2010, $743,000 of derivative assets were transferred from level 2 to level 3 of the valuation hierarchy due to a lack of observable market data, as there was deterioration in the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. Also, at December 31, 2010, $805,000 of derivative assets were transferred from level 3 to level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to an improvement in the credit risk of the derivative counterparty.

Estimated Fair Value of Certain Financial Instruments    U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair values of certain financial instruments, both assets and liabilities, on and off-balance sheet, for which it is practical to estimate the fair value. Because the estimated fair values provided herein exclude disclosure of the fair value of certain other financial instruments and all non-financial instruments, any aggregation of the estimated fair value amounts presented would not represent our underlying value. Examples of non-financial instruments having significant value include the future earnings potential of significant customer relationships and the value of Wealth Managements operations and other fee-generating businesses. In addition, other significant assets including property, plant, and equipment and goodwill are not considered financial instruments and, therefore, have not been valued.    Various methodologies and assumptions have been utilized in managements determination of the estimated fair value of our financial instruments, which are detailed below. The fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in time based on relevant market information. Because no market exists for a significant portion of these financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected economic conditions, loss experience, and risk characteristics of the financial instruments. These estimates are subjective, involve uncertainties, and cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.    The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments.    Short-term financial assets and liabilities   For financial instruments with a shorter-term or with no stated maturity, prevailing market rates, and limited credit risk, the carrying amounts approximate fair value. Those financial instruments include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and other short-term investments, accrued interest receivable, and accrued interest payable.    Loans held for sale   The fair value of loans held for sale is based on a variety of factors, including quoted market rates and our judgment of other relevant market conditions.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Securities Available-for-Sale   The fair value of securities is based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.    Non-marketable equity investments   Non-marketable equity investments include FHLB stock and other various equity securities. The carrying value of FHLB stock approximates fair value as the stock is non-marketable, but redeemable at par value. The carrying value of all other equity investments approximates fair value.   Loans   The fair value of loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan. The estimate of maturity is based on our and the industrys historical experience with repayments for each loan classification, modified, as required, by an estimate of the effect of current economic and lending conditions.    Covered assets   Covered assets include the acquired loans and foreclosed loan collateral (including the fair value of expected reimbursements from the FDIC). The fair value of covered assets is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the asset. The estimate of maturity is based on our and the industrys historical experience with repayments for each asset classification, modified, as required, by an estimate of the effect of current economic and lending conditions.         130         Investment in Bank Owned Life Insurance   The fair value of our investment in bank owned life insurance is equal to its cash surrender value.    Deposit liabilities   The fair values disclosed for non-interest bearing demand deposits, savings deposits, interest-bearing deposits, and money market deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The fair value for certificate of deposits and brokered deposits were estimated using present value techniques by discounting the future cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.   Short-term borrowings   The fair value of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances with the remaining maturities of one year or less is estimated by discounting the agreements based on maturities using the rates currently offered for repurchase agreements or borrowings of similar remaining maturities. The carrying amounts of funds purchased and other borrowed funds approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature.    Long-term debt   The fair value of subordinated debt was determined using available market quotes. The fair value of FHLB advances with remaining maturities greater than one year and other long-term debt is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments.    Derivative assets and liabilities   The fair value of derivative instruments are based on the fair market value as quoted by broker-dealers using standardized industry models, third party advisors using standardized industry models, or internally generated models.   Commitments   Given the limited interest rate exposure posed by the commitments outstanding at period-end due to their variable nature, combined with the general short-term nature of the commitment periods entered into, termination clauses provided in the agreements, and the market rate of fees charged, we have deemed the fair value of commitments outstanding to be immaterial.

OPERATING SEGMENTS    We have three primary operating segments: Banking and Wealth Management, each of which are delineated by the products and services that each segment offers, and the Holding Company. The Banking operating segment includes commercial and personal banking services, which includes the services of The PrivateBank Mortgage Company. Commercial banking services are primarily provided to corporations and other business clients and include a wide array of lending and cash management products. Personal banking services offered to individuals, professionals, and entrepreneurs include direct lending and depository services. The Wealth                                                                       131          Management segment includes the activities of our Private Wealth group, including investment management, investment advisory, personal trust and estate administration, custodial and escrow, retirement account administration, and brokerage services. The activities of the third operating segment, the Holding Company, include the direct and indirect ownership of our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries, the issuance of debt and intersegment eliminations.    The accounting policies of the individual operating segments are the same as those of the Company as described in Note 1.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES   A variable interest entity (VIE) is a partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other legal entity that does not have sufficient equity to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whose investors lack one of three characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest. Those characteristics are: (i) the power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity if they occur; and (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, if they occur.    U.S. GAAP requires VIEs to be consolidated by the party that has those characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest (i.e., the primary beneficiary). The following summarizes the VIEs in which we have a significant interest and discusses the accounting treatment applied for the consolidation of the VIEs.    As discussed in Note 12, we sponsor and wholly own 100% of the common equity of four trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities to third party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities solely in debentures issued by the Company. The trusts only assets as of December 31, 2010 were the $244.8 million principal balance of the debentures and the related interest receivable. The trusts meet the definition of a VIE, but the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts and accordingly, the trusts are not consolidated in our financial statements.    We hold certain investments in funds that make investments in accordance with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act. Such investments have a carrying amount of $2.8 million at December 31, 2010 and are included within non-marketable equity investments in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The investments meet the definition of a VIE, but the Company is not the primary beneficiary as we are a limited investor in those investment funds and do not have the power over their investment activities. Accordingly, we will continue to account for our interest in these investments using the cost method. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount plus additional required future capital contributions of $2.9 million as of December 31, 2010.           23.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON   ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Not applicable.    ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    As of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.   Managements Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.    Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 was effective based on the specified criteria.    Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. That report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, is included in this Item under the heading Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.    Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Board of Directors and Shareholders of PrivateBancorp, Inc.    We have audited PrivateBancorp, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). PrivateBancorp, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.         138         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.    In our opinion, PrivateBancorp, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.    We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial condition of PrivateBancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of PrivateBancorp, Inc. and our report dated March 1, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.              /S/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP       Chicago, Illinois     March 1, 2011        139         ITEM 9B.
