ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW           PrivateBancorp was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1989 to serve as the holding company for a Chicago-based de novo (start-up) bank. Our flagship downtown Chicago location opened in 1991. We expanded to Wilmette in north suburban Cook County in 1994 and the Oak Brook facility in west suburban DuPage County was established in 1997. We established the St. Charles office in January 2000, in connection with our purchase of Towne Square Financial Corporation (a company which was in the process of forming a de novo, or start-up bank) on August 3, 1999. On February 11, 2000, we consummated our acquisition of Johnson Bank Illinois adding two additional locations of in Lake Forest and Winnetka, Illinois. During the second quarter 2000, we received regulatory approval to create a new banking subsidiary and on June 23, 2000, PrivateBancorp capitalized The PrivateBank (St. Louis). In May 2001, The PrivateBank (Chicago) opened a second branch in the Fox Valley area in Geneva, Illinois. In December 2002, The PrivateBank and Trust Company acquired a controlling interest in Lodestar Investment Counsel, a Chicago-based investment advisor with $482.0 million of assets under management at December 31, 2002. Lodestar manages equity, balanced, and fixed income accounts primarily for high net-worth individuals, retirement plans and charitable organizations with investable assets in excess of $1.0 million, and shares a similar focus on highly personalized client service.           Since year-end 1995 to December 31, 2002, we have grown our asset base at a compound annual rate of 35% to $1.5 billion. During the same period, loans have grown at a compound annual rate of 34% to $965,600, deposits at a compound annual rate of 32% to $1.2 billion and trust assets under administration at a compound annual rate of 22% to $757.8 million. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) have grown at a compound annual rate of 30% to $1.42 (split-adjusted) since year-end 1995.           For financial information regarding our four separate lines of business, The PrivateBank (Chicago), The PrivateBank (St. Louis), Wealth Management Services and Holding Company Activities, see "Note 2 -- Operating Segments" to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002, included on page F-11.           The profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest-earning assets as compared to the amounts and rates on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset/liability management strategy. The provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio, management's assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio, loss experience, as well as economic and market factors.           Non-interest income consists primarily of net security gains and Wealth Management fee income, and to a lesser extent, fees for ancillary banking services. Non-interest income from fees and deposit service charges are below peer group levels. This is largely the result of the profile of our typical client. Our clients tend to have larger deposit account balances than customers of traditional banks. Because average balances tend to be high, we do not earn high service charge income typical of many retail banks.           Non-interest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations. Our growth directly affects the majority of our expense categories.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES           The Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein. Reference should also be made to our critical accounting policies set out in the notes to consolidated financial statements, beginning on page F-8. Certain critical policies involve estimates and assumptions by management. By their nature, changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect our financial position or results of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgments regarding the determination of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses, as described in both Management's Discussion and Analysis and in the financial statement notes, is of particular significance to us. In addition, effective January 1, 2002, we adopted FAS No. 142, which requires that                                         28    goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested annually for impairment.                         CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET INCOME           Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $11.0 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, compared to $6.2 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2001. Our 2002 earnings per share increased 67% as compared to the prior year earnings per share. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $6.2 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared to $4.4 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2000. Excluding one-time charges, our earnings were $4.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in 2000. Our 2001 earnings per share increased 29% as compared to the prior year earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the 2000 one-time charges. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 included a previously announced one-time charge of $377,000 after-tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, comprised of severance packages for two departing executives as well as amounts incurred to secure their replacements.           The increase in earnings from operations is primarily attributable to growth in the balance sheet, particularly in loans and investment securities, funded by growth in deposits and improvement in our net interest margin. Increased fee income, mainly from income from the sale of residential real estate loans in the secondary market, also contributed to the improvement in income.  NET INTEREST INCOME           Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets and interest expense and amortization of fees on deposits and borrowings. Net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period. Net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings. Interest income includes loan origination fees recorded from loans. Interest expense includes amortization of prepaid fees on brokered deposits and issuance costs of trust preferred securities. The volume of non-interest bearing funds, largely comprised of demand deposits and capital, also affects the net interest margin.           Net interest income was $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $28.0 million for 2001, an increase of 45%. Net interest income is affected by both the volume of assets and liabilities held and the corresponding rates earned and paid. The increase in net interest income for 2002 is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets. Average earning assets for 2002 were $1.3 billion compared to $908.6 million for 2001, an increase of 43%. Our net interest margin was 3.44% for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to 3.27% for the prior year. Increased volumes of interest earning assets at lower rates were offset by reduced interest rates on liabilities. While our cost of funds was significantly less during 2002 than 2001, 2.68% compared to 4.55%, respectively, our loans repriced less quickly, we received 7.61% in loan interest in 2001 compared to 6.12% in 2002. The effect of non-interest bearing funds was 0.19% at December 31, 2002 compared to 0.41% at December 31, 2001.           Net interest income was $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $23.8 million for                                        29    2000, an increase of 17%. Net interest income is affected by both the volume of assets and liabilities held and the corresponding rates earned and paid. The increase in net interest income for 2001 is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets. Average earning assets for 2001 were $908.6 million compared to $671.5 million for 2000, an increase of 35%. Our net interest margin was 3.27% for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to 3.63% for the prior year.           During 2001, we experienced net interest margin pressure as compared to 2000 due to the decrease in market interest rates that occurred throughout 2001. In addition, during 2001 our floating rate assets repriced faster than our deposits and floating rate deposits. Also, we continued to utilize brokered deposit transactions as part of our asset-liability management strategy. These brokered deposits have staggered maturities and provide a lower costing source of funding compared to traditional deposits.           For 2003, we expect our net interest margin to improve if market interest rates increase relative to 2002 levels. Alternatively, if market interest rates decrease, we expect our net interest margin to continue to experience pressure. A changing interest rate environment has an effect on our net interest margin. A large portion of our loan portfolio is based on floating interest rates and will likely reprice faster than our deposits and floating rate borrowings.           The following table presents a summary of our net interest income and related net interest margin, calculated on a tax equivalent basis (dollars in thousands):                                                                           YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                             ----------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             2002                                    2001                                             ------------------------------------    ------------------------------------                                               AVERAGE                                 AVERAGE                                             BALANCE (1)   INTEREST       RATE       BALANCE (1)   INTEREST       RATE                                             -----------  ----------   ----------    -----------  ----------   ----------              Federal funds sold and other short-term  investments ............................   $     2,822   $     126         4.47%   $     4,862  $      244         5.02% Investment securities(2)   Investment securities(taxable) ........       272,076      13,282         4.88%       162,192      10,901         6.68%   Investment securities(non-taxable) ....       119,408       8,768         7.34%        71,315       5,253         7.37% Loans, net of unearned discount(3) ......       858,783      52,560         6.07%       670,235      50,975         7.61%                                             -----------  ----------   ----------    -----------  ----------   ----------   Total earning assets ..................   $ 1,253,089      74,736         5.93%   $   908,605  $   67,373         7.41%                                             ===========  ==========                 ===========  ========== Deposits--interest bearing:   Interest-bearing demand accounts ......   $    57,242  $      636         1.11%   $    44,231  $      923         2.09%   Savings and money market deposits .....       410,522       7,328         1.78%       326,198      11,365         3.48%   Time deposits .........................       537,296      16,014         2.97%       318,510      17,291         5.43%                                             -----------  ----------   ----------    -----------  ----------   Total interest-bearing deposits .......     1,005,060      23,978         2.39%       688,939      29,579         4.29%   Funds borrowed ........................       136,292       5,325         3.85%       120,585       6,327         5.25%   Long term debt -

The provision for loan losses reflects management's latest assessment of the inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Our allowance for probable loan losses is reassessed monthly to determine the appropriate level of the reserve. Our analysis is influenced by the following factors: the volume and quality of loans and commitments in the portfolio, loss experience, and economic conditions. A discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the factors on which provisions are based begins on page 36.           Our provision for loan losses was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $3.2 million for the comparable period in 2001. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $583,000 and net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $981,000. Our provision for loan loss was $1.7 million in 2000 and we recognized $956,000 of net charge-offs during 2000.  NON-INTEREST INCOME           Non-interest income increased slightly, by $26,000 or 0.42%, to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The relatively flat growth in non-interest income in 2002 is attributable primarily to the recognition of net investment securities gains of $11,000 during 2002 which included a charge of $1.0 million related to an other than temporary impairment write-down on the Company's interest-only collateralized mortgage obligation ("CMO") portfolio due to accelerated mortgage prepayments experienced during the second half of the year. The remaining carrying value of the Company's interest-only collateralized mortgage obligation ("CMO") portfolio at December 31, 2002 was $1.1 million. The fair market value adjustment on a previously disclosed $25.0 million 10-year for 3-month LIBOR interest rate swap resulted in trading losses of $943,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Banking service charge income increased by $444,000 over the prior year. Trust fee revenue increased 8% to $2.9 million in 2002 compared to $2.7 million in 2001. Trust assets under administration increased 66% to $1.2 billion at year-end 2002, compared to $722.7 million at December 31, 2001, primarily due to the acquisition of a controlling interest in the assets of Lodestar Investment Counsel. Lodestar's assets under administration at December 31, 2002 were $482.0 million. Trust assets for The PrivateBank (Chicago), not including Lodestar, were $757.9 million at December 31, 2002.                                         31              The following table presents the breakdown of banking, trust services and other income for the periods presented:                                                                      FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                                                  ---------------------------------                                                                     2002        2001        2000                                                                  ---------   ---------   ---------                                                                           (IN THOUSANDS)                      Trust services ...................................   $   2,878   $   2,671   $   2,292             Residential real estate secondary market fees ....       2,248         319          --             Banking and other services .......................       1,354         910         877             BOLI .............................................         601         128          --                                                                  ---------   ---------   ---------             Total banking, trust services & other income......   $   7,081   $   4,028   $   3,169                                                                  =========   =========   =========            Non-interest income increased approximately $2.9 million or 93%, to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $3.2 million for 2000. The increase in non-interest income was attributable primarily to $2.1 million of net gains on the sale of investment securities. Volatility in interest rates during 2001 provided us with the opportunity to sell available-for-sale securities for gains and replace the sold securities with securities that reflect better risk reward parameters and greater return opportunities. Banking service charge income increased by $153,000 over the prior year. Trust fee revenue increased 17% to $2.7 million in 2001 compared to $2.3 million in 2000. Trust assets under administration decreased 7% to $722.7 million at year-end 2001, compared to $777.8 million at December 31, 2000 attributable primarily to declines in equity valuations since the prior year, which was partially offset by increases in new business generated during the year.

The growth in non-interest expense during 2002 represents the continued focus on expansion at the Company. Increases in expenses for salaries and benefits, occupancy, professional services, data processing and insurance reflect the impact of growing our personnel, expanding to new locations and broadening the types of products we offered in 2002.           Non-interest expense increased $4.1 million or 22% to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $18.6 million for 2000. The 2000 results reflect a one-time severance charge of $562,000 relating to severance packages for two departing executives and costs incurred in connection with the recruitment and hiring of their replacements. Excluding one-time charges, non-interest expense increased 26% from $18.0 million during 2000 to $22.7 million during 2001. Increases in expenses for salaries and benefits, occupancy, professional services, data processing and insurance reflect the impact of our personnel growth, the opening of our new banking office in Geneva, and broadening our array of products in 2001. We also incurred charges of $561,000 during 2001 related to the completion of system-related conversions. During 2001, the Lake Forest and the Winnetka offices (formerly known as Johnson Bank Illinois) contributed $3.1 million to operating expenses, including $824,000 of goodwill                                         32    expense. Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 includes operating expenses of $1.2 million and $2.7 million related to the St. Charles and St. Louis offices, respectively.           The following table shows our operating efficiency over the last three years:                                                                                DECEMBER 31,                                                                  ---------------------------------                                                                     2002        2001        2000  (1)                                                                  ---------   ---------   ---------                      Non-interest expense to average assets............        2.17%       2.37%       2.56%             Net overhead ratio(2).............................        1.70        1.73        2.11             Efficiency ratio(3)...............................       57.63       63.17       64.75   - ---------- (1)  Excludes the one-time severance charge incurred in 2000 in the amount of      $562,000. (2)  Non-interest expense less non-interest income divided by average total      assets. (3)  Non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income, on a tax      equivalent basis, plus non-interest income.           Our efficiency ratio (on a tax-equivalent basis), which measures the percentage of net revenue that is expended as non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 improved slightly to 57.6% as compared to an efficiency ratio of 63.2% for the year ended December 31, 2001.           The improvement in our efficiency ratio during 2002 as compared to prior years demonstrates that our business development efforts at our new offices are generating revenue sufficient to offset the related operating expenses. On a tax-equivalent basis, this ratio indicates that during 2002, we spent 57.6 cents to generate each dollar of revenue, compared to 63.2 cents in the prior year. The PrivateBank (St. Louis) became profitable during the fourth quarter of 2001. Our newest location in Geneva is not yet profitable as the costs of business development continued to exceed the related operating expenses in 2002. However, the location has exceeded its growth targets for loans and deposits during 2002. We expect to continue to report improvements in our efficiency ratio as income sources contribute to our profitability in excess of the operating expense growth impact.           Our efficiency ratio for 2000 was negatively impacted due to the start-up nature of the St. Charles office and the St. Louis office. Our St. Charles office first broke even on a monthly basis in July 2000, within one year of the acquisition date.           Salary and employee benefit expense increased 53% to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. During 2002, we added 29 full time equivalent employees to our organization, an increase of 18% to 190 full-time equivalent employees from 160.5 at December 31, 2001. This includes the addition of 14 Managing Directors and Associate Managing Directors.           Salary and employee benefit expense increased 11% to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Full-time equivalent employees increased 17% to 160.5 at December 31, 2001 from 137 at December 31, 2000. The increase in salary and benefits is due primarily to the full effect of the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition, the opening and staffing of The PrivateBank (St. Louis), and the addition of two senior officers responsible for establishing the Geneva office. Our main office in Chicago also experienced personnel growth during 2001.           Professional fees, which include legal, accounting, consulting services and investment management fees, increased 26% to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $2.9 for 2001. The increase between years is primarily due to higher legal, accounting and information-system consultation services as well as consulting services related to the remodeling of four floors at the downtown Chicago location. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the bank also commenced the implementation of a new telephone system. In addition, the increase in wealth management-related business has resulted in increased investment management fees paid to third parties during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.           During 2002, expenditures for information technology totaled $1.9 million, up from $1.1 million at December 31, 2001, representing investments in software and hardware to upgrade the overall information technology infrastructure. The new infrastructure has improved information systems performance as well as strengthened the                                         33    organization's Business Continuity Strategy. The Information Technology Steering Committee, established in 2001, monitored and provided oversight for our information technology strategic plan.           In 2002, we also hired additional Information Technology staff, which has provided greater technical support to the organization and ensured that the new technological infrastructure is fully leveraged. Information technology expenditures will continue in 2003 but are not expected to exceed technology initiatives undertaken during 2002.           The other expense category of non-interest expense consists primarily of postage, telephone, delivery, office supplies, training and other miscellaneous expenses. During 2002 these expenses decreased slightly relative to 2001 by 12%. During 2001 these expenses increased relative to 2000 by 63% due to the continued implementation of our expansion strategy. These expenses have stabilized during 2002.  INCOME TAXES           The following table shows our income before income taxes, applicable income taxes and effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2002 as compared to 2001 reflects the impact of growth in tax-exempt municipal securities. The average balance of municipal securities was $119.4 million, $71.3 million, and $37.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Decreases in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 2000 reflect a higher amount of interest income that was tax exempt in 2001 relative to 2000.                                         34                                   FINANCIAL CONDITION  TOTAL ASSETS           Total assets were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, an increase of $366.6 million, or 31%, from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2001. The balance sheet growth during 2002 was accomplished mainly through loan growth throughout the company and growth in the investment securities portfolio. The growth in assets experienced during 2002 was funded primarily through growth in deposits, including brokered deposits.  LOANS           Total loans increased to $965.6 million at December 31, 2002, an increase of $184.8 or 24%, from $780.8 at December 31, 2001. The primary source of loan growth for 2002 was increased volume in the commercial real estate and construction loan categories. The historically low market interest rates also impacted the increased demand for home equity loans. The PrivateBank (St. Louis) had loans outstanding of $104.7 million as of December 31, 2002, growth of $31.2 million since December 31, 2001. The remaining loan growth of $153.6 million experienced by the Company since December 31, 2001 was generated by the PrivateBank (Chicago).

The amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses, which is charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses, is determined based on a variety of factors, including assessment of the credit risk of the portfolio, delinquent loans, evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area, actual charge-offs during the year and historical loss experience. The unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations, including management's view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses.                                         36             We maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by all available and relevant information. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. We believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio.           The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.20% as of December 31, 2002, compared to 1.06% as of December 31, 2001. Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $583,000 and $981,000, respectively. Net charge-offs to average total loans were 0.07% for 2002 compared to 0.15% for 2001.

Nonaccrual loans are returned to an accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest.           Other than those loans reflected in the table above, we had no significant loans for which the terms had been renegotiated or restructured, or for which there were serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with repayment terms. We did not have any other real estate owned as of any of the dates shown.           Potential Problem Loans. In addition to those loans reflected in the table above, we have identified some loans through our problem loan identification process which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk. Loans in this category include those with characteristics such as past maturity more than 90 days, those that have recent adverse operating cash flow or balance sheet trends, or loans that have general risk characteristics that management believes might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments. The balance in this category at any reporting period can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiations and renewals. The principal amount of loans in this category as of December 31, 2002 was $650,000. At December 31, 2002, there were no significant loans which were classified by any bank regulatory agency that are not included above as nonaccrual, past due or restructured.           Nonaccrual loans were $749,000 as of December 31, 2002 compared to $664,000 at December 31, 2001. Included in nonaccrual loans is a single $430,000 loan relationship at The PrivateBank (Chicago).           Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and accruing loans that are 90 days or more delinquent. Nonperforming loans were $1.4 million as of December 31, 2002, compared to $3.2 million at December 31, 2001. Nonperforming loans were 0.14%, and 0.41% of total loans at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. Nonperforming assets were 0.09% and 0.27% of total assets as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively.                                         37             Loan Concentrations. Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. Other than loans made to borrowers residing in the Chicago and St. Louis metropolitan areas and our involvement in lending secured by real estate, we had no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans at December 31, 2002 or December 31, 2001.  INVESTMENT SECURITIES           Investments are comprised of federal funds sold, debt securities and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. Federal funds sold are overnight investments in which, except for cash reserves, all remaining funds are invested. Our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government agency obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed pools and collateralized mortgage obligations.           All securities are classified as available-for-sale and may be sold as part of our asset/liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with related unrealized net gains or losses, net of deferred income taxes, recorded as an adjustment to equity capital. At December 31, 2002, reported stockholders' equity reflected unrealized securities gains net of tax of $8.8 million. This represented an improvement of $8.5 million from unrealized securities gains net of tax of $323,000 at December 31, 2001.           Securities available-for-sale increased to $487.0 million at December 31, 2002, up 46% from $332.9 million as of December 31, 2001. The growth in the investment security portfolio since December 31, 2001 resulted from the continued implementation of our asset/liability management strategy. The Company held no U.S. government agency obligations in 2002 or 2001. U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increased by $57.0 million from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. Corporate collateralized mortgage obligations decreased by $4.8 million to $18.7 million. The net decrease in collateralized CMO's reflects the write-down of specific CMO's due to accelerated mortgage prepayments experienced during the second half of the year. Tax-exempt municipal securities increased to $134.8 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to the year-end 2001 amount of $106.9 million, an increase of $28.0 million, providing net interest margin protection in a falling interest-rate environment. Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank Stock increased by $62.6 million as a result of purchases made to take advantage of the favorable dividend yield in addition to the liquid nature of the investment. The FHLB can redeem and we can sell, at any time, any FHLB stock we own, in excess of the required minimum of $3.8 million and $5.8 million outstanding as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

required to maintain a ratio of 20:1 of FHLB borrowings to      FHLB stock. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $77.8 million dollars      in advances from the FHLB ($66.3 million from the FHLB of Chicago and $11.5      million from the FHLB of Des Moines, IA). The remaining $151.0 million of      FHLB stock can be redeemed at any time. However, the FHLB may delay the      sale of the stock for up to six months if certain conditions are met.  (2)  The weighted average yield reflects a tax-equivalent adjustment based on a      marginal federal corporate tax rate of 35%.  DEPOSITS AND FUNDS BORROWED           Total deposits of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2002 represented an increase of $354.5 million, or 42%, from $850.5 million as of December 31, 2001. Overall, each deposit category as a percentage of total deposits remained relatively constant in 2002 as compared to 2001, with the exception of continued growth in brokered deposits. During 2002, we continued to utilize brokered deposits as an alternative source of liquidity as compared to traditional core deposits. We expect to continue to rely on brokered deposits in 2003 as a source of liquidity. Non-interest-bearing deposits were $89.0 million as of December 31, 2002, a $15.9 million increase over the $73.1 million reported as of December 31, 2001. Interest-bearing demand deposits increased $12.8 million to $64.9 million at December 31, 2002 compared to $52.1 million at December 31, 2001. Savings and money market deposit accounts increased by $126.0 million to $488.9 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to $363.0 million at December 31, 2001.

In the event that certain of these certificates of deposits are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank, those deposits will be replaced with traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowed money or capital, or we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs.

These amounts      are not deposits and are not insured, but are secured by a pool of      securities pledged specifically for this purpose.           Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System gives us the ability to borrow funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines for short- or long-term purposes under a variety of programs. We have periodically used services of the FHLB for short-term funding needs and other correspondent services.           During 2002, we decreased our use of Federal Home Loan Bank advances to fund loan growth. Management anticipates that our reliance on Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings as a funding source will likely remain at current levels in 2003 to the extent that rates on Federal Home Loan Bank advances continue to be more attractive than deposit pricing. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings totaled $77.8 million at December 31, 2002 compared to $120.4 million at December 31, 2001.                                         42             At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had $3.3 million in FHLB letters of credit outstanding. We pay 0.125% per annum for FHLB letters of credit. The following table shows the maximum availability for and usage of FHLB advances and letters of credit for The PrivateBank (Chicago) and The PrivateBank (St. Louis).                                           MAXIMUM DATE                                   AVAILABILITY       USAGE - ----                                  -------------   -------------                                              (IN THOUSANDS) As of December 31, 2002-   The PrivateBank (Chicago) .......   $      69,072          67,998   The PrivateBank (St. Louis) .....          14,738          11,500  As of December 31, 2001-   The PrivateBank (Chicago) .......   $     109,146   $     108,298   The PrivateBank (St. Louis) .....          16,295          10,500           We accept deposits from a variety of municipal entities. Typically, these municipal entities require that banks pledge marketable securities to collateralize these public deposits. The State of Illinois also accepts FHLB letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had approximately $149.0 million and $166.2 million, respectively, of securities collateralizing such public deposits. Deposits requiring pledged assets are not considered to be core deposits, and the assets that are pledged as collateral for these deposits are not deemed to be liquid assets.           On February 11, 2002, the Company renewed the term on an $18.0 million revolving credit facility with a commercial bank originally entered into on February 11, 2000. On April 11, 2002, the loan agreement was amended and the revolving line was increased to $25.0 million. Effective December 31, 2002, the revolving line was increased to $35.0 million. The interest rate on borrowings under this revolving line resets quarterly, and is based on, at our option, either the lender's prime rate or three-month LIBOR plus 120 basis points with a floor of 3.50%. The Company has elected to pay interest based on the three-month LIBOR rate plus 120 basis points. The initial rate of interest on the revolver was 7.20%, and most recently reset to 3.50% on December 31, 2002. The collateral for this borrowing consists of the common stock of The PrivateBank (Chicago) and The PrivateBank (St. Louis), which is held in custody by the lender. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding balance was $25.0 million.           On February 11, 2000, the Company entered into a subordinated note issued to Johnson International, Inc. and subsequently sold to a third party, in the principal amount of $5.0 million. The interest on the subordinated note is reset each quarter based on the three-month LIBOR rate. The note is payable in full on or before February 11, 2007, and provides for certain rate escalation beginning after February 11, 2002. On February 11, 2002, the interest rate increased from LIBOR +50 basis points to LIBOR +200 basis points. This pricing is in effect until February 11, 2004, at which point the pricing increases to LIBOR +350 until maturity on February 11, 2007. The average rate of interest on the subordinated note was 3.56% during 2002 compared to 4.86% during 2001 and most recently reset to 3.75% on December 31, 2002. The Company has the right to repay the subordinated note at any time after giving at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days advance notice.           On February 8, 2001, we issued $20.0 million in trust preferred securities at a fixed rate of 9.50% which mature on December 31, 2030. At our option, the securities may be redeemed prior to maturity on or after December 31, 2005. The trust preferred securities are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as "Long-term debt-trust preferred securities." Upon receipt of the net proceeds of $18.9 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses and including the underwriters' over-allotment shares, we repaid the full amount of borrowings under a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank in the amount of $18.0 million.  RISK MANAGEMENT           We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities. During 2001, we began to hedge interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management.                                         43    INTEREST RATE RISK           We use a combination of financial instruments, including medium-term and short-term financings and variable-rate debt instruments and, to a lesser extent, interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related cash flows. To manage this mix in a cost-effective manner, in 2001 we entered into our first interest rate swap transaction in which we agreed to receive a fixed rate in exchange for payment of a floating rate based on an agreed-upon notional amount. The fair value of the swap associated with this fair value hedge was $2.9 million on December 31, 2002. As market interest rates continued to decline to historic lows in the second half of 2002, the value of the Company's long-term tax-exempt bank-qualified municipal bond portfolio increased. In order to protect this gain should rates rise, the Company entered into a $25 million swap agreement whereby we sold the 10-year swap and bought 3-month LIBOR to act as an economic hedge to a portion of our long municipal bonds. At December 31, 2002 the market value of the interest rate swap associated with this economic hedge was a liability of $1.1 million. The loss on the swap is recognized in earnings and resulted from declines in market rates of interest since the third quarter 2002.           During 2002, we continued to actively manage our interest rate exposure in our balance sheet. The declines in market rates gave us the opportunity to make changes to our investment security portfolio as part of the implementation of our asset/liability management strategies. Throughout 2002, we continued to replace specific investment securities with alternative investment securities with greater risk reward parameters on a selective basis. The improvements in net interest margin resulting from the improved mix of investment securities coupled with our lower yielding sources of funding offset the yield compression experienced in our loan portfolio, which is more than half floating-rate based.           We have not changed our interest rate risk management strategy from the prior year and do not foresee or expect any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, but we are considering expanding our use of interest rate swaps on our debt obligations in the near future.  CAPITAL RESOURCES           Stockholders' equity at December 31, 2002 rose to $89.1 million, an increase of $26.8 million from the 2001 year-end level of $62.3 million, due primarily to the increase in net income from the year ended December 31, 2002 as well as the increase in the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale net of tax and increases in shares issued.           We are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors, and the regulators can lower classifications in certain areas. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements.           The prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If a banking subsidiary is not "well capitalized," regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited as is asset growth and expansion and plans for capital restoration are required.           The following table reflects various consolidated measures of our capital at December 31, 2002 and 2001:                                                          DECEMBER 31,                                                      -----------------                                                      2002         2001                                                      ----         ----           Leverage ratio..........................   5.47%        6.64%           Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio.........   6.91         8.18           Total risk-based capital ratio..........   8.29         9.71           Total equity to total assets............   5.77         5.29                                         44             As of December 31, 2002, all of the Company's $20.0 million of trust preferred securities are included in Tier 1 capital. The Tier 1 qualifying amount is limited to 25% of Tier 1 capital under Federal Reserve regulations. The entire amount of trust preferred securities qualifies as Tier 1 capital.           A portion of the subordinated note in the amount of $5.0 million that was issued to Johnson International as consideration in connection with the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes.           To be considered "well capitalized," an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. To be "adequately capitalized," an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%. At December 31, 2002, we continued to exceed the minimum levels of all regulatory capital requirements, and were considered "adequately capitalized" under regulatory standards. At December 31, 2002, our total risk-based capital ratio was 8.29%. With the exception of the total risk-based capital ratio, we exceeded the "well-capitalized" levels of our regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2002, The PrivateBank (Chicago) and The PrivateBank (St. Louis) were considered "well-capitalized" under all applicable regulatory standards, including total risk-based capital ratio.  LIQUIDITY           Liquidity measures our ability to meet maturing obligations and our existing commitments, to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels, to fund our operations and to provide for our clients' credit needs. Our liquidity principally depends on our cash flows from our operating activities, investment in and maturity of assets, changes in balances of deposits and borrowings and our ability to borrow funds in the money or capital markets. Liquidity management involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost. Liquidity management is guided by policies, formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks' asset/liability committees, which take into account the marketability of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments. Our principal sources of funds are deposits, short-term borrowings and capital contributions by PrivateBancorp to the banks funded by proceeds from draws on our line of credit or through new capital.           Our core deposits, the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long-term relationships generally established with our clients, are available to provide long-term liquidity. At December 31, 2002, 56% of our total assets were funded by core deposits, even with December 31, 2001 levels. Core deposits are defined to include all deposits including time deposits but excluding brokered deposits and public funds. Time deposits are included as core deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us.           Over the past several years, our clients have chosen to keep the maturities of their deposits short. We expect these short-term certificates of deposit to be renewed on terms and with maturities similar to those currently in place. In the event that certain of these certificates of deposit are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank, unless those deposits are replaced with traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowed money or capital, we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs.           We have continued to use Federal Home Loan Bank advances and brokered deposits as alternative methods of funding loan growth. During 1999, we first utilized brokered deposits as a funding tool to enhance liquidity in anticipation of increasing loan demand. During 2002 and 2001 we expanded our brokered deposits program in order to fund liquidity of The PrivateBank (Chicago). In 2003 we expect to continue to rely on brokered deposits together with increased Federal Home Loan Bank advances as alternative methods of funding loan growth. We will first look toward internally generated deposits as funding sources, but plan to supplement our funding needs with non-traditional funding sources as needed. The PrivateBank (St. Louis) also purchases brokered deposits in the absence of traditional deposit growth sufficient to fund the expected loan growth in that market.           Liquid assets refer to money market assets such as federal funds sold, as well as available-for-sale securities. Net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds. At December 31, 2002, net liquid assets at The PrivateBank (Chicago) were $300.6 million as compared to $240.3 million at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, net liquid assets at The PrivateBank (St. Louis) were $22.1 million as compared to $18.2 million at December 31, 2001.                                         45             Net cash inflows provided by operations were $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to a net inflow of $9.6 million a year earlier. Net cash outflows from investing activities were $338.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to a net cash outflow of $363.0 million a year earlier. Cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $333.0 million compared to a net inflow of $335.7 million in 2001.           In the event of short-term liquidity needs, The PrivateBank (Chicago) and The PrivateBank (St. Louis) may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks. In addition, we currently have available borrowing capacity of $10 million under the $35.0 million credit facility at the holding company. We utilize this credit facility from time to time for general business purposes.  IMPACT OF INFLATION           Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry. Under these principles and practices, we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.           Unlike many industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation.  ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK           As a continuing part of our financial strategy, we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income. This effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield. Asset/liability management policy is established by our board of directors and is monitored by management. Our asset/liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate. These standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations, liquidity, loan limits as a percentage of funding sources, exposure to correspondent banks and brokers, and reliance on non-core deposits. The policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors. The investment policy complements the asset/liability policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities. These criteria include approved types of securities, brokerage sources, terms of investment, quality standards, and diversification.           We measure the impact of interest rate changes on our income statement through the use of gap analysis. The gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods. During any given time period, if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets, a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time. Conversely, a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates.           We have structured the assets and liabilities of our company to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment. We manage our gap position at the one-year horizon. Depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short- and long-term, we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset/liability policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk. Our policy states that we shall maintain a gap position at the one year horizon of between 0.70 and 1.30. Our position at December 31, 2002 was 0.85 and was within the guidelines of our policy. We have continued to maintain our gap position near the low end set by our policy guidelines and expect to continue to operate in this manner as long as the general rate structure of the economy and our business opportunities remain consistent. Therefore, generally speaking, a short-term rise in interest rates will hurt our earnings, while a short-term drop in interest rates would help our earnings.           Interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. There are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement. For example, a rapid drop in interest rates might cause our loans to repay at a more rapid pace and certain mortgage-related investments to prepay more quickly than projected. This could mitigate some of the benefits of falling rates that are expected when negatively gapped. Conversely, a rapid rise in rates could give us an opportunity to increase our margins and stifle the rate of repayment on our mortgage-related loans which would                                         46    increase our returns.           The following tables illustrate the estimated interest rate sensitivity and periodic and cumulative gap positions calculated as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.

The effects are determined through the use of a simulation model based on our earning asset and interest-bearing liability portfolios, assuming the size of these portfolios remains constant from the balance sheet date throughout the one-year measurement period. The simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis. Assets and liabilities then reprice based on their terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period. The model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred.                                                                         DECEMBER 31, 2002             DECEMBER 31, 2001                                                                 ---------------------------   ---------------------------                                                                  +200 BASIS     -200 BASIS     +200 BASIS     -200 BASIS                                                                    POINTS         POINTS         POINTS         POINTS                                                                 ------------   ------------   ------------   ------------          Percentage change in net interest income due to  an immediate 200 basis point change in  interest rates over a one-year time horizon.................            2.9%         -10.5%           3.0%          -4.7%            This table shows that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of -200 basis points on December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, we would suffer a decline in net interest income of -10.5% and -4.7%, respectively over each one-year period. Conversely, a shift of +200 basis points would increase net interest income 2.9% over a one-year horizon based on December 31, 2002 balances, as compared to 3.0% measured on the basis of the December 31, 2001 portfolio.           Changes in the effect on net interest income from a 200 basis point movement at December 31, 2002, compared to December 31, 2001 are due to the timing and nature of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame. Although we are negatively gapped within one year, the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet in the first 90 days of the simulation, coupled with the timing of repricing within the 91 to 365 day bucket, leads to the increase in net interest income from a +200 basis point move. The difference in the effect on net interest income at December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001 is due to the differences in the timing, balances, and current rates versus simulated rates of repricing assets and liabilities.           Management's likely reaction to changes in interest rates is incorporated in assumptions made in these calculations. Differences in these assumptions between the reporting periods have also had the effect of reducing the impact of a changing interest rate environment.           The preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve, prepayments on loans and securities, changes in deposit levels, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others. While our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change.           We continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates. We have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets, sell investment securities, or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk.
