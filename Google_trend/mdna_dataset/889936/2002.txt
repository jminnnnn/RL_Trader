ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  Overview       PrivateBancorp was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1989 to serve as the holding company for a Chicago-based de novo, or start-up, bank. Our flagship downtown Chicago location opened in 1991. We expanded to Wilmette in north suburban Cook County in 1994 and the Oak Brook facility in west suburban DuPage County was established in 1997. We established the St. Charles office in January 2000, in connection with our purchase of Towne Square Financial Corporation (a company which was in the process of forming a de novo bank) on August 3, 1999. On February 11, 2000, we consummated our acquisition of Johnson Bank Illinois adding two additional locations of The PrivateBank (Chicago) in Lake Forest and Winnetka, Illinois. During the second quarter 2000, we received regulatory approval to create a new banking subsidiary and on June 23, 2000, PrivateBancorp capitalized The PrivateBank (St. Louis). In May 2001, The PrivateBank (Chicago) opened a second branch in the Fox Valley area in Geneva, Illinois.       Since year-end 1995 to December 31, 2001, we have grown our asset base at a compound annual rate of 35% to $1.2 billion. During the same period, loans have grown at a compound annual rate of 36% to $780.8 million, deposits at a compound annual rate of 30% to $850.5 million and trust assets under administration at a compound annual rate of 24% to $722.7 million. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) have grown at a compound annual rate of 25% to $1.28 since year-end 1995.       For financial information regarding our four separate lines of business, The PrivateBank (Chicago), The PrivateBank (St. Louis), Wealth Management Services and Holding Company Activities, see "Note 2 -- Operating Segments" to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001, included on page F-10.       The profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest-earning assets as compared to the amounts and rates on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset/liability management strategy. The provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio, management's assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio, loss experience, as well as economic and market factors.       Non-interest income consists primarily of net security gains and wealth management fee income, and to a lesser extent, fees for ancillary banking services. Non-interest income from fees and deposit service charges are below peer group levels. This is largely the result of the profile of our typical client. Our clients tend to have larger deposit account balances than customers of traditional banks. Because average balances tend to be high, we do not earn the high service charge income typical of many retail banks.       Non-interest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations. Our growth directly affects the majority of our expense categories. Profitability and expense ratios were negatively impacted in 2000 due to the start-up operation in St. Charles, the acquisition of Johnson Bank Illinois, and the opening of The PrivateBank (St. Louis). During 2001 we were impacted by the start-up nature of operations in St. Louis, and to a lesser extent, by the new office in Geneva, Illinois. The PrivateBank (St. Louis) began to operate profitably during the fourth quarter of 2001 and will have a positive impact on our profitability in 2002. During 2002 we expect profitability and expense ratios to improve relative to 2001.       The Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein. Reference should also be made to our accounting policies set out in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Certain critical policies involve estimates and assumptions by management. By their nature, changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect our financial position or results of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgments regarding the determination of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses, as described in both Management's Discussion and Analysis and in the financial statement notes, is of particular significance to us. In addition, effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, which requires an annual impairment test of goodwill. Currently, goodwill is recorded at its estimated net realizable value as discussed in Notes 1o. and 1q. to the consolidated financial statements.                                         23                           CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Net Income       Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $6.2 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to $4.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2000. Excluding one-time charges, our earnings were $4.8 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in 2000. Our 2001 earnings per share increased 28% as compared to the prior year earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the 2000 one-time charges. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 included a previously announced one-time charge of $377,000 after-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share, comprised of severance packages for two departing executives as well as amounts incurred to secure their replacements.       Net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $4.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared to $2.9 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 1999. Net income for the year ended December 31, 1999, included an acquisition charge of $1.4 million after-tax, or $0.29 per diluted share, related to the acquisition of Towne Square Financial Corporation in St. Charles, Illinois and the start-up expenses of The PrivateBank (St. Louis). The earnings growth of 7% between 2000 and 1999 is due to growth in net interest income, reflecting higher average loan balances and improvement in net interest margin, and growth in non-interest income mainly from wealth management services, offset by higher operating expenses. Net income in 2000 includes the financial results of the former Johnson Bank Illinois locations subsequent to their acquisition on February 11, 2000. Excluding the effects of goodwill amortization and acquisition interest expense associated with the transaction, the two offices located in Winnetka and Lake Forest contributed $1.0 million to our net income in 2000. Excluding the Towne Square Financial Corporation acquisition-related charge and St. Louis start-up costs, 1999 earnings were $4.5 million. Before these one-time charges, 1999 earnings per diluted share were $1.07.       The tables below show the computation of earnings from operations before one-time charges for 2000 and 1999.

Net Interest Income       Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets and interest expense and amortization of fees on deposits and borrowings. Net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period. Net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings. Interest income includes loan origination fees recorded from loans. Interest expense includes amortization of prepaid fees on brokered deposits and trust preferred securities. The volume of non-interest bearing funds, largely comprised of demand deposits and capital, also affects the net interest margin.                                         24         Net interest income was $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $23.8 million for 2000, an increase of 18%. Net interest income is affected by both the volume of assets and liabilities held and the corresponding rates earned and paid. The increase in net interest income for 2001 is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets. Average earning assets for 2001 were $908.6 million compared to $671.5 million for 2000, an increase of 35%. Our net interest margin was 3.27% for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to 3.63% for the prior year.       A changing interest rate environment has an effect on our net interest margin. A large portion of our loan portfolio is based on floating interest rates and will likely reprice faster than our deposits and floating rate borrowings. During 2001, we experienced net interest margin pressure as compared to 2000 due to the decrease in market interest rates that occurred throughout 2001. In addition, during 2001 our floating rate assets repriced faster than our deposits and floating rate deposits. Also, we continued to utilize brokered deposit transactions as part of our asset liability management strategy. These brokered deposits have staggered maturities and provide a lower costing source of funding. During 2002, we expect our net interest margin to improve if market interest rates increase relative to 2001 levels. Alternatively, if market interest rates decrease, we expect our net interest margin to continue to decrease.       Net interest income was $23.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $15.5 million for 1999, an increase of 54%. The increase in 2000 was primarily attributable to growth in earning assets and, to a lesser extent, improvement in net interest spread. Average earning assets during 2000 were $671.5 million compared to $432.2 million for 1999, an increase of 55%. Our net interest margin was 3.63% for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to 3.79% for the prior year.       Although the rising interest rate environment which was in effect during the first six months of 2000 had the effect of improving the yield on average earning assets during 2000 as compared to 1999, the rates paid on deposits and other borrowed funds also increased in 2000 as compared to 1999, resulting in reduced net interest spread for 2000 as compared to 1999. The decrease in net interest margin is primarily attributable to an increase in borrowed funds utilized to complete the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition and to capitalize the PrivateBank (St. Louis). The effect of non-interest bearing deposits added 61 basis points to 2000 net interest margin.                                         25         The following table presents a summary of our net

The following table shows the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense by major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities attributable to changes in volume or rate or a mix of both, for the periods indicated, calculated on a tax equivalent basis. Volume variances are computed using the change in volume multiplied by the previous year's rate. Rate variances are computed using the changes in rate multiplied by the previous year's volume.

The provision for loan losses reflects management's latest assessment of the inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Our allowance for probable loan losses is reassessed monthly to determine the appropriate level of the reserve. Our analysis is influenced by the following factors: the volume and quality of loans and commitments in the portfolio, loss experience, and economic conditions. A discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the factors on which provisions are based begins on page 31.       Our provision for loan losses was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $1.7 million for the comparable period in 2000. Increases in the provision for loan losses for 2001 as compared to 2000 are related to growth in the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $981,000 and $956,000, respectively. Our provision for loan loss was $1.2 million in 1999 and we recognized $108,000 of net charge-offs during 1999.  Non-interest Income       Non-interest income increased approximately $2.9 million or 93%, to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $3.2 million for 2000. The increase in non-interest income is attributable primarily to $2.1 million of net gains on the sale of investment securities. Volatility in interest rates during 2001 provided us with the opportunity to sell available-for-sale securities for gains and replace the sold securities with securities that reflect better risk reward parameters and greater return opportunities. Banking service charge income increased by $153,000 over the prior year. Wealth management fee revenue increased 17% to $2.7 million in 2001 compared to $2.3 million in 2000. Trust assets under administration decreased 7% to $722.7 million at year-end 2001, compared to $777.8 million at December 31, 2000 attributable primarily to declines in equity valuations since the prior year, which was partially offset by increases in new business generated during the year.       Non-interest income increased approximately $1.2 million, or 58%, to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $2.0 million for 1999. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in service charge income and wealth management fee revenues. Banking service charge income increased by $456,083 over the prior year due primarily to fees earned on accounts related to the former Johnson Bank Illinois offices in Winnetka and Lake Forest. Wealth management fee revenue grew 44% to $2.3 million in 2000, compared to $1.6 million in 1999. In February 2000, the acquisition of Johnson Bank Illinois added approximately $60.0 million to trust assets under administration. During 2000 we expanded our wealth management services beyond the Chicago office with the addition of wealth management staff to our suburban offices.       Total non-interest income also included $92,000, and $57,000 in realized gains from sales of investment securities during 2000 and 1999 respectively.  Non-interest Expense                                                         Year Ended December 31,                                                    -----------------------------                                                     2001       2000       1999                                                    -------    -------    -------                                                             (in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits ................    $ 9,111    $ 8,174    $ 5,156 Severance charge ..............................         --        562         -- Towne Square Financial Corporation      acquisition ..............................         --         --      1,300 Occupancy .....................................      4,158      2,987      1,563 Data processing ...............................      1,295        820        478 Marketing .....................................      1,208      1,202        692 Professional fees .............................      2,939      2,135      1,295 Goodwill ......................................        824        731         -- Insurance .....................................        354        303        214 Other expense .................................      2,763      1,692      1,389                                                    -------    -------    ------- Total non-interest expense ....................    $22,652    $18,606    $12,087                                                    =======    =======    =======       Non-interest expense increased $4.1 million or 22% to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $18.6 million for 2000. The 2000 results reflect a one-time severance charge of $562,000 relating to severance packages for two departing executives and costs incurred in connection with the recruitment and hiring of their replacements. Excluding one-time charges, non-interest expense increased 26% from $18.0 million during 2000 to $22.7 million during 2001.                                         27         The increase in non-interest expense during 2001 is a result of our continued expansion . Increases in expenses for salaries and benefits, occupancy, professional services, data processing and insurance reflect the impact of growing our personnel, the opening of our new banking office in Geneva, and broadening our array of products. We also incurred charges of $561,000 during 2001 related to the completion of system-related conversions.       During 2001, the Lake Forest and the Winnetka offices (formerly known as Johnson Bank Illinois) contributed $3.1 million to operating expenses, including $824,000 of goodwill expense. Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 includes operating expenses of $1.2 million and $2.7 million related to the St. Charles and St. Louis offices, respectively.       Excluding the effect of one-time charges in 2000 and 1999, non-interest expense increased 75% in 2000 to $18.0 million compared to $10.3 million for 1999. Non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets changed from 2.71% in 1999 to 2.64% in 2000 to 2.37% in 2001. Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes operating expenses of $1.1 million and $1.4 million related to the St. Charles and the St. Louis offices, respectively. Additionally, 2000 results reflect the addition of the two new locations acquired through the Johnson Bank Illinois transaction which increased operating expenses by $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 in addition to the $731,000 of goodwill amortization recognized during 2000 in connection with the acquisition. The remaining increase in non-interest expense during 2000 of approximately $2.2 million is due to overall growth in salaries and benefits, professional services and marketing costs at our existing offices. Included in total non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1999, is the one-time $1.3 million charge associated with the acquisition of Towne Square Financial Corporation, as well as $133,200 of transaction costs associated with the acquisition. The $1.3 million non-recurring charge is not tax deductible.       The following table shows our operating efficiency over the last three years:                                                              December 31,                                                        -------------------------                                                         2001    2000(1)  1999(2)                                                        -----    -------  ------- Non-interest expense to average assets .............    2.37%     2.56%    2.32% Net overhead ratio(3) ..............................    1.73      2.11     1.87 Efficiency ratio(4) ................................   63.17     64.75    57.52  - ---------- (1)  Excludes the one-time severance charge incurred in 2000 in the amount of      $562,000.  (2)  Excludes the one-time charges relating to the Towne Square Financial      Corporation acquisition and the St. Louis start-up costs totaling      $1,757,000.  (3)  Non-interest expense less non-interest income divided by average total      assets.  (4)  Non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income, on a tax      equivalent basis, plus non-interest income.       Our efficiency ratio (tax equivalent), which measures the percentage of net revenue that is expended as non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 improved slightly as compared to the efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2000 adjusted to exclude one-time charges. Excluding the effects of one-time charges during 2000 and 1999, our efficiency ratio increased to 65% in 2000 from 58% in 1999.       The slight improvement in our efficiency ratio during 2001 as compared to 2000 demonstrates that our business development efforts at the new offices are generating revenue sufficient to offset the related operating expenses in addition to reflecting the impact of securities net gains in 2001. The PrivateBank (St. Louis) became profitable during the fourth quarter of 2001. Our newest location in Geneva is not yet profitable, but the location has exceeded its growth targets for loans and deposits during 2001. Our efficiency ratio for 2000 was negatively impacted due to the start-up nature of the St. Charles office and the St. Louis office. Our St. Charles office first broke even on a monthly basis in July 2000, approximately within one year of the acquisition date. During 2002, the costs of business development at the Geneva office are expected to exceed the related operating expenses. However, we expect to continue to report improvements in our efficiency ratio as income sources contribute to our profitability in excess of the operating expense growth impact.       Salary and employee benefit expense increased 11% to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Full-time equivalent employees increased 17% to 160.5 at December 31, 2001 from 137 at December 31, 2000. The increase in salary and benefits is due primarily to the full effect of the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition, the opening and staffing of the PrivateBank (St. Louis), and the addition of two senior officers responsible for establishing the Geneva office. Our main office in Chicago has also experienced growth in personnel during 2001 in response to the overall growth of the organization and to increased staffing needs to support a growing public company.       Salary and employee benefit expense increased 59% to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Full-time-equivalent employees increased 50% to 137 at December 31, 2000 from 91.5 at December 31, 1999. The increase in salary and benefits is due primarily to an increased number of employees, including the senior officers, responsible for opening the St. Charles and St. Louis offices, as well as the addition of employees from the                                         28    Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition. Our main office in Chicago also experienced growth in personnel during 2000 in response to the overall growth of the organization and to increased staffing needs to support a public company.       Professional fees, which include legal, accounting, consulting services and investment management fees, increased 38% to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2.1 million for 2000 and $1.3 million for 1999. The increases in 2001 and 2000 were primarily due to higher legal, accounting and information-system consultation services, including the system merger completed in connection with the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition, implementation of a new asset liability management software program and various other projects which relate to general upgrades of our current technology infrastructure. In addition, the increase in trust-related business has resulted in increased investment management fees paid to third parties during the year ended December 31, 2001 in addition to 2000 and 1999.       System related projects are expected to continue in 2002. During 2001, we spent $1.1 million in information technology- related projects as we began the renovation of our information technology infrastructure. During 2002, we plan to invest approximately $2.1 million in our information technology infrastructure. These expenditures will result in new hardware, innovative software, upgrades to our disaster recovery systems and overall integration of our various technology components. During 2001, we began the evaluation and the renovation of our information technology infrastructure. The upgrade to our information technology platform is being undertaken as a result of an independent third-party assessment of our current operating environment, which was conducted during 2000. During 2001, we established an information technology committee that reports to the audit committee of the board of directors. During 2002, this committee will monitor the execution of our information technology plan. We have retained information systems consultants to assist us in the implementation of the upgrades as well as assist us in the augmentation of our current disaster recovery network. The 2002 information technology renovation will augment the technology expenditures that have been made in 2000 and 2001.       The other expense category of non-interest expense consists primarily of postage, telephone, delivery, office supplies, training and other miscellaneous expenses. During 2001 these expenses increased relative to 2000 by 63% due to the continued implementation of our expansion strategy. During 2000 these expenses increased relative to 1999 by 22% due to the new offices that were added to the organization in 2000.  Income Taxes       The following table shows our income before income taxes, applicable income taxes and effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.                                                       Year Ended December 31,                                                  ------------------------------                                                   2001        2000        1999                                                  ------      ------      -----                                                      (dollars in thousands) Income before taxes ........................     $8,251      $6,688      $4,172 Income tax provision .......................      2,051       2,263       1,257 Effective tax rate .........................       24.9%       33.8%       30.1%       The effective income tax rate varies from statutory rates principally due to certain interest income which is tax-exempt for federal or state purposes, and certain expenses which are disallowed for tax purposes. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2001 as compared to 2000 reflects the impact of growth in tax-exempt municipal securities. The average balance of municipal securities was $71.9 million, $37.1 million, and $39.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Increases in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to 1999 reflect a lower amount of interest income which was tax exempt in 2000 relative to 1999. The impact of increased non-taxable income in 1999 was offset by the one-time non-tax deductible special charge related to the Towne Square acquisition.                                         29                                   FINANCIAL CONDITION  Total Assets       Total assets were $1.2 billion at December 31, 2001, an increase of $347.3 million, or 42%, over the $829.5 million at December 31, 2000. The balance sheet growth during 2001 was accomplished mainly through loan growth throughout the company and growth in the investment securities portfolio. The growth in assets experienced during 2001 was funded primarily through growth in deposits, including brokered deposits, and to a lesser extent, through increased borrowings.  Loans       Total loans increased to $780.8 million at December 31, 2001, an increase of $182.1 or 30%, from $598.7 at December 31, 2000. The PrivateBank (St. Louis) had loans outstanding of $73.5 million as of December 31, 2001, growth of $48.3 million since December 31, 2000. The remaining loan growth of $133.7 million experienced by the company since December 31, 2000 was generated by the PrivateBank (Chicago). All of the PrivateBank (Chicago) offices posted strong gains in loan volume during 2001.       The following table sets forth the loan portfolio by category as of December 31 for the previous five fiscal years:                                                  Year Ended December 31,                                2001       2000       1999       1998       1997                              --------   --------   --------   --------   --------                                              (in thousands)            Commercial real estate ...   $310,869   $206,464   $146,368   $ 94,392   $ 55,429 Commercial ...............    163,279    137,343     67,026     46,800     33,862 Residential real estate ..     89,889     85,347     72,972     54,171     56,307 Personal .................     64,411     62,414     57,497     44,094     42,077 Home equity ..............     59,795     46,013     24,396     20,100     20,680 Construction .............     92,528     61,143     29,018     22,408     10,140                              --------   --------   --------   --------   --------     Total loans ..........   $780,771   $598,724   $397,277   $281,965   $218,495                              ========   ========   ========   ========   ========        The following table classifies the loan portfolio, by category, at December 31, 2001, by date at which the loans mature:                                One year   From one to   After five                More than one year                              or less   five years      years       Total      Fixed     Variable(1)                             --------   -----------   ----------   --------   --------   -----------                                                         (in thousands)              Commercial real estate ..   $ 71,087     $166,889     $ 72,893    $310,869   $117,779    $122,003 Commercial ..............     99,083       58,149        6,047     163,279     19,889      44,307 Residential real estate..     13,901       14,421       61,567      89,889     12,276      63,712 Personal ................     53,609        7,041        3,761      64,411      6,243       4,559 Home equity .............     12,669       19,337       27,789      59,795         --      47,126 Construction ............     70,968       17,882        3,678      92,528      1,595      19,965                             --------     --------     --------    --------   --------    --------      Total loans ........   $321,317     $283,719     $175,735    $780,771   $157,782    $301,672                             ========     ========     ========    ========   ========    ========   - ---------- (1)  Includes adjustable rate mortgage products.                                         30    Allowance for Loan Losses       We believe our loan loss experience to date reflects the high credit quality of our loan portfolio.

The amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses which is charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses is determined based on a variety of factors, including assessment of the credit risk of the portfolio, delinquent loans, evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area, actual charge-offs during the year and historical loss experience. The unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations, including management's view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses.                                         31         We maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by all available and relevant information. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. We believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio.       The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.06% as of December 31, 2001, compared to 1.02% as of December 31, 2000. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $981,000 and $956,000, respectively. Net charge-offs to average total loans were 0.15% for 2001 compared to 0.18% for 2000.       The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.14% as of December 31, 1999. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $108,000. Net charge-offs to average total loans was 0.03% for 1999.

Nonaccrual loans are returned to an accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest.       Other than those loans reflected in the table above, we had no significant loans for which the terms had been renegotiated or restructured, or for which there were serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with repayment terms. We did not have any other real estate owned as of any of the dates shown.       Potential Problem Loans. We have identified some loans through our problem loan identification process which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk. Loans in this category include those with characteristics such as past due more than 90 days, those that have recent adverse operating cash flow or balance sheet trends, or loans that have general risk characteristics that management believes might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments. The balance in this category at any reporting period can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiations and renewals. The principal amount of loans in this category as of December 31, 2001 was $2,504,000. Loans past due 90 days or more increased by $1.1 million as of December 31, 2001 as compared to December 31, 2000 levels. The increase reflects the growth in our loan portfolio. We believe that asset quality continues to remain strong as of March 2002. At December 31, 2001, there were no significant loans which were classified by any bank regulatory agency that are not included above as nonaccrual, past due or other real estate owned.       Nonaccrual loans increased to $664,000 as of December 31, 2001 from $24,000 as of December 31, 2000. Nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2001 include a single personal loan that comprised approximately $472,000 of the amount at that date. This loan remains on nonaccrual status.       Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and accruing loans which are 90 days or more delinquent. Nonperforming loans were $3,168,000 as of December 31, 2001, compared to $1,445,000 at December 31, 2000. Nonperforming loans were 0.41%, and 0.24% of total loans at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively. Nonperforming loans were 0.27%                                         32   and 0.17% of total assets as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively.       Loan Concentrations. Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities or located in a specific geographic area that might be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. Other than loans made to borrowers residing in the Chicago and St. Louis metropolitan areas and our involvement in lending secured by real estate, we had no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans at December 31, 2001.  Investment Securities       Investments are comprised of federal funds sold, debt securities and, to a lesser extent, equity investments (primarily FHLB stock). Federal funds sold are overnight investments in which, except for cash reserves, all remaining funds are invested. Our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government agency obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed pools and collateralized mortgage obligations.       All securities are classified as available-for-sale and may be sold as part of our asset/liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with related unrealized net gains or losses, net of deferred income taxes, recorded as an adjustment to equity capital. At December 31, 2001, reported stockholders' equity was increased by unrealized securities gains net of tax of $323,000. This represented an improvement of $441,000 from unrealized securities losses net of tax of $118,000 at December 31, 2000.       Securities available-for-sale increased to $332.9 million at December 31, 2001, up 93% from $172.2 million as of December 31, 2000. The growth in the investment security portfolio since December 31, 2000 resulted from the continued implementation of our asset/liability management strategy. Tax exempt municipal securities increased by $70.3 million, providing net interest margin protection in a falling interest-rate environment. Collateralized mortgage obligations increased $13.3 million in 2001. The net increase in collateralized CMO's reflects sales of specific CMO's that posed a heightened risk of prepayments and accelerated premium amortization in a lower market rate environment. Purchases of new collateralized CMO's have included pools of mortgages with built-in prepayment penalties and a lower risk of accelerated premium amortization. Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank Stock increased by $57.8 million as a result of purchases made to take advantage of the favorable dividend yield in addition to the liquid nature of the investment. The FHLB can redeem and we can sell, at any time, any FHLB stock we own, in excess of the required minimum of $5.8 million and $3.4 million outstanding as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.       U.S. government agency obligations decreased by $4.4 million. We held no U.S. government agency obligations at December 31, 2001. U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increased 20% to $101.4 million at December 31, 2001 from $84.3 million at December 31, 2000. Corporate collateralized mortgage obligations increased by $13.3 million to $23.5 million. Tax-exempt municipal securities increased to $106.9 million at December 31, 2001 as compared to the year-end 2000 amount of $36.6 million.

We expect these short-term certificates of deposit to be renewed on terms and with maturities similar to those currently in place. In the event that certain of these certificates of deposits are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank, those deposits will be replaced with traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowed money or capital, or we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs.       Certain brokered deposited issued by us contain a purchased option to call (redeem) the brokered deposit prior to maturity at a specified date. Upon the issuance of the brokered deposits, we pay a broker commission that is amortized to interest expense over the contractual life of the brokered deposit. The called brokered deposits have been replaced by new brokered deposits at current market rates. The following table summarizes our callable brokered deposits outstanding as of December 31, 2001:                                              Deferred    Amount          Rate    Call Date   Broker Commissions  -----------       ----    ---------   ------------------  $ 9,989,000 (1)   6.25%    1/18/02        $ 36,433   10,000,000 (1)   6.15     2/01/02          49,388    5,000,000 (1)   6.05     2/01/02          25,837    3,008,000 (1)   6.15     2/01/02          15,544    5,000,000 (2)   6.00     3/01/02          43,452   10,000,000 (2)   5.50     3/14/02          59,429    5,000,000 (2)   5.40     3/28/02          28,571  -----------                               --------  $47,997,000                               $258,654  ===========                               ========  - ------------------- (1)  On December 11, 2001, we notified the Depository Trust Company of our      intent to exercise our option to call certificates of deposit totaling      $28.0 million. As a result, the remaining unamortized deferred brokered      commissions are now being amortized through the call date versus the      original maturity date. The application of the accelerated term of the      brokered deposits that were called resulted in amortization of $106,494      which was recorded in interest expense in 2001. The remaining deferred      brokered commissions of $127,202 will be recognized in interest expense      during the first quarter of 2002.  (2)  By the end of the first quarter of 2002, we intend to call these brokered      deposits. The remaining deferred brokered commissions of $131,452 will be      recognized in interest expense during the first quarter of 2002.                                         35         A summary  of all funds  borrowed  and  outstanding  and the rate in effect while such borrowings were outstanding, at the period end, is presented below:                                                                             December 31, Amount                                     Rate    Maturity     2001         2000        1999 - ------                                     ----    --------   --------   ------------   -------                                                             (in thousands)            Borrowing under revolving line of credit      facility ..........................   3.10%   02/11/02   $  5,000     $18,000      $    -- Subordinated note ......................   2.53    02/11/07      5,000       5,000           -- FHLB floating rate advance(1) ..........   6.77    05/01/01         --      10,000           -- FHLB open line advance .................   1.74       daily     25,000          --           -- FHLB fixed advance(2) ..................   6.50    10/23/05     24,886      25,000           -- FHLB fixed advance .....................   6.21    12/05/03     30,000      30,000           -- FHLB fixed advance .....................   6.49    11/13/01         --       2,000           -- FHLB fixed advance .....................   4.30    02/01/02     25,000          --           -- FHLB fixed advance .....................   6.03    01/20/00         --          --       15,000 FHLB fixed advance .....................   5.91    06/21/02        500         500           -- FHLB fixed advance .....................   5.89    12/20/02      1,000       1,000           -- FHLB fixed advance .....................   5.21    01/22/02      1,000          --           -- FHLB fixed advance .....................   5.33    07/22/02      1,000          --           -- FHLB fixed advance .....................   5.02    03/06/02      1,000          --           -- FHLB fixed advance .....................   4.21    05/13/02      1,000          --           -- FHLB fixed advance .....................   2.39    11/12/02      5,000          --           -- Federal funds purchased ................   2.06       daily    103,000       2,700           -- Demand repurchase agreements(3) ........   1.60       daily      3,102       2,679           --                                                               --------     -------      -------      Total funds borrowed ..............                      $231,488     $96,879      $15,000                                                               ========     =======      =======   - ------------ (1)  The rate on this FHLB floating rate advance is set at one-month LIBOR minus      five basis points.  (2)  This FHLB advance is subject to a fair value hedge with an interest rate      swap (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements). The      contractual par amount on the advance is $25.0 million.  (3)  Demand repurchase agreements are a form of retail repurchase agreements      offered to certain clients of The PrivateBank (Chicago). Funds are swept      each business day from the client's demand deposit account. These amounts      are not deposits and are not insured, but are secured by a pool of      securities pledged specifically for this purpose.       Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System gives us the ability to borrow funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines for short- or long-term purposes under a variety of programs. We have periodically used services of the FHLB for short-term funding needs and other correspondent services.       During 2001, we increased our utilization of Federal Home Loan Bank advances to fund loan growth. Management anticipates that our reliance on Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings as a funding source will likely remain at current levels in 2002 to the extent that rates on Federal Home Loan Bank advances continue to be more attractive than deposit pricing. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings totaled $115.4 million at December 31, 2001 compared to $68.5 million at December 31, 2000.       At December 31, 2001, we had $3.3 million in FHLB letters of credit outstanding compared to $20.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2000. We pay 0.125% per annum for FHLB letters of credit. The following table shows the maximum availability for and usage of FHLB advances and letters of credit for The PrivateBank (Chicago) and The PrivateBank (St. Louis).

Typically, these municipal entities require that banks pledge marketable securities to collateralize these public deposits. The State of Illinois also accepts FHLB letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had approximately $166.2 million and $33.7 million, respectively, of securities collateralizing such public deposits. Deposits requiring pledged assets are not considered to be core deposits, and the assets that                                         36    are pledged as collateral for these deposits are not deemed to be liquid assets.       On February 11, 2000, we entered into a new, two-year, $18.0 million revolving credit facility. We borrowed $7.5 million under the line in connection with the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition at an initial rate of 7.20%. During the second quarter 2000, we increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility by approximately $8.0 million in order to capitalize The PrivateBank (St. Louis). During the third and fourth quarters of 2000, we increased our borrowings under the revolving credit facility by approximately $1.75 million and $750,000, respectively, for business operating purposes. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving line resets quarterly, and is based on, at our option, either the lender's prime rate or a 90-day LIBOR-based rate. The interest rate on the revolving line reset to 3.10% on December 27, 2001. Upon issuing $20.0 million of trust preferred securities on February 8, 2001, the Company repaid the $18.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In June 2001, we increased the borrowings on the credit facility to $250,000 and in December 2001, we increased borrowings by $4.8 million for general business purposes. As of December 31, 2001, the outstanding balance was $5.0 million. The Company is currently renegotiating the terms of the revolving credit facility. The original terms of the credit facility are still currently in effect.       We also issued a $5.0 million subordinated note to Johnson International, Inc. as partial payment of the purchase price of the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition. The interest rate on the subordinated note resets each quarter based on the 90-day LIBOR rate. The note is payable in full on or before February 11, 2007, and provides for certain rate escalation beginning after two years. The initial rate of interest on the subordinated note was 6.60% and reset to 3.89% on February 11, 2001.       On February 8, 2001, we issued $20.0 million in trust preferred securities at a fixed rate of 9.50% which mature on December 31, 2030. At our option, the securities may be redeemed prior to maturity on or after December 31, 2005. The trust preferred securities are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as "Long-term debt-trust preferred securities." Upon receipt of the net proceeds of $18.9 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses and including the underwriters' over-allotment shares, we repaid the full amount of borrowings under our revolving line of credit with a commercial bank in the amount of $18.0 million.  Risk Management       We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities. During 2001, we began to hedge this risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes.  Interest Rate Risk       We use a combination of financial instruments, including medium-term and short-term financings and variable-rate debt instruments and, to a lesser extent, interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related cash flows. To manage this mix in a cost-effective manner, in 2001 we entered into our first interest rate swap transaction in which we agreed to receive a fixed rate in exchange for payment of a floating rate based on an agreed-upon notional amount. The fair value of the swap was $1.7 million on December 31, 2001.       During 2001, we actively managed our interest rate exposure in our balance sheet. The declines in market rates gave us the opportunity to make changes to our investment security portfolio as part of the implementation of our asset/liability management strategies. Throughout 2001, we were able to replace specific investment securities with alternative investment securities with greater risk reward parameters. In addition, we took advantage of callable (brokered) deposits which were redeemed and replaced with lower costing brokered deposits. The improvements in net interest margin resulting from the improved mix of investment securities coupled with our lower yielding sources of funding offset the yield compression experienced in our loan portfolio, which is more than half floating-rate based.       We have not changed our interest rate risk management strategy from the prior year and do not foresee or expect any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, but we are considering expanding our use of interest rate swaps on our debt obligations in the near future.  Capital Resources       Stockholders' equity at December 31, 2001 rose to $62.3 million, an increase of $8.1 million from the 2000 year-end level of $54.2 million, due primarily to the increase in net income from the year ended December 31, 2001 as well as the change in the fair value of investment securities classified as available-for-sale net of tax.                                         37         We are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors, and the regulators can lower classifications in certain areas. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements.       The prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If a banking subsidiary is not "well capitalized," regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions, asset growth and expansion are limited and plans for capital restoration are required.       The following table reflects various consolidated measures of our capital at December 31, 2001 and 2000:                                                       December 31,                                                      ------------                                                      2001    2000                                                      ----    ---- Leverage ratio ...................................   6.64%   5.54% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio ..................   8.18    6.47 Total risk-based capital ratio ...................   9.71    8.15 Total equity to total assets .....................   5.29    6.54       As of December 31, 2001, the entire amount of our $20.0 million of trust preferred securities is included in Tier 1 capital. The Tier 1 qualifying amount is limited to 25% of Tier 1 capital under Federal Reserve regulations. The entire amount of trust preferred securities qualifies as Tier 1 capital.       The subordinated note in the amount of $5.0 million that was issued to Johnson International as consideration in connection with the Johnson Bank Illinois acquisition qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes.       To be considered "well capitalized," an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. To be "adequately capitalized," an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%. At December 31, 2001, we continued to exceed the minimum levels of all regulatory capital requirements, and were considered "adequately capitalized" under regulatory standards. At December 31, 2001, our total risk-based capital ratio was 9.71%. With the exception of the total risk-based capital ratio, we exceeded the "well-capitalized" levels of our regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2001, The PrivateBank (Chicago) and The PrivateBank (St. Louis) were considered "well-capitalized" under all applicable regulatory standards, including the total risk-based capital ratio.  Liquidity       Liquidity measures our ability to meet maturing obligations and our existing commitments, to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels, to fund our operations and to provide for our clients' credit needs. Our liquidity principally depends on our cash flows from our operating activities, investment in and maturity of assets, changes in balances of deposits and borrowings and our ability to borrow funds in the money or capital markets. Liquidity management involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost. Liquidity management is guided by policies, formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks' asset/liability committees, which take into account the marketability of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments. Our principal sources of funds are deposits, short-term borrowings and capital contributions by PrivateBancorp to the banks funded by proceeds from draws on our line of credit or through new capital.       Our core deposits, the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long-term relationships generally established with our clients, are available to provide long-term liquidity. At December 31, 2001, 56% of our total assets were funded by core deposits. At December 31, 2000, 71% of our total assets were funded by core deposits. Core deposits are defined to include all deposits including time deposits but excluding brokered deposits and public funds. Time deposits are included as core deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us.       Over the past several years, our clients have chosen to keep the maturities of their deposits short. We expect these short-term certificates of deposit to be renewed on terms and with maturities similar to those currently in place. In the event that certain of these certificates of deposit are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank, unless those deposits are replaced with traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowed money or capital, we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs.                                         38         We have continued to use Federal Home Loan Bank advances and brokered deposits as alternative methods of funding loan growth. During 1999, we first utilized brokered deposits as a funding tool to enhance liquidity in anticipation of increasing loan demand and year 2000 contingency planning. During 2001 we expanded our brokered deposits program in order to fund liquidity of The PrivateBank (Chicago). During 2002 we expect to continue to utilize brokered deposits together with increased Federal Home Loan Bank advances as alternative methods of funding loan growth. We will first look toward internally generated deposits as funding sources, but plan to supplement our funding needs with non-traditional funding sources as needed. The PrivateBank (St. Louis) began to purchase brokered deposits in 2001 as well, in the absence of traditional deposit growth sufficient to fund the expected loan growth in that market.       Liquid assets refer to money market assets such as federal funds sold, available-for-sale securities, FHLB stock, Bank-owned life insurance and loans held for sale. Net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and the Federal Reserve deposit requirements. At December 31, 2001, net liquid assets at The PrivateBank (Chicago) were $240.3 million as compared to $137.1 million at December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2001, net liquid assets at The PrivateBank (St. Louis) were $18.2 million as compared to $1.9 million at December 31, 2000.       Net cash inflows provided by operations were $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to a net inflow of $11.9 million a year earlier. Net cash outflows from investing activities were $363.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to a net cash outflow of $232.3 million a year earlier. Cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $335.7 million compared to a net inflow of $216.7 million in 2000.       In the event of short-term liquidity needs, The PrivateBank (Chicago) and The PrivateBank (St. Louis) may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks. In addition, we currently have available borrowing capacity of $13 million under the $18.0 million credit facility at the holding company. We utilize this credit facility from time to time for general business purposes.  Impact of Inflation       Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry. Under these principles and practices, we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.       Unlike many industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       As a continuing part of our financial strategy, we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income. This effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield. Asset/liability management policy is established by our board of directors and is monitored by management. Our asset/liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate. These standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations, liquidity, loan limits as a percentage of funding sources, exposure to correspondent banks and brokers, and reliance on non-core deposits. The policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors. The investment policy complements the asset/liability policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities. These criteria include approved types of securities, brokerage sources, terms of investment, quality standards, and diversification.       We measure the impact of interest rate changes on our income statement through the use of gap analysis. The gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods. During any given time period, if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets, a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time. Conversely, a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates.       We have structured the assets and liabilities of our company to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment. We manage our gap position at the one-year horizon. Depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short- and long-term, we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset/liability policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk. Our policy states that we shall maintain a gap position at the one year horizon of between 0.70 and 1.30. Our position at December 31, 2001 was 1.09 and was within the guidelines of our policy. We have continued to maintain our gap position near the low end set by our policy guidelines                                         39    and expect to continue to operate in this manner as long as the general rate structure of the economy and our business opportunities remain consistent. Therefore, generally speaking, a short-term rise in interest rates will hurt our earnings, while a short-term drop in interest rates would help our earnings.       Interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. There are other factors which are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement. For example, a rapid drop in interest rates might cause our loans to repay at a more rapid pace and certain mortgage-related investments to prepay more quickly than projected. This could mitigate some of the benefits of falling rates that are expected when negatively gapped. Conversely, a rapid rise in rates could give us an opportunity to increase our margins and stifle the rate of repayment on our mortgage-related loans which would increase our returns.       The following tables illustrate the estimated interest rate sensitivity and periodic and cumulative gap positions calculated as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.

immediate 200 basis point change in interest rates on our earning asset portfolio as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. The effects are determined through the use of a simulation model based on our earning asset and interest-bearing liability portfolios, assuming the size of these portfolios remains constant from the balance sheet date throughout the one-year measurement period. The simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis. Assets and liabilities then reprice based on their terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period. The model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred.                                                                          December 31, 2001              December 31, 2000                                                                   -------------------------      -------------------------                                                                   +200 Basis     -200 Basis      +200 Basis     -200 Basis                                                                     Points          Points         Points          Points                                                                   ----------     ----------      ----------     ----------          Percentage change in net interest income due to      an immediate 200 basis point change in      interest rates over a one-year time horizon...............      3.0%           -4.7%           3.7%          -5.5%        This table shows that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of -200 basis points on December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, we would suffer a decline in net interest income of -4.7% and -5.5%, respectively, over each one-year period. Conversely, a shift of +200 basis points would increase net interest income 3.0% over a one-year horizon based on December 31, 2001 balances, as compared to 3.7% measured on the basis of the December 31, 2000 portfolio.       Changes in the effect on net interest income from a 200 basis point movement at December 31, 2001, compared to December 31, 2000 are due to the timing and nature of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame. Although we are negatively gapped within one year, the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet in the first 90 days of the simulation, coupled with the timing of repricing within the 91 to 365 day bucket, leads to the increase in net interest income from a +200 basis point move. The difference in the effect on net interest income at December 31, 2001 as compared to December 31, 2000 is due to the differences in the timing, balances, and current rates versus simulated rates of repricing assets and liabilities.       Management's likely reaction to changes in interest rates is incorporated in assumptions made in these calculations. Differences in these assumptions between the reporting periods have also had the effect of reducing the impact of a changing interest rate environment.       The preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve, prepayments on loans and securities, changes in deposit levels, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others. While our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change.       We continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates. We have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets, sell investment securities, or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk.
