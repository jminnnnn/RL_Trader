ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OFFINANCIAL CONDITION    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    INTRODUCTION    The following discussion and analysis is intended to addressthe significant factors affecting our Consolidated Statements of Income for the years 2009 through 2011 and Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2010 and 2011. When we use the terms PrivateBancorp, theCompany, we, us, and our, we mean PrivateBancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term the Bank, we are referring to our wholly owned banking subsidiary, ThePrivateBank brand. The following discussion is designed to provide stockholders with a comprehensive review of our operating results and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanyingnotes thereto, and other financial information presented in this Form 10-K.    Unless otherwise stated, all earnings per sharedata included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis.    OVERVIEW   We reported net income available to common stockholders of $30.7 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, an improvement from a net loss of$12.1 million, or $0.17 per diluted share in 2010.    The financial performance of the Company in 2011 reflected our focusedefforts on executing our relationship-based commercial middle market strategy and improving asset quality. This is reflected in $1.4 billion in new client relationships added during the year, $534.6 million growth in our higher-yielding commercialand industrial loan portfolio (an 11% increase from the prior year, the majority of which came from new client relationships) and improved loan mix with the commercial and industrial portfolio representing 60% of total loans at year end 2011compared to 53% at year end 2010. We also saw meaningful improvement in our asset quality metrics across the board, with nonperforming loans and assets declining 29% and 15%, respectively, from year end 2010 as a result of problem asset dispositionsof $387.8 million during 2011, movement of $131.4 million of nonperforming loans to other real estate owned (OREO) during 2011, and moderating nonperforming loan inflows resulting from a reduction in early stage problem loans whichdeclined by $524.4 million, or 58%, at December 31, 2011 compared to the prior year levels. With credit quality improving, the provision for loans losses, excluding covered assets, declined $61.5 million from 2010 levels and we reduced ourallowance for loan losses by $31.2 million from the prior year end.    Total deposits were $10.4 billion at the end of 2011,relatively flat compared to year end 2010. Noninterest-bearing deposits, however, made up 31% of total deposits at the end of 2011, compared to 21% at the end of 2010, reflecting a 44% increase in such deposits from December 31, 2010. Theincrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits is due in part to the current interest rate environment and client desires for greater liquidity.    The shift in the loan mix, improving credit quality, deposit repricing and higher demand deposits helped contribute to a net interest margin of 3.49% for 2011, up 11 basis points from 2010. During 2011,non-interest income and net revenue benefited from successful cross-selling efforts of our fee based products such as capital markets, treasury management and other credit related services to both the new and existing client base.   Although expenses continue to be impacted by higher net foreclosed property costs (due mostly to a higher volume of asset dispositions in2011 and a 42% increase in the OREO balance at the end of 2011 compared to the prior year resulting from continued asset workout efforts) and higher compensation expense, total non-interest expenses for 2011 remained relatively flat at $302.3million compared to the prior year reflecting managements ongoing cost control efforts. Operating profit totaled $206.0 million, up 4% from prior year, and was favorably impacted by higher net revenue and relatively unchanged expense levels.Excluding net securities gains, operating profit increased $14.2 million, or 8%, from 2010.    Please refer to the remainingsections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for greater discussion of the various components of our 2011 performance, statement of condition and liquidity.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income, provision for loan and covered loan losses, non-interest income,and non-interest expense. Net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes inmarket rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset/liability management strategy. The provision for loan and covered loan losses is primarily affected by changes in the loan portfolios composition and performance, theidentification of nonperforming loans, managements       33     assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio, and loss experience, as well as economic and market factors. Non-interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from Trust andInvestments, mortgage banking, capital markets products, treasury management, loan and credit-related fees, and other services charges and fees. Net securities gains/losses, if any, are also included in non-interest income.   Net Interest Income    Net interest income equals the excess of interest income (including discount accretion on covered loans) plus fees earned on interest-earning assets over interest expense incurred on interest-bearingliabilities. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income.    Interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and therate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. The net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread becausenoninterest-bearing sources of funds, principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, also support interest-earning assets.    The accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets are included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    Our accounting and reporting policies conform to U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and general practice within the financial services industry. For purposes of this discussion, net interest income and any ratios or metrics that include net interest income as a component, such as forexample, net interest margin, have been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax-exempt securities to those on taxable interest-earning assets. Although we believe that these non-U.S. GAAPfinancial measures enhance investors understanding of our business and performance, these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to U.S. GAAP. The reconciliation of tax-equivalent net interest income ispresented in the following table.

The table also presents the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for 2011 and 2010,including the tax-equivalent yields on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Table 3 below details variances in income and expense for each of the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearingliabilities and indicates the extent to which such variances are attributable to volume and rate changes. Interest income and yields are presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%, through inclusion of thetax-equivalent adjustment as presented in Table 1 above.       34

the change in each.            (2)      Interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. See Table 1 for a reconciliation of the effect ofthe tax-equivalent adjustment.            (3)      Covered interest-earning assets consist of loans acquired through an FDIC-assisted transaction that are subject to a loss share agreement and therelated indemnification asset. Refer to the section entitled Covered Assets for a detail discussion.    2011 Compared to 2010    For 2011, net interest margin was 3.49%, anincrease of 11 basis points from 3.38% for 2010. The improvement results from a 24 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits and an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, offset partially by a decrease in theyield on the investment portfolio as discussed below. Also, the shift in the mix of the loan portfolio toward higher-yielding commercial loans and some large non-recurring loan fees increased the average interest rate earned on loans by two basispoints. Along with the shift in the mix of the loan portfolio to higher-yielding commercial loans, the level of average nonperforming loans year-over-year was reduced by $59.3 million, mitigating any pricing compression seen within the commercialloan portfolio as well as the $21.1 million reduction in interest income on covered assets from the prior year. The lower interest rate environment negatively impacted the yield on the investment portfolio, resulting in a year-over-year reduction ininterest income on a tax-equivalent basis of $5.0 million, despite the $211.5 million increase in the average balance of total securities.    We do not anticipate significant continued benefit to net interest margin in future periods from downward repricing of deposits. Heightened competition, in the face of limited middle market loan demand,could also pressure loan pricing and loan growth in the near term, although year to date we have been successful in maintaining overall yield on our commercial loan portfolio. This reflects       37     higher lending yields in specialized areas that we have pursued, lower levels of nonperforming loans, and some large nonrecurring loans fees. The reshaping of our loan mix, increases inshort-term interest rates, and further reduction in nonperforming loans may help to mitigate the impact of loan pricing compression on net interest margin in future periods.    In 2011, we initiated the use of interest rate derivatives as part of our asset liability management strategy to hedge interest rate risk in our primarily floating-rate loan portfolio and, depending onmarket conditions, including the slope of the yield curve, we intend to enter into additional interest rate swaps. A description and analysis of our market risk and interest rate sensitivity profile and management policies is included inItem 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of this Form 10-K.    2010 Compared to2009    For 2010, net interest margin was 3.38%, an increase of 32 basis points from 3.06% in 2009. A higher volume ofinterest-earning assets positively impacted interest income by $43.0 million, while a decline in the average rate earned on covered assets and securities had a negative impact of $13.8 million. Despite an increase of $177.0 million on averagenonaccrual loans from 2009 to 2010, the yield on loans, excluding covered assets, improved six basis points from 2009. The increase in loan yields reflects a change in loan mix more heavily weighted to higher-yielding commercial loans thanlower-yielding commercial real estate loans. Lower short-term interest rates and deposit repricing initiatives decreased interest expense by $36.3 million, offset in part by higher interest rates paid on borrowings. While total averageinterest-bearing liabilities increased during 2010, a favorable shift in the mix lowered the amount of higher cost funding and led to a $17.8 million reduction in interest expense due to volume. Increases in net interest margin and interest incomefor 2010 include the benefit of a full year of higher interest earning covered assets from the mid-2009 FDIC-assisted acquisition. Covered asset accretion positively impacted net interest margin by 15 and 13 basis points for the years endedDecember 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.    Provision for loan losses   The provision for loan losses, excluding the provision for covered loans, totaled $130.6 million in 2011, compared to $192.0 million in2010 and $198.9 million in 2009. The provision for loan losses is a function of our allowance for loan loss methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for inherent loan losses after net charge-offs have been deducted. Netcharge-offs were $161.8 million in 2011, compared to $190.9 million in 2010 and $89.9 million in 2009. For further analysis and information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses and analysis of credit quality,see Critical Accounting Policies and Credit Quality Management and Allowance for Loan Losses.    Provision forcovered loan losses    For 2011, we recognized $2.3 million in provision for covered loan losses related to the loanspurchased under the FDIC-assisted transaction loss share agreement, compared to $2.5 million in 2010 and $553,000 in 2009. The provision for covered loan losses represents the 20% portion of expected losses on covered loans not reimbursed by theFDIC. For information regarding the FDIC-assisted transaction, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Covered Assets.       38     Non-interest Income    Non-interest income is derived from a number of sources related to our banking activities, including loan and credit-related fees, the sale of derivative products to clients through our capital marketsgroup, treasury management services, and fees from our Trust and Investments business. The following table presents a break-out of these multiple sources of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Excluding securities gains, non-interest income increased by $11.4 million or 14% to $92.5 million for 2011, compared to $81.1 million for 2010.   Trust and Investments fee revenue declined slightly, by 2%, from 2010 levels. During 2011, we gained momentum in carrying out ourstrategic initiative to retool and enhance our wealth management business and services through the addition and expansion of new and existing clients. However, Trust and Investments fee revenue for 2011 was impacted by certain nonrecurring largerestate fees recognized in the prior year period, lower retail tax preparation fees, lower fees from our land trust business, which was sold in early 2011 and some client attrition. Also, due to the implementation of a new strategic approach toservicing our clients investment portfolios which creates a greater reliance on pooled investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and ETFs, and a reduction in using third party account managers, fees were negatively impacted with a commensuratereduction to investment expenses. In addition, Trust and Investment fee revenue is largely dependent on the composition and valuation of assets under management and administration (AUMA), and for 2011, there were lower comparative valuesof AUMA on the date of fee measurement as compared to the prior year. For approximately 89% of the AUMA portfolio whose fees are generated off the value of the assets as of December 31, 2011, the billing date is the last date of the precedingquarter or month creating fluctuations in the fees recognized during the period which may differ from fluctuations in period-end AUMA. AUMA includes assets held in trusts where we serve as trustee, accounts where we make investment decisions onbehalf of clients, and non-managed assets we hold in custody for clients or for which we receive fees for advisory or brokerage services. Excluding $299.1 million in deposits included in AUMA, we do not include these assets on our ConsolidatedStatements of Financial Condition.    Revenue from our mortgage banking business was lower by $3.5 million, or 34%, from 2010,as the prior year experienced an extended period of lower mortgage interest rates and higher refinancing activity as compared to the current year. Unlike the prior year, in 2011, significant refinancing application volume did not begin until thedrop in interest rates in August. Application volume remained strong until the end of 2011, and as such, we anticipate this positive trend will continue through the first quarter of 2012.   Capital markets products income increased $5.1 million from 2010 and included a $719,000 negative credit valuation adjustment(CVA) compared to a negative CVA of $1.6 million for 2010. The CVA represents the credit component of fair value with regard to both client-based derivatives and the related matched derivatives with interbank dealer counterparties.Exclusive of CVA, capital markets income increased to $20.1 million in 2011 compared to $15.9 million in 2010, and was primarily attributable to increased       39     client interest rate swap fees resulting from both loan originations and renewals, larger margin transactions in the current year, and higher foreign exchange revenue from increased transactionsas part of our clients ongoing business activities, a small number of large transactions and increased volatility in foreign exchange markets. Approximately 32% of the increase in capital markets revenues came from an increased penetration ofour client base. There can be no assurances such increased penetration will continue.    Our treasury management group offers afull range of receivables and payables services in addition to online banking and reporting. These products and services include remote capture, liquidity management and lockbox services which are often linked to non-interest and interest-bearingdeposits. Treasury management income increased $3.0 million, or 18%, from 2010. Revenue growth is closely correlated with acquisition of new middle market lending clients with loan growth, though subject to a three to six month lag ofimplementation. The current year increase reflects ongoing success in cross-selling treasury management services to new and existing commercial clients as well as the full year impact of new clients added during 2010. In addition, during 2011, ourearnings credit rate (the rate applied to balances maintained in the clients deposit account to offset activity charges) remained in-line with market and deposit interest rates, declining slightly during the year and providing a smallcontribution to the overall increase in fees.    Loan and credit related fees include income generated from letters of credit,unused commitments, loan syndications and various non-yield loan fees. Loan and credit related fees increased $5.7 million, or 34%, from the prior year and is principally due to a higher volume of syndication revenue driven by increased lead agencycredits as we leveraged our reputation for execution and expended distribution network. Letter of credit and unused commitment fees were also higher in the current year.    Certain fee revenue is earned contemporaneously with or shortly after successfully generating new client relationships and related loans. However, we also expect additional fee revenue from those newclients over time as we penetrate deeper within those relationships and execute upon our cross-sell strategy. Given the more than $1.4 billion in new client relationships during 2011, as well as the mix of our loan portfolio being predominatelycommercial (60% of our total loans as of December 31, 2011 were commercial), which we believe provides the most cross-sell opportunity, we may see additional fee revenues from these new clients in the future.   Other income, service charges, and fees increased $1.5 million, or 29%, from 2010. The increase was primarily due to $938,000 in gains onvarious asset dispositions in 2011, including the sale of our land trust business earlier in the year, as well as $564,000 in losses in the prior year on loans held for sale.    Net securities gains totaled $5.8 million for 2011, compared to $12.2 million for the prior year. During 2011, we sold $290.1 million of securities, which included $188.8 million of collateralizedmortgage obligations, $66.0 million of residential mortgage-backed securities, $15.8 million in U.S. Agencies, and $19.5 million of state and municipal securities. The sales assisted in managing prepayment risk and provided a measure of benefit toour capital position. We frequently evaluate our securities and from time to time may take advantage of what we perceive to be pricing opportunities in the market for specific investments.   2010 Compared to 2009    Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $93.2 million, an increase of $21.8 million, or 30%, from $71.5 million in 2009, reflecting continued success in penetrating andcross-selling targeted middle market commercial relationships. Our total fee revenue for 2010 was $81.1 million, an increase of $16.0 million, or 25%, from $65.1 million in 2009.   Treasury management income increased $6.8 million, or 67%, from 2009. This increase was attributable to improved capabilities in offeringa broader suite of products and services to new and existing clients and increasing penetration in our clients transaction-based activities.    Trust and Investments income increased $2.7 million, or 17%, from 2009 and was attributable to increases in the value of AUMA, in part due to improved equity and fixed income market performance. TotalAUMA totaled $4.0 billion, increasing by $288.0 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2009 to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2010.    Mortgage banking income increased $1.3 million, or 14%, from 2009, reflecting the broader industry trend of increased refinancing based on the low interest rate environment that prevailed during 2010.   Capital markets income decreased $2.9 million, or 17%, from 2009. Of the $2.9 million decrease, $2.4 million representschanges in the credit valuation adjustment, with an $838,000 positive CVA in 2009 and a negative $1.6 million CVA in 2010. Exclusive of CVA adjustments, capital markets income decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting the reduced client demand forinterest-rate derivatives, offset by a $1.9 million increase in foreign exchange revenues, resulting from our implementation of enhanced client interface tools to improve our foreign exchange product offering.       40     Loan and credit related fees increased $3.6 million, or 28%, from the prior year principallydue to new commercial loan originations and increased cross-sell penetration which drove a $2.9 million of growth in unused commitment, loan, and letter of credit fees from the prior year.   Other income, service charges, and fees totaled $5.0 million for 2010, compared to $499,000 for 2009. The increase was primarily due to a$3.6 million decrease in losses on loans held for sale from the prior year, which totaled $564,000 in 2010 and $4.2 million in 2009.    Net securities gains increased $4.8 million, or 65%, from 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we took advantage of market conditions to sell $432.9 million of securities, resulting in anet gain of $12.2 million. In contrast, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold $265.8 million of securities, resulting in a net gain of $7.4 million.

The efficiency ratio ispresented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. See Table 33, Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures, for a reconciliation of the effect of the tax-equivalent adjustment.   2011 Compared to 2010    Non-interest expense totaled $302.3 million for 2011, increasing modestly by $2.7 million, or 1%, from $299.6 million in 2010. Despite continued elevated credit costs, expenses remained relatively flatyear-over-year, reflecting ongoing cost control management.       41     Compensation expense increased overall by $6.9 million, or 5%, from 2010. Salary and wageswere up 3% largely due to annual merit, promotional and market adjustments, slightly offset by a small decline in the number of employees, as well as lower deferred salary costs related to origination expenses on a comparative basis. Share-basedpayment costs were down $1.3 million primarily due to a higher level of forfeiture-related expense reversals on departed and retiring plan participants during 2011. Incentive compensation, retirement costs and other employee benefits were up by $5.2million compared to 2010, reflecting higher incentive compensation expense in conjunction with the improved financial results of the Company. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impact on current year incentive compensation expenseand accruals of the implementation of a new plan feature requiring a portion of the current year bonus for certain employees to be deferred over a future defined service period.   Technology and related costs increased $1.2 million, or 11%, from 2010 due to various systems upgrades occurring during 2011 includingour items processing platform and our data network.    Professional services expense, which includes fees paid for legal,accounting, and consulting services, decreased $3.7 million, or 29%, from 2010. The decrease is primarily due to higher prior year costs relating to risk management consultants, system conversion fees in connection with the integration of theFDIC-assisted acquisition of the former Founders Bank, and audit fees.    Net foreclosed property expense, which includeswrite-downs on foreclosed properties, gains and losses on sales of foreclosed properties, taxes, and other expenses associated with the maintenance of OREO, increased $12.6 million, or 83%, from 2010. The increase in net foreclosed property expensesis primarily due to higher net losses on the sale of OREO resulting from the accelerated pace of sales, as well as the $37.0 million increase in OREO balances during 2011 due to the rate of nonperforming loan workouts surpassing asset dispositionsand higher valuation write-downs resulting from updated appraisals during 2011 as compared to 2010. In 2011, we incurred $9.1 million in net losses on sale of OREO compared to $1.4 million in 2010. Also, OREO write-downs totaled $15.4 million for2011 compared to $6.6 million for the prior year. While the balance of nonperforming loans has steadily decreased throughout 2011, they were $259.9 million at year end. As a result of this and current OREO balances, we expect net foreclosed propertyexpense to remain at elevated levels as we actively resolve problem loans and liquidate OREO. In evaluating to sell OREO, we seek to maximize our ultimate net recovery. The timing of dispositions will depend on a number of factors, including thepace and timing of the overall recovery of the economy, activity and pricing levels in the real estate market and real estate inventory coming onto the market for sale.    Insurance expense decreased $5.2 million, or 20%, from 2010, primarily due to lower deposit insurance assessments as a result of the change in FDIC insurance assessment methodology. In February 2011, theFDIC adopted final rules amending the deposit insurance assessment regulations, modifying, among other provisions, the assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to one based on total assets less average tangible equity. The final rulestook effect April 1, 2011, impacting assessments beginning in the second quarter 2011.    Loan and collection expense,which consists of certain non-reimbursable costs associated with performing loan activities and loan remediation costs of problem and nonperforming loans, decreased $1.1 million, or 7%, from 2010 largely due to a lower level of performing loan costslargely attributable to reduced refinance volumes on a comparative basis. Overall levels remain elevated given the magnitude of problem asset remediation expense.   Other expenses decreased $8.7 million, or 43%, from the prior year. Other expenses include various categories such asbank charges, costs associated with the CDARS ®  product offering, education-related costs, subscriptions,provisions for unfunded commitments and miscellaneous losses and expenses. The decrease was primarily due to an $842,000 reduction of the reserve for unfunded commitments in 2011, compared to a provision for unfunded commitments of $6.7 millionrecorded in 2010, as the clients average credit quality has improved, while at the same time the level of propensity to fund was also lower in the current economic environment. In addition, decreased volume and rates reduced CDARS®servicing fees by $643,000 from the prior year.    2010 Compared to 2009   Non-interest expense increased $52.2 million, or 21%, from 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense, anincrease in net foreclosed property and loan and collection expenses related to credit deterioration, and a higher provision for unfunded commitments as compared to the prior year.   Compensation expense increased $26.2 million, or 21%, from 2009 and is largely attributable to higher annual incentive compensation, ahigher level of average FTEs as a result of the FDIC-assisted transaction in mid-2009, and increases in commission-based compensation. Incentive compensation expense was higher in 2010, as the prior year did not include any significant level ofbonus expense due to the loss from continuing operations reported in 2009.       42     Net occupancy expense increased $3.8 million, or 14%, from 2009. The increase in netoccupancy expense from the prior year reflects $920,000 in additional facility rental expense, $1.4 million in increased depreciation expense, and $802,000 in increased maintenance contract expense related to additional offices acquired in theFDIC-assisted transaction, as well as our increased office space.    Professional services, which includes fees paid for legal,accounting, and consulting services, decreased $3.4 million, or 21%, from 2009. The decrease from the prior year relates in part to non-recurring expenses incurred in 2009 in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction and subsequent integrationactivities.    Net foreclosed property expense, which includes write-downs on foreclosed properties, gains and losses on salesof foreclosed properties, and other expenses associated with the foreclosure process and maintenance of OREO, increased $9.5 million from 2009. The increase in net foreclosed property expense is primarily due to maintenance and administrationassociated with a higher volume of OREO properties, coupled with higher valuation write-downs in 2010 as compared to the prior year.    Insurance expense increased $3.9 million, or 17%, from 2009. Excluding the $5.1 million FDIC special assessment in 2009, deposit insurance premiums increased 51% in 2010 due to the combined effect of ahigher deposit base upon which fees are assessed, higher fee rates, and the additional 10 basis point assessment paid on covered transaction accounts exceeding $250,000 under the Transaction Account Guarantee Program.   Loan and collection expense increased $5.0 million, or 52%, from 2009 due to a higher volume of appraisals and legal costs incurred inconnection with credit remediation efforts on our nonperforming loans.    Other expenses increased $4.8 million, or 31%, from2009. The increase was attributable to a $6.1 million increase in the provision for unfunded commitments offset by a $1.2 million decrease in restructuring charges primarily relating to 2009.    Income Taxes    Our provision for income taxes includes both federaland state income tax expense. An analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods 2009 through 2011 are presented in the following table.   Table 6   Income Tax Provision Analysis    (Dollars in thousands)                              Years ended December 31,             2011         2010         2009        Income (loss) before income tax provision       $          70,200             $  64              $  (50,380)           Income tax expense (benefit)       $  25,660             $          (1,737)             $          (20,564)           Effective income tax (benefit) rate         36.6%               n/m                -40.8%                      n/m        Not meaningful    Generally, our effective income tax rate varies from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%(federal income tax benefit rate for 2009) principally due to state income taxes, the effects of tax-exempt earnings from municipal securities and bank owned life insurance, non-deductible compensation and business expenses and tax credits.   For 2011, the effective tax rate was also impacted by a $2.8 million tax benefit associated with the repricing of ourdeferred tax asset due to a change in the Illinois corporate income tax rate that became effective during the first quarter. Excluding this one-time benefit in 2011, our effective income tax rate would have been 40.6%. The impact of the Illinois taxrate increase on 2011 pre-tax earnings increased our effective tax rate by approximately 0.9%. We expect our effective income tax rate in 2012 to be modestly higher than this adjusted 2011 rate (40.6%) due primarily to share price valuation andits impact on the tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, as discussed below.    The effective tax rate in 2010 wasnot meaningful because the small amount of pre-tax income caused the permanent differences described above to disproportionately impact the effective tax rate compared to what would have normally been expected.   Realization of Deferred Tax Assets    Net deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.       43     During the first three quarterly periods of 2011, we were in a cumulative pre-tax lossposition for financial statement purposes, measured on a trailing three-year period basis. Under current accounting guidance, this represents significant negative evidence in the assessment of whether deferred tax assets will be realized. AtDecember 31, 2011, we are no longer in a cumulative book loss position. We have concluded that based on the weight provided by certain positive evidence (discussed below), it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will berealized.    Taxable income in prior years and reversing deferred taxable income amounts provide sources from which deferred taxassets may be absorbed. Most significantly, however, we have relied on our ability to generate future federal taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences, as the primary source from which deferred tax assets will be absorbed.   In making the determination at December 31, 2011 that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will berealized, we considered the positive evidence associated with (a) taxable income generated in 2010 and 2011, (b) reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods, (c) our emergence from a cumulative book loss position in2011, (d) continued improvement in pre-tax, pre-loan loss provision earnings results during 2009-2011, a core source for future taxable income, (e) our reporting of pre-tax profits during most of 2010 and 2011, (f) the concentrationof credit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio during the past three years and the relative moderation of credit trends in recent quarters, (g) our excess capital position relative to well capitalizedregulatory standards and other industry benchmarks, and (h) no history of federal net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of the 20-year federal net operating loss carryforward period.   We considered negative evidence associated with the continuing challenging economic conditions as well as both positive and negativeevidence associated with: (a) our accuracy in forecasting operating income and credit costs; and (b) the estimated timing of reversals of deferred deductible and deferred taxable items and the level of such net reversal amounts relative toearnings run rate assumptions in future periods.    Certain of the factors noted above support our expectation of generatingpre-tax book earnings in future periods. We believe this in turn should give rise to taxable income levels (exclusive of reversing temporary differences) that more likely than not would be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets.   At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $13 million of deferred tax assets that relate to equity compensation awards, includingboth unexercised stock options and unvested restricted shares. In both cases, the deferred tax assets may not be fully realized in future periods primarily due to stock price valuation. Currently, most of our stock options are out of themoney with an exercise price above our current stock price. Depending in part on changes in our stock price, we could incur tax charges at the expiration date of the options or prior to that time if employees terminate and out-of-the moneyoptions expire, or in certain instances, when employees exercise options. In the case of restricted shares, the tax benefits will not be fully realized if the fair market value of the awards on the vesting/release date is less than the value of theawards on the grant/modification date.    In such circumstances where there is a shortfall in tax benefits on theexercise, vesting or expiration of an equity award, such shortfall amounts are charged to stockholders equity if there is a sufficient level of excess tax benefits accumulated from prior years. During 2011 and 2010,such shortfall amounts charged to stockholders equity totaled $2.6 million and $3.6 million, respectively. In addition, during 2011, we charged $645,000 of such shortfall tax benefits to income tax expense because the balance ofcumulative prior year excess tax benefits was reduced to $0. This resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate in 2011. Based on our current stock price level, scheduled vesting of restricted shares and anticipated optionexpirations, we expect to incur additional shortfall tax charges in 2012 which will put upward pressure on our effective income tax rate as described above. The amount of such shortfall charges in 2012 and in future periodsis dependent on changes in our stock price as well as the impact of employee terminations, option exercise decisions and other factors.   Operating Segments Results    We have three primary business segments: Banking, Trust and Investments, and Holding Company Activities.    Banking    The profitability of our Banking segment is dependent on netinterest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. The net income for the Banking segment for 2011 was $71.9 million, a $38.2 million increase from net income of $33.7 million for 2010. The increase in netincome for the Banking segment was primarily due to a $61.6 million in lower provision for loan losses offset by $8.8 million in higher non-interest expense in 2011 as compared to the prior year. Net income for the Banking segment increased $28.8million from 2009 to 2010, which was primarily due to $73.5 million in higher net interest income, offset by $50.7 million in higher non-interest expense during 2010 as compared to the prior year.       44     Total loans for the Banking segment decreased to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2011,compared to $9.1 billion at December 31, 2010. Total deposits decreased from December 31, 2010 levels of $10.7 billion to $10.5 billion at December 31, 2011.    Trust and Investments    The Trust and Investments segment includesinvestment management, investment advisory, personal trust and estate administration, custodial and escrow, retirement account administration, and brokerage services. Lodestar Investment Counsel, LLC (Lodestar), an investment managementfirm and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, is included in our Trust and Investments segment. During 2011, we purchased the remaining minority ownership interests of Lodestar held by certain members of Lodestar management, who remain with theCompany in management roles.    Net income attributable to controlling interests from Trust and Investments increased to$668,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011, from a net loss of $20,000 for 2010, and down from $1.0 million for 2009. The increase in net income from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to a decrease in non-interest expense. AUMA remainedrelatively flat at $4.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.    Holding Company Activities   The Holding Company Activities segment consists of parent company-only activity and intersegment eliminations. TheHolding Companys most significant asset is its investment in its bank subsidiary. Undistributed earnings relating to this investment is not included in the Holding Company financial results. Holding Company financial results are representedprimarily by interest expense on borrowings and operating expenses. Recurring operating expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation and professional fees. The Holding Company Activities segment reported a net loss of $28.2 million for theyear ended December 31, 2011, compared to a net loss of $32.2 million for the same period in 2010 and a net loss of $35.9 million for 2009. The reduction is due to lower interest expense on certain junior subordinated debt securities which haverepriced downward, as well as reduced professional fees.    Additional information about our operating segments are alsodiscussed in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    FINANCIAL CONDITION   Investment Portfolio Management    We manage our investment portfolio to maximize the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines, to meet pledging and liquidity requirements, and to adjust balance sheet interest ratesensitivity to attempt to serve as some protection for net interest income levels against the impact of changes in interest rates.    We may adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio according to a number of factors, including expected liquidity needs, the current and forecasted interest rate environment, our actualand anticipated balance sheet growth rate, the relative value of various segments of the securities markets, and the broader economic and regulatory environment.    Investments are comprised of debt securities and non-marketable equity investments. Our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of residential mortgage-backed pools, collateralized mortgageobligations, U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, and state and municipal bonds.    Debt securities that are classified asavailable-for-sale are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of our asset/liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk. Unrealized gains and losses onavailable-for-sale securities represent the difference between the aggregated cost and fair value of the portfolio and are reported, on an after-tax basis, as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. This balancesheet component will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change, which changes affect the aggregate fair value of the portfolio. In periods of significant market volatility, we may experience significant changes in accumulatedother comprehensive income. Accumulated other comprehensive income is not included in the calculation of regulatory capital.   Debt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity are securities we have the ability and intent to hold until maturity and areaccounted for using historical cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.    Non-marketable equityinvestments include Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock and various other equity securities. At December 31, 2011, our investment in FHLB stock was $40.7 million, compared to $20.7 million at December 31, 2010. To increase oursources of liquidity, during the third quarter 2011, we became a member of the FHLB Chicago and purchased $23.7 million of FHLB Chicago stock. FHLB stock holdings are necessary to maintain FHLB advances and availability. Also included innon-      45     marketable equity investments are certain interests we have in investment funds that make qualifying investments for purposes of our compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act(CRA). Such investments had a carrying amount of $2.9 million at December 31, 2011.    We do not own anyFreddie Mac or Fannie Mae preferred stock or subordinated debt obligations, bank trust preferred securities, or any sub-prime mortgage-backed securities.

During 2011, purchases in securities totaled $1.1 billion with $557.6 million in the available-for-sale portfolio,$497.9 million in the held-to-maturity portfolio, and the remaining $24.3 million in non-marketable equity investments, primarily FHLB stock.    During 2011, to mitigate the future other comprehensive income volatility of adding bonds to the available-for-sale portfolio in a low interest rate environment, we established a held-to-maturityportfolio with the purchase of $490.1 million in residential mortgage-backed securities and $71,000 in state and municipal securities. We anticipate continuing to add opportunistically to the held-to-maturity portfolio.   The current year purchases in the investment portfolio primarily represent the reinvestment of proceeds from sales, maturities, andpaydowns in largely similar residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, as well as the reinvestment of growth in the balance sheet.    Also, during 2011, we sold $188.8 million of collateralized mortgage obligations, $66.0 million of residential mortgage-backed securities, $19.5 million of state and municipal securities, and $15.8million in U.S. Agency securities, resulting in a net securities gain of $5.8 million. The sales assisted in managing prepayment risk and provided a measure of benefit to our capital position.   Investments in collateralized mortgage obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities comprise 88% of the total portfolio atDecember 31, 2011. All of the mortgage securities are backed by U.S. Government agencies or issued by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises. All mortgage securities are composed of fixed-rate, fully-amortizing collateral with final maturitiesof 30 years or less.       46     Investments in debt instruments of state and local municipalities comprised 7% of the totalportfolio at December 31, 2011. This type of security has historically experienced very low default rates and provided a predictable cash flow since generally it is not subject to significant prepayment. Insurance companies regularly providecredit enhancement to improve the credit rating and liquidity of a municipal bond issuance. Management considers the credit enhancement and underlying municipality credit rating when evaluating a purchase or sale decision.   At December 31, 2011, our reported equity reflected unrealized net securities gains on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, of$45.1 million, an increase of $25.1 million from December 31, 2010. The change in net unrealized gains compared to the prior year was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates.   The following table presents the maturities of the different types of investments that we owned at December 31, 2011 and thecorresponding interest rates.

Actual repricings and yields of the securities may differ from those reflected in the table depending upon actual interest rates and prepayment speeds.        (2)      Yields on state and municipal securities are reflected on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. The maturity date ofstate and municipal bonds is based on contractual maturity, unless the bond, based on current market prices, is deemed to have a high probability that a call right will be exercised, in which case the call date is used as the maturity date.       (3)      The yield on FHLB stock is based on dividend announcements.         n/a      Not applicable    LOANPORTFOLIO AND CREDIT QUALITY (excluding covered assets)    Our principal source of revenue arises from our lendingactivities, primarily composed of interest income and, to a lesser extent, loan origination and commitment fees, net of related costs. The accounting policies underlying the recording of loans in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Conditionand the recognition and/or deferral of interest income and fees, net of costs, arising from lending activities are included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.       47     The following discussion of our loan portfolio and credit quality excludes covered assets.Covered assets represent assets acquired through an FDIC-assisted transaction that are subject to a loss share agreement and are presented separately on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. For additional discussion of covered assets,refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Covered Assets.   Portfolio Composition    Total loans, excluding covered assets, were $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2011, compared to $9.1 billion at December 31, 2010. We continue to strategically reshape our mix of loan products,focusing on commercial loan originations to build our portfolio, funding approximately $1.4 billion in new client relationships since year end 2010. The new loan origination activity was offset by payoffs, paydowns, and disposition activitymotivated by our desire to improve asset quality and financial performance. As a result of these ongoing efforts, commercial loans (including owner-occupied commercial real estate loans) increased by $534.6 million during the year and increased as aproportion of total loans to 60% at December 31, 2011, compared to 53% at December 31, 2010. Commercial real estate and construction loans decreased by $539.2 million, or 16%, and represented 32% of total loans at December 31, 2011,compared to 38% at December 31, 2010. We may continue to actively seek to exit accounts that no longer align strategically or do not meet return or other performance hurdles.

Our commercial loan portfolio is categorized based on our most significant industry segments, as classified pursuant to the North American Industrial Classification System standard industry description. Thesecategories are based on the nature of the clients ongoing business activity as opposed to the collateral underlying an individual loan. To the extent that a clients underlying business activity changes, classification differences betweenperiods will arise.

Within our commercial lending business, we have a specialized niche in the assisted living, nursing and residential care segment of the healthcare industry. At December 31, 2011, 23% ofthe commercial loan portfolio had been extended primarily to operators in this segment to finance the working capital needs and cost of facilities providing such services. These loans tend to be larger extensions of credit and are primarily tofor-profit businesses. To date, this portfolio segment has experienced minimal defaults and losses.    Commercial real estatedecreased $295.4 million from December 31, 2010 due to a combination of problem loan dispositions, fewer new originations (although we experienced some increased activity during the second half of 2011), and transitional financing being repaidor refinanced as expected in the secondary market for long-term permanent financing or by other external sources. The collateral underlying our commercial real estate portfolio is principally located in and around our core markets and issignificantly concentrated in the Chicago metropolitan area. Declines of $243.7 million in the construction portfolio from December 31, 2010 are partially due to projects reaching completion at which point they are reclassified into thecommercial real estate category, as well as problem loan dispositions, payoffs or paydowns, and movements to OREO.

Of the combined commercial real estate and construction portfolios, the single largest category atDecember 31, 2011 was office real estate, which represented 21% of the combined portfolios. Our total exposure to land loans in the combined portfolios declined to $254.0 million at December 31, 2011 from $357.5 million atDecember 31, 2010. Our longer-term goal is to reduce land loans as a percentage of the loan portfolio, although further meaningful reduction of our land loan exposure may be challenging in the near term due to the current illiquidity of thisasset class. As a percentage of the total commercial real estate and construction portfolios, land loans declined from 11% at December 31, 2010 to 9% at December 31, 2011.       50     Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity of Loan Portfolio   The following table summarizes the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2011, by category, as well as theinterest rate sensitivity of loans in these categories that have maturities in excess of one year.

On a number of occasions we have eliminated customers interest rate floors in consideration of their enteringinto interest rate swap transactions with us.    Delinquent Loans, Special Mention and Potential Problem Loans, and Nonperforming Assets   Loans are reported delinquent if the required principal and interest payments have not been received within 30 daysof the date such payment is due. Delinquency can be driven by either failure of the borrower to make payments within the term of the loan or failure to make the final payment at maturity. The majority of our loans are not fully amortizing over theterm. As a result, a sizeable final repayment is often required at maturity. If a borrower lacks refinancing options or the ability to pay, the loan may become delinquent at maturity. Of total commercial real estate and construction loansoutstanding at December 31, 2011, $274.3 million are scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2012, of which all but 1% were performing at December 31, 2011.    Loans considered special mention are performing in accordance with the contractual terms but demonstrate potential weakness that if left unresolved, may result in deterioration in the Companyscredit position and/or the repayment prospects for the credit. Borrowers rated special mention may exhibit adverse operating trends, high leverage, tight liquidity, or other credit concerns.   Potential problem loans are loans that we have identified as performing in accordance with contractual terms, but for which managementhas some level of concern (greater than that of special mention loans) about the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms in future periods. These loans continue to accrue interest but the ultimate collection of these loans isquestionable due to the same conditions that characterize a special mention credit. These credits may also be considered inadequately protected by the current net worth and/or paying capacity of the obligor or guarantors or the collateral pledged.These loans generally have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that may jeopardize collection of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not resolved. Althoughthese loans are generally identified as potential problem loans and require additional attention by management, they may never become nonperforming.    Special mention and potential problem loans as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are presented in Table 19.    Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure proceedings and are awaiting disposition and are presented in Table 14. Nonperformingloans consist of nonaccrual loans, including restructured loans that remain on nonaccrual. We specifically exclude certain restructured loans that accrue interest from our definition of nonperforming loans if the borrower has demonstrated theability to meet the new terms of the restructuring as evidenced by a       51     minimum of at least six months of performance in compliance with the restructured terms or if the borrowers performance prior to the restructuring or other significant events at the time ofthe restructuring supports returning or maintaining the loan on accrual status. All loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest payments become 90 days past due or earlier if management deems the collectability of the principalor interest to be in question rather than waiting until the loans become 90 days past due. When interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is reversed reducing interest income. Subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans arerecorded in the financial statements as a reduction of principal, and interest income is only recorded on a cash basis after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily preclude the ultimatecollection of loan principal and/or interest. Nonperforming loans are presented in Tables 14, 15, 17, and 19.    Foreclosedassets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans secured by a mortgage on real property. Foreclosed assets are recorded at the lesser of current carrying value or estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs atthe time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses. On a periodic basis, the carrying values of these properties are adjusted based upon new appraisals and/or market indications.Write-downs are recorded for subsequent declines in net realizable value and are included in non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties. Additional information on our OREO is presented in Tables 20 through22.    As part of our ongoing risk management practices and in certain circumstances, we may extend or modify the terms of aloan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties. The modification may consist of concessionary reduction in interest rate, extension of the maturity date, reduction in the principal balance, orother action intended to minimize potential losses that would otherwise not be considered in order to improve the chance of a successful recovery on the loan. Such concessions as part of a modification are accounted for as troubled debtrestructurings (TDRs). Restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. We may utilize a multiplenote structure as a workout alternative for certain loans. The multiple note structure typically bifurcates a troubled loan into two separate notes, where the first note is reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to the modifiedterms, and the second note of the troubled loan that is not reasonably assured of repayment is charged-off. TDRs accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has historically demonstrated repaymentperformance at a level commensurate with the modified terms; otherwise, the restructured loan will be classified as nonaccrual. Restructured loans accruing interest were $100.9 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $87.6 million atDecember 31, 2010. Of total restructured loans accruing interest modified during the year ended December 31, 2011, 59% were modified to extend the maturity date and 85% were from commercial loan relationships. The composition of ourrestructured loans accruing interest by loan category and our recorded investment is presented in Tables 14 and 18. During 2011, $6.6 million in loans that were previously classified as a restructured loans accruing interest were subsequentlyre-underwritten as pass rated credits which is evidence that the borrower would no longer be considered troubled, and as such, the TDR classification was removed.    Total nonperforming assets declined 15% to $385.6 million at December 31, 2011 from $454.6 million at December 31, 2010, reflecting strong progress in improving the overall asset quality of theportfolio and reducing problem assets. Nonperforming assets were 3.11% of total assets at December 31, 2011, compared to 3.65% at December 31, 2010. During the year, total nonperforming loans declined by $106.0 million, or 29%, due todisposition activity, moderating nonperforming loan inflows, and movement of nonperforming loans to OREO. OREO increased $37.0 million, or 42%, from December 31, 2010, as problem loans continue to progress through the workout process.   Disposition activity and ongoing workout efforts drove a reduction in special mention and potential problem loans. Loans inthese early stage problem loan categories were down $524.4 million, or 58%, from December 31, 2010 to $382.1 million at December 31, 2011. Disposition activity in 2011 included the sale of $308.9 million in problem loans, including $97.0million in nonperforming loans, and $79.0 million in OREO at a 15% net incremental charge based on the carrying value net of specific reserves at the time of disposition. In 2012, we will continue to assess the market for the best dispositionstrategy and approach. As we work through the remainder of the portfolio, we may see some fluctuations in disposition prices.   Nonperforming loans were $259.9 million at December 31, 2011, down 29% from $365.9 million at December 31, 2010. The amount ofnonperforming loan inflows, which is primarily composed of potential problem loans moving through the workout process (i.e., moving from potential problem to nonperforming status), were $341.5 million for 2011 compared to $447.4 million for 2010.Inflows to nonperforming loans were more than offset by problem loan resolutions (including transfers to OREO), dispositions, and charge-offs during 2011. As shown in Table 17 providing nonperforming loan stratification by size, twelve nonperformingloans in excess of $5.0 million comprised 52% of our total nonperforming loans at December 31, 2011. Commercial real estate and construction loans were 60% of our total nonperforming loans at December 31, 2011, reflecting the stress in thesector.    As discussed above, our focused asset management activities led to declines in special mention and potential problemloans year over year as we have worked to improve overall credit quality. Since the majority of inflows to nonperforming loans have been migrating from the special mention or potential problem loan categories, we expect that future nonperformingloan inflows will likely continue to moderate. However, because many of our potential problem loans are commercial real estate-related, a highly-stressed loan sector,       52     and because the potential problem loan population contains some larger-sized credits, our total nonperforming loans may fluctuate over the next several quarters as we continue to executeremediation plans and work through the credit cycle. In addition, credit quality trends may also be impacted by the uncertainty in global economic conditions and market turmoil that could disrupt workout plans, adversely affect clients, ornegatively impact collateral valuations. Further, net nonperforming asset levels could fluctuate depending on the timing of dispositions or other remediation actions. Our efforts to continue to dispose of nonperforming and problem assets in futurequarters may be impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the pace and timing of the overall recovery of the economy, activity levels in the real estate market, real estate inventory coming into the market for sale andcollateral asset class.

to $88.7 million at December 31, 2010, and is comprised of 400properties. The increase in OREO properties from year end 2010 reflects our efforts to move problem loans through the credit management collection process by means of foreclosure or other resolution strategy to gain control of the real estatecollateral for ultimate sale. Given current economic conditions and the difficult real estate market, the time required to sell these properties in an orderly fashion has increased, and OREO is likely to remain elevated as nonperforming commercialreal estate loans continue to move through the collection process. OREO is recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan at the time of acquisition or the fair value, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales,and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Updated appraisals on OREO are typically obtained every twelve months and evaluated internally at least every six months.

Credit Quality Management and Allowance for Loan Losses   We maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in the loanportfolio. The allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time. The allowanceis not a prediction of our actual credit losses going forward based on current and available information. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that areconsidered to be impaired (the specific component of the allowance), as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified (the general allocated component of the allowance), which isdetermined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors and management judgment applied to defined segments of our loan portfolio.    The specific component of the allowance relates to impaired loans. Impaired loans consist of nonaccrual loans (which include nonaccrual TDRs) and loans classified as accruing TDRs. A loan is considerednonaccrual when, based on current information and events, management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Allloans that are over 90 days past due in principal or interest are by definition considered impaired and placed on nonaccrual status. Management may also place some loans on nonaccrual status before they are 90 days past due if they meetthe above definition of impaired. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the loans observable fair value, the fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs if the loanis collateral-dependent, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. Impaired loans exceeding $500,000 are evaluated individually while smaller loans are evaluated as pools usinghistorical loss experience as well as managements loss expectations for the respective asset class and product type. If the estimated fair value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (including accrued interest,net of deferred loan fees and costs and unamortized premium or discount), impairment is recognized by creating a specific reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses. The recognition of any reserve required on new impaired loans isrecorded in the same quarter in which the transfer of the loan to nonaccrual status occurred. All impaired loans are reviewed quarterly for any changes that would affect the specific reserve. Any impaired loan in which a determination has been madethat the economic value is permanently reduced is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses to reflect its current economic value in the period in which the determination has been made.       60     When collateral-dependent real estate loans are determined to be impaired, updatedappraisals are typically obtained every twelve months and evaluated internally at least every six months. In addition, both borrower and market-specific factors are taken into consideration, which may result in obtaining more frequent appraisalupdates or internal assessments. Appraisals are conducted by third-party independent appraisers under internal direction and engagement. Any appraisal with a value in excess of $250,000 is subject to a compliance review. Appraisals received with avalue in excess of $1.0 million are subject to a technical review. Appraisals are either reviewed internally or sent to an outside technical firm if appropriate. Both levels of review involve a scope appropriate for the complexity and riskassociated with the loan and its collateral. We consider other factors or recent developments which could adjust the valuations indicated in the appraisals or internal reviews. As of December 31, 2011, the average appraisal age used in theimpaired loan valuation process was approximately 200 days. The amount of impaired assets which, by policy, requires an independent appraisal, but does not have a current external appraisal at year end due to the timing of the receipt of theappraisal is not material to the overall reserve. In situations such as this, we establish a probable impairment reserve for the account based on our experience in the related asset class and type.   The general allocated component of the allowance is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative andqualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio. The methodology takes into account at a product level the originating line of business and vintage (transformational or legacy), the origination year, the risk rating migration of thenote, and historical default and loss history of similar products. Using this information, the methodology produces a range of possible reserve amounts by product type. We consider the appropriate balance of the general allocated component of thereserve within these ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by the model as well as market and economic data and management judgment. In certain instances,these additional factors and judgments may lead to managements conclusion that the appropriate level of the reserve is outside the range determined through the framework. In our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance at December 31,2011, we considered a number of factors for each product that included, but were not limited to, the following: for the commercial portfolio, the pace of growth in the commercial loan sector, the existence of larger individual credits andspecialized industry concentrations, and general macroeconomic indicators such as GDP employment trends, and manufacturing activity, which overall show some signs of improvement in recent months, but still are susceptible to sustainability risk andpossible negative ramifications from the European debt crisis; for the commercial real estate portfolio, the potential impact of general commercial real estate trends, particularly occupancy and leasing rate trends, charge-off severity andcollateral value changes; for the construction portfolio, construction employment, industry experience on construction loan losses, and construction spending rates, and for the residential, home equity, and personal portfolios, home price indicesand sales volume, vacancy rates, delinquency rates and general economic conditions and interest rate trends which impact these products. The Bank has limited exposure with a related junior collateral position in any product type with the exceptionof Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). This product is by definition usually secured in the junior position to the first mortgage on the related property. The Bank evaluates the allowance for loan losses for HELOCs as one of our six primary,segregated product types. Default rates on our HELOC portfolio have historically been below industry averages and our allowance reflects the performance and loss history unique to our portfolio .  The establishment of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment and includes an inherent level of imprecision giventhe difficulty of identifying all the factors impacting loan repayment and the timing of when losses actually occur. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon avariety of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, client performance, the economy, changes in interest rates and property values, and the interpretation by regulatory authorities of loan classifications.   Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately and consider this process to be an important creditmanagement tool, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire loan portfolio.    Management evaluates theadequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reviews the allowance for loan losses and the underlying methodology with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors quarterly. As of December 31, 2011, management concluded the allowance forloan losses was adequate (i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the portfolio at that date, including those not yet identifiable).    As an integral part of their examination process, various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require that certain loan balances beclassified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.   The accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the allowance for loan losses through provisions charged tooperating expense are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.       61     The following table presents changes in the allowance for loan losses, excluding coveredassets, for the past five years.

The decrease in the allowance is primarily the result of an improved credit risk profile for the performing portfolio as reflected in the reduced levels of special mention and potential problem loans andimproving loan portfolio mix due to the reshaping activities previously discussed. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans (excluding covered assets) was 2.13% at December 31, 2011, down from 2.44% as of December 31,2010. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 74% compared to the December 31, 2010 level of 61%. The provision for loan losses was $130.6 million for 2011, compared to $192.0 million in 2010.   For 2011, net charge-offs totaled $161.8 million as compared to $190.9 million in 2010. Continued high levels of charge-offs reflect realestate collateral values, particularly land values, which have remained low. Commercial real estate comprised 65% of net charge-offs in 2011, reflecting the challenging market conditions associated with these loan types.       62     The following table presents our allocation of the allowance for loan losses by specificcategory for the past five years.

The reduction in thegeneral allocated reserve was primarily influenced by the improved risk profile of the performing portfolio during the year, as exposure in special mention and potential problem loans declined by $524.4 million, or 58%, due in part to the sale orother disposition of these problem credits. Also, the portfolio is becoming more weighted in transformational and commercial loans, where our historical credit performance has been better, and less weighted in legacy and commercial real estateloans, where historical performance has been weaker. This changing mix positively impacts reserve requirements, based on our historical loss experience to date.    The allocated reserve for our commercial real estate and construction portfolios, which represented 52% of our total allocated reserve at December 31, 2011, declined $25.2 million, or 28%, fromDecember 31, 2010. The decrease in this allocation is primarily due to a lower balance and improved risk ratings of remaining loans in the commercial real estate and construction sectors at the end of the current year as compared to the prioryear. The combined coverage ratio of the allocated reserve for these portfolios was 2.2% at December 31, 2011 and 2.6% at December 31, 2010.    Specific Component of the Allowance    At December 31, 2011, thespecific component of the allowance decreased by $1.1 million to $69.9 million from $71.0 million at December 31, 2010. The specific reserve requirements are primarily influenced by new loan additions to nonperforming status, as well as changesto collateral values. Our impaired loans are primarily collateral-dependent with such loans totaling $291.1 million of the total $360.8 million in impaired loans at December 31, 2011.   Reserve for Unfunded Commitments    In addition to the allowance for loan losses, we maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded creditfacilities. At December 31, 2011, our reserve for unfunded commitments declined $842,000 from December 31, 2010 to $7.2 million as a result of an improved risk profile of the portfolio and a lower propensity to fund. Net adjustments to thereserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Unfunded commitments, excluding covered assets, totaled $4.4 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010,respectively.       63     COVERED ASSETS    Covered assets represent purchased loans and foreclosed loan collateral covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC as a result of the 2009 FDIC-assisted acquisition of the former Founders Bankfrom the FDIC. Under the loss share agreements, the FDIC generally will assume 80% of the first $173 million of credit losses and 95% of the credit losses in excess of $173 million, in both cases relating to assets existing at the date ofacquisition.    The carrying amounts of covered assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are presented in the following table:   Table 25   Covered Assets    (Amounts in thousands)                          December 31,             2011         2010        Commercial loans       $  31,568            $  44,812          Commercial real estate loans         150,210              189,194          Residential mortgage loans         50,403              56,748          Consumer installment and other loans         6,123              9,129          Foreclosed real estate         30,342              32,155          Assets in lieu         -              469          Estimated loss reimbursement by the FDIC         38,161              64,703                                              Total covered assets         306,807              397,210          Allowance for covered loan losses         (25,939)             (15,334)                                             Net covered assets       $        280,868            $        381,876                                             Total covered assets decreased by $90.4 million, or 23%, from $397.2 million at December 31, 2010 to$306.8 million at December 31, 2011. The reduction is primarily attributable to $59.1 million in principal paydowns, net of advances, as well as the resulting impact of such on the evaluation of expected cash flows and discount accretionlevels. In addition, the estimated loss reimbursement by the FDIC (the FDIC indemnification receivable) further contributed to the reduction as a result of loss claims paid by the FDIC. The allowance for covered loan losses increased by$10.6 million to $25.9 million at December 31, 2011 from $15.3 million at December 31, 2010, reflecting a further credit deterioration in expected cash flows on certain pools of covered loans since the date of acquisition. Of the totalincrease in the allowance for covered loan losses, 80% was offset through the FDIC indemnification receivable and the remaining 20% representing the non-reimbursable portion of the loss share agreement recognized as a charge to provision for loanand covered loan losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2011, the FDIC had reimbursed the Company $88.6 million in losses under the loss share agreements.   The following table presents covered loan delinquencies and nonperforming covered assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 andexcludes purchased impaired loans which are accounted for on a pool basis. Since each purchased impaired pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past due status ofthe pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. Because we are recognizing interest income on each pool of such loans, they are all considered to be performing. Covered assets are excluded from the asset qualitypresentation of our originated loan portfolio, given the loss share indemnification from the FDIC.

We also have in place contingency funding plans designed to allow us tooperate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding may be constrained. As part of our asset/liability management strategy, we utilize a variety of funding sources in an effort to optimize the balance of duration risk, cost,liquidity risk and contingency planning.    The Banks principal sources of funds are client deposits, including largeinstitutional deposits, capital contributions by the parent company, and cash from operations. The Banks principal uses of funds include funding growth in the core asset portfolios, including loans, and to a lesser extent, our investmentportfolio, which is used primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk. The primary sources of funding for the holding company include dividends when received from its bank subsidiary, intercompany tax reimbursements from the Bank, andproceeds from the issuance of senior, subordinated and convertible debt, as well as equity. Primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt, interest paid to our debt holders, dividends paid to stockholders, andcapital contributions to the Bank.    We consider client deposits our core funding source. AtDecember 31, 2011, 84% of our total assets were funded by client deposits, compared to 80% at December 31, 2010. We define client deposits as all deposits other than traditional brokered deposits and non-client CDARS ®  (as described in the footnotes to Table 27 below). While we expect overall liquidity in the banking system to remainhigh until economic recovery and market factors improve, the level of our client deposits may fluctuate based on client needs, seasonality and other economic or market factors. If the client deposits fluctuate due to any of these factors, we willutilize other external sources of liquidity, including wholesale funding.    Given the commercial focus of our core businessstrategy, a majority of our deposit base is comprised of corporate accounts which are typically larger than retail accounts. We have built a suite of deposit and cash management products and services that support our efforts to attract and retaincorporate client accounts. Thirteen client relationships, each with greater than $75 million in deposits accounted for $2.2 billion, or 21% of total deposits at December 31, 2011. A majority of the deposits greater than $75 million are fromfinancial services related businesses, including omnibus accounts from broker-dealer and mortgage companies representing underlying accounts of their customers that may be eligible for pass-through deposit insurance limits. Thirty-two relationships,each with greater than $50 million in deposits, accounted for $3.3 billion, or 32% or total deposits at December 31, 2011. We take deposit concentration risk into account in managing our liquid asset levels. Liquid assets refer to cash on hand,federal funds sold, unpledged securities, as well as collateral based borrowing. Net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and certain deposits that requirecollateral. Net liquid assets at the Bank were $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We maintain liquidity at levels we believe sufficient to meet anticipated client liquidity needs, fund anticipated loangrowth, selectively purchase securities and investments and opportunistically pay down wholesale funds.   While we first look toward internally generated deposits as our funding source, we utilize wholesale funding,including brokered deposits, as needed to enhance liquidity and to fund asset growth. Brokered deposits are deposits that are sourced from external and unrelated financial institutions by a third party. This funding requires advance notification tostructure the type of deposit desired by the Bank. Brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of longer-term funding. Our asset/liability management policy currently limits our use ofbrokered deposits, excluding reciprocal CDARS ® , to levels no more than 25% of total deposits, and total brokereddeposits to levels no more than 40% of total deposits. At December 31, 2011, brokered deposits exclusive of reciprocalCDARS ®  were less than 1% of total deposits while total brokered deposits were 8% of total deposits.   Our cash flows are comprised of three classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, andcash flows from financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities primarily include results of operations for the year, adjusted for items in net income that did not impact cash. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $62.1million from 2010 to $270.3 million for 2011, which was primarily due to an increase in net income from the prior year. Cash flows from investing activities reflect the impact of loans and investments acquired for our interest-earning assetportfolios and asset sales. For 2011, net cash used in investing activities was $405.2 million, compared to $504.0 million for the prior year. This change in cash flows represents larger amounts of cash redeployed towards investments and loans inthe prior year than the current year. Cash flows from financing activities include transactions and events whereby cash is obtained from depositors, creditors or investors. Net cash used in financing activities for 2011 was $157.5 million, comparedto net cash provided by financing activities of $410.9 million for the prior year. This change in cash flows represents the decrease in total deposits in the current year as compared to the prior year.       65     Deposits   Middle market commercial client relationships from a diversified industry base in our markets are the primary sourceof our deposit base. Due to our middle market commercial banking focused business model, our client deposit base provides access to larger deposit balances that result in a concentrated deposit base. The deposits are held in different depositproducts such as interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand deposits, CDARS ® , savings and money marketaccounts. The following table provides a comparison of deposits by category over the last three years.

We also participate in a non-client CDARS® program that is more like a traditional brokered deposit program.            (2)      Total deposits, net of traditional brokered deposits and non-client CDARS®.   Total deposits at December 31, 2011 decreased by $142.6 million from year end 2010 as money market accounts,non-client CDARS®, and traditional brokered deposits declined, partially offset by increased balances in noninterest-bearing deposits. Client deposits increased by $435.3 million from December 31, 2010 and client deposits as a percentage oftotal deposits also increased from 94% at December 31, 2010 to almost all deposits at December 31, 2011. We anticipate client deposits to fluctuate in line with client needs and usage of liquidity. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew to $3.2billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of 44% compared to one year ago. The increase in noninterest-bearing deposits can be attributed to several factors including growth from existing and new commercial client relationships, client focusedtreasury management product offerings, and deposit movements       66     reflecting our clients desire to hold greater liquidity in this economic environment, as well as temporary unlimited insurance coverage on these types of accounts. From December 31,2011 through December 31, 2012, all noninterest-bearing deposits, with the exception of negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, are fully insured by the FDIC.    In response to the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring repeal of the regulatory prohibition on payment of interest on commercial demand deposits effective in July 2011, we began offering aninterest-bearing checking account for business customers in the third quarter of 2011. As anticipated, this change did not have a material effect on our deposit mix or our cost of funds in the low-rate environment.   Brokered deposits totaled $816.0 million at December 31, 2011, decreasing $634.9 million from December 31,2010 due to a reduced reliance on traditional brokered deposits and non-client CDARS® deposits. Brokered deposits at December 31, 2011 included $795.5 million in client-related CDARS®. Brokered deposits, excluding client CDARS®,declined by $577.9 million from the prior year end and were less than 1% of total deposits at December 31, 2011 compared to 6% at December 31, 2010. Consistent with our funding needs, during 2011, we elected not to replace certain maturingnon-client CDARS® and traditional brokered deposits as total loans remained relatively flat and we continued to see client deposit inflows.    Public balances, denoting the funds held on account for municipalities and other public entities, are included as a part of our total deposits. We enter into specific agreements with certain publiccustomers to pledge collateral, primarily securities, in support of the balances on account. These relationships may provide cross-sell opportunities with treasury management, as well as other business referral opportunities. At December 31,2011, we had public funds on account totaling $927.4 million, of which less than 32% were collateralized with securities. Year-to-year changes in balances are influenced by the tax collection activities of the various municipalities as well as thegeneral level of interest rates.    The following table presents our brokered and time deposits as of December 31, 2011,which are expected to mature during the period specified.

In the event that time deposits are not renewed, we expect to replace thosedeposits with traditional deposits, brokered deposits, or borrowed money sufficient to meet our funding needs.    Short-term Borrowingsand Long-term Debt    Short-term borrowings, which at December 31, 2011 consisted solely of FHLB advances thatmature in one year or less, totaled $156.0 million, increasing by $37.4 million from $118.6 million at December 31, 2010, due to increases in short-term FHLB advances from the prior year. The year-over-year increase is attributable to thereclassification from long-term debt as advances approach maturity. Scheduled maturities of short-term borrowings during the first quarter 2012 total $126.0 million.

The reduction in long-term debt was attributable to FHLB advance activity with $35.0million of FHLB advances reclassified from long-term to short-term during the year.    In addition to on-balance sheet fundingand other liquid assets such as cash and investment securities, we maintain access to various external sources of funding, which assist in the prudent management of funding costs, interest rate risk, and anticipated funding needs or otherconsiderations. Some sources of funding are accessible same-day while others require advance notice. Funds that are immediately accessible include Federal Fund counterparty lines, which are uncommitted lines of credit from other financialinstitutions, and the borrowing term is typically overnight. Availability of Federal Fund lines fluctuate based on market conditions and counterparty relationship strength. Unused overnight Fed Funds borrowings available for use totaled $200.0million and $95.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Repurchase agreements (Repos) are also an immediate source of funding in which we pledge assets to a counterparty against which we can borrow with the agreementto repurchase at a specified date in the future. Repos can vary in term, from overnight to longer, but are regarded as short-term in nature. An additional source of overnight funding is the discount window at the FRB. We maintain access to thediscount window by pledging loans as collateral to the FRB. Funding       68     availability is primarily dictated by the amount of loans pledged, but also impacted by the margin applied to the loans by the FRB. The amount of loans pledged to the FRB can fluctuate due to theavailability of loans eligible under the FRBs criteria which include stipulations of documentation requirements, credit quality, payment status and other criteria. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.1 billion in borrowing capacity throughthe FRB discount windows primary credit program compared to $536.8 million at December 31, 2010. To increase our access to liquidity, during 2011, we became a member of the FHLB Chicago, establishing access to additional FHLB borrowingcapacity of $382.8 million at December 31, 2011.    Refer to Notes 11 and 12 to the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details regarding the junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt facility.    CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES    Through our normal course of operations, we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments. Such obligations generally relate to the funding of operations through deposits or debtissuances, as well as leases for premises and equipment. As a financial services provider, we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit. While contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion ofcommitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process as all comparable loans we make.   The following table presents our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and significant commitments as ofDecember 31, 2011 which are expected to come due and payable during the period specified. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements.

As such, interest charges on relatedcontractual obligations were excluded from reported amounts as the potential cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows form interest-earning assets.        (3)      Includes $42,000 of unamortized broker commissions.        (4)      Purchase obligations exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our Consolidated Statements ofFinancial Condition.    Our operating lease obligations represent short- and long-term lease and rentalpayments for facilities, equipment, and certain software or data processing.    Purchase obligations at December 31, 2011reflect the minimum obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. Our purchase obligations include payments under, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, data,      69     advertising, sponsorships, software license and telecommunications. Purchase obligations also includes the estimated aggregate cash severance amounts (not prohibited under the executivecompensation restrictions applicable to Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program (CPP) participants) that would be due to employees under employment contracts and arrangements, assuming all employees withsuch arrangements were involuntarily terminated on December 31, 2011.    Our commitments to fund civic and communityinvestments, which represent future cash outlays for the construction and development of properties for low-income housing, small business real estate, and historic tax credit projects that qualify for CRA purposes, are not included in thecontractual obligations table above. The timing and amounts of these commitments are projected based upon the financing arrangements provided in each projects partnership or operating agreement, and could change due to variances in theconstruction schedule, project revisions, or the cancellation of the project.    As of December 31, 2011, the Company had$454,000 of unrecognized tax benefits (exclusive of net interest expense accruals) that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. Because the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted withreasonable certainty, this estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information anddisclosure related to uncertain tax positions.    Due to the recent uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debtholdings, particularly those countries experiencing significant economic, fiscal or political strains, there are concerns regarding the risks to financial institutions as a result of direct and indirect exposures to European sovereign andnon-sovereign debt holdings. As it relates to our investment portfolio, we had no direct funded or non-funded exposure to European sovereign or non-sovereign entities in either our Held-to-Maturity or Available-for-Sale portfolios as of December 31,2011. However, we conduct business with European financial institutions headquartered in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, France, and Germany, related to repurchase agreements, interest rate swaps, balance sheet hedging, foreign exchangetransactions and letter of credit issuance. As is common market practice, certain of our interest rate derivatives and letter of credit transactions with such European financial institutions (including their US branches and subsidiaries) arecollateralized with approximately $54 million of investment securities at December 31, 2011. The interest rate derivative transactions are subject to master netting and collateral support agreements which significantly limit the Companysexposure to loss as they generally require daily posting of collateral. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in a net payable position to each of these European banks. We also maintained cash balances with various European financial institutions inthe aforementioned countries to support our foreign exchange business. As of December 31, 2011, we do not have any outstanding borrowings under lines for repurchase agreements.   The Company may have direct or indirect exposure to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of United States (US)-domiciledcommercial clients. Those entities may be co-borrowers or guarantors of the US parents credit facilities with the Company, and in some cases collateral consisting of assets or stock of those entities may be pledged to the Company to securepayment and performance of those credit facilities. In most cases however, the underwriting and credit decision is based on the performance of the US alone. See, Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for moreinformation.    CAPITAL    Equity totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2011, increasing by $68.8 million from December 31, 2010 and was largely attributable to current year net income and higher net unrealized gains onavailable-for-sale securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income.    Capital Issuances   We did not have any common or preferred stock offerings in either 2011 or 2010.    Capital Management    Under applicable regulatory capital adequacyguidelines, the Company and the Bank are subject to various capital requirements adopted and administered by the federal banking agencies. These guidelines specify minimum capital ratios calculated in accordance with the definitions in theguidelines, including the leverage ratio which is Tier 1 capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets, and the Tier 1 capital ratio and the total capital ratio each as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items that havebeen weighted according to broad risk categories. These minimum ratios are shown in the table below.    To satisfy safety andsoundness standards, banking institutions are expected to maintain capital levels in excess of the regulatory minimums depending on the risk inherent in the balance sheet, regulatory expectations and the changing risk profile of business activitiesand plans. Under our capital planning policy, we target capital ratios at levels we believe are appropriate based on such risk considerations, taking into account the current operating and economic environment, internal risk guidelines, and ourstrategic objectives as well as regulatory expectations. At the Bank, primarily due to our credit loss experience and recent levels of nonperforming loans, our policy currently calls for minimum capital ratios of 8.25% Tier 1 leverage and 12.0%total risk-based capital. We have not set a timetable for repaying TARP funds but are continuing to evaluate the best timing and approach for the shareholders and the Company.       70     The following table presents information about our capital measures and the related regulatory capitalguidelines.

Refer to Table 33, Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation to U.S. GAAPpresentation.            n/a    Not applicable    As of December 31, 2011, all of our $244.8 million of outstanding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securities(Debentures) are included in Tier 1 capital. The Tier 1 qualifying amount is limited to 25% of Tier 1 capital under FRB regulations. Further, of the $120.0 million in outstanding subordinated debt facility at December 31, 2011, 60%of the balance qualified as Tier II capital. Effective in the third quarter 2010, Tier II capital qualification was reduced by 20% of the total balance outstanding and annually thereafter will be reduced by an additional 20%. For a full descriptionof our Debentures and subordinated debt, refer to Notes 11 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    For further details of the regulatory capital requirements and ratios as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 for the Company and the Bank, refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    Dividends   We declared dividends of $0.04 per common share during 2011. Based on the closing stock price at December 31, 2011 of $10.98, theannualized dividend yield on our common stock was 0.36%. The dividend payout ratio, which represents the percentage of dividends declared to stockholders to earnings per share, was 9.3% for 2011. We have no current plans to seek to raise dividendson our common stock.       71     As a result of our participation in the TARP CPP, prior to January 30, 2012, we weresubject to various restrictions on our ability to increase the cash dividends we pay on our common stock above the quarterly rate of $0.075 per share, the rate in effect when our participation in TARP CPP began. Although this restriction is nolonger applicable, we still may not pay dividends on our common stock unless we have paid dividends on our outstanding preferred stock, including the CPP preferred stock, and non-voting common stock. In addition, we currently provide notice to andobtain approval from the FRB before declaring or paying any dividends. For additional information regarding limitations and restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, refer to the Supervision and Regulation and RiskFactors sections in Item 1 and Item 1A, respectively, of this Form 10-K.    Stock Repurchase Program   Our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to the applicable restrictions of the CPP following the sale of thepreferred stock to the Treasury under the TARP program. Please refer to EESA in Supervision and Regulation of Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the CPP and TARP programs.   In connection with restrictions on stock repurchases as part of the CPP, we terminated our repurchase program in February 2009. Therestrictions on repurchases will not affect our ability to repurchase shares in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans, as such transactions are in the ordinary course and consistent with our past practice.

IMPACT OF INFLATION    Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and practices within thebanking industry. Under these principles and practices, we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.   Unlike many industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have amore significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation. For analysis of our sensitivity tochanges in interest rates, refer to the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section at Item 7A of this Form 10-K.    NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES    This report contains both U.S. GAAP andnon-U.S. GAAP based financial measures. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures include net interest income, net interest margin, net revenue, operating profit, and efficiency ratio all on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, Tier 1 common equity torisk-weighted assets, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible equity to risk-weighted assets, tangible equity to tangible assets, and tangible book value. We believe that presenting these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures will provideinformation useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance, our business, and performance trends and facilitates comparisons with the performance of others in the banking industry.   We use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating various performance measures by increasing the interest incomeearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments assuming a 35% tax rate. Management believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it enhancescomparability to net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources, and accordingly believes that providing this measure may be useful for peer comparison purposes.   In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, we also consider various measures when evaluating capital utilization andadequacy, including Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible equity to tangible assets, tangible equity to risk-weighted assets, and tangible book value. These calculations are intended tocomplement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. All of these measures exclude the ending balances of goodwill and other intangibles while certain of these ratios exclude preferred capitalcomponents. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, we believe there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. We believe these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are relevant because they provide informationthat is helpful in assessing the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of our capitalization to other companies. However, becausethere are no standardized definitions for these ratios, our calculations may not be comparable with other companies, and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited.       72     Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformlyapplied, and are not audited. Although these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitutefor analyses of results as reported under U.S. GAAP. As a result, we encourage readers to consider our Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Criticalaccounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments based on information available at the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in thefinancial statements and accompanying notes. Future changes in information may affect these estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which, in turn, may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.   Our most significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements of Item 8 of this Form 10-K. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other consolidated financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets andliabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlyingthose amounts, management has determined that our accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and fair value       74     measurements are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to our financial position and results of operations, and, as such, are considered to becritical accounting policies, as discussed below.    Allowance for Loan Losses   We maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loanportfolio. The allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time. The allowanceconsists of provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are individually evaluated for impairment (the specific component), as well as probable losses inherent in our loanportfolio that are not specifically identified (the general allocated component), which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio as well asmanagements judgment.    The specific component relates to impaired loans. Impaired loans consist of nonaccrual loans(which include nonaccrual TDRs) and loans classified as accruing TDRs. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due (bothprincipal and interest) according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the loans observable fair value, fair value of the underlyingcollateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral-dependent, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate.    If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by creating a specific valuation reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses.Impaired loans exceeding $500,000 are evaluated individually, while loans less than $500,000 are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience, as well as managements loss expectations, for the respective asset class and product type.   Impaired loans with specific reserves are reviewed quarterly for any changes that would affect the specific reserve. Anyimpaired loan for which a determination has been made that the economic value is permanently reduced is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses to reflect its current economic value in the period in which the determination has been made.   At the time a collateral-dependent loan is initially determined to be impaired, we review the existing collateral appraisal.If the most recent appraisal is greater than a year old, a new appraisal is obtained on the underlying collateral. Appraisals for loans in excess of $500,000 are updated with a new independent appraisal at least annually and are formally reviewed byour internal appraisal department upon receipt of a new appraisal as well as at the six-month interval between the independent appraisals. All impaired loans and their related reserves are reviewed and updated each quarter. If during the course ofthe six-month review period there is evidence supporting a meaningful decline in the value of collateral, a new appraisal is required to support the value of the impaired loan. With an immaterial number of exceptions, all appraisals and internalreviews are current under this methodology at December 31, 2011.    To determine the general allocated component of theallowance for loan losses, we segregate loans by originating line of business and vintage (transformational and legacy) for reserve purposes because of observable similarities in the performance experience of loansunderwritten by these business units. In general, loans originated by the business units that existed prior to the strategic changes of the Company in 2007 are considered legacy loans. Loans originated by a business unit that wasestablished in connection with or following the strategic business transformation plan are considered transformational loans. Renewals or restructurings of legacy loans may continue to be evaluated as legacy loans depending on thestructure or defining characteristics of the new transaction. The Company has implemented a line of business model that has reorganized the legacy business units so that after 2009, all new loan originations are considered transformational.   The methodology produces an estimated range of potential loss exposure for the product types within each originating line ofbusiness. We consider the appropriate balance of the general allocated component of the reserve within these ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by thebasic allowance framework as well as market and economic data and management judgment. In certain instances, these additional factors and judgments may lead to managements conclusion that the appropriate level of the reserve is outside therange determined through the basic allowance framework.    Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective, as itrequires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, risk ratings, product type, and vintage, as well asconsideration of current economic trends and portfolio attributes, all of which may be susceptible to significant change.   Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged-off arecredited to the allowance. A provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for       75     loan losses to a level that, in managements judgment, is appropriate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.   Goodwill and Intangible Assets    Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lackphysical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability.   Goodwill is allocated to reporting units at acquisition. Subsequently, goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is tested atthe reporting unit level at least an annually for impairment or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In the eventthat we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired, a noncash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded in earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible or regulatory capital.   The impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit. In step one, thefair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value. Our step one calculation of each reporting units fair value is based upon a simple average of two metrics: (1) a primary market approach, which measures fair valuebased upon trading multiples of independent publicly traded financial institutions of comparable size and character to the reporting units, and (2) an income approach, which estimates fair value based upon discounted cash flows(DCF) and terminal value (using the perpetuity growth method). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and step two is not considered necessary. If the carryingvalue of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the impairment test continues (step two) by comparing the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill isdetermined using the residual approach, where the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reportingunit, calculated in step one, is the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge isrecognized to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.    Goodwill impairmenttesting is considered a critical accounting estimate as estimates and assumptions are made about future performance and cash flows, as well as other prevailing market factors. For our annual impairment testing, we engage an independentvaluation firm to assist in the computation of the fair value estimates of each reporting unit as part of its impairment assessment. In connection with obtaining an independent third-party valuation, management provides certain information andassumptions that are utilized in the DCF and implied fair value calculations. Assumptions critical to the process include: forecasted cash flows, which are developed for each segment by considering several key business drivers such as historicalperformance, forward interest rates (using forward interest rate curves to forecast future expected interest rates), anticipated loan and deposit growth, and industry and economic trends; discount rates; and credit quality assessments, among otherconsiderations. We provide the best information available at the time to be used in these estimates and calculations.    In ourannual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 31, 2011, the Company determined that the Trust and Investments reporting unit passed (the fair value exceeded the carrying amount) step one of the goodwill impairment test, whilethe Banking reporting unit failed step one of the impairment test. As a result of the step one procedures performed, the Banking reporting units adjusted net book value exceeded its fair value by approximately $45.9 million. However, theCompany determined that no goodwill impairment charge was necessary based on the implied fair value adjustments of the Banking reporting units assets and liabilities determined in the step two valuation procedures. As a result of the step twoprocedures performed, the implied fair value of the Banking reporting units goodwill exceeded its carrying amount by approximately $90.4 million.    Identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and aresubject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During 2011, there were no events or circumstances to indicate that there may be impairment of intangible assets. Allof the other intangible assets have finite lives which are amortized over varying periods not exceeding 15 years and include core deposit premiums, client relationship, and assembled workforce intangibles, which are amortized on a straight linebasis.    Income Taxes    The determination of income tax expense or benefit, and the amounts of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on complex analyses of many factors, including interpretation offederal and state income tax laws, current financial accounting standards, the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities (temporary differences), assessments of the likelihood that the reversals of deferreddeductible temporary differences will yield tax benefits, and estimates of reserves required for tax uncertainties. In addition, for interim reporting purposes, management generally determines its income tax provision, exclusive of any discreteitems, based on its current best estimate of pre-tax income, permanent differences and the resulting effective tax rate expected for the full year.    We are subject to the federal income tax laws of the United States and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business. We periodically undergo examination by variousgovernmental taxing authorities. Such authorities may require that changes in the amount of tax expense be recognized when their interpretations of tax law differ from those of management, based on      76     their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions, new interpretations of existing lawor positions by federal or state taxing authorities, will not result in tax liability amounts that differ from our current assessment of such amounts, the impact of which could be significant to future results.   Temporary differences may give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of FinancialCondition. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods based on weighing both positive and negative evidence and establish a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets for which recovery is unlikely,based on a standard of more likely than not. In making this assessment, we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize these assets through: (a) the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences,(b) future taxable income, (c) the possible application of future tax planning strategies, and (d) carryback to taxable income in prior years. We have not established a valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets atDecember 31, 2011. However, there is no guarantee that the tax benefits associated with these deferred tax assets will be fully realized. We have concluded, as of December 31, 2011, that it is more likely than not that such tax benefitswill be realized.    In the preparation of income tax returns, tax positions are taken based on interpretation of federal andstate income tax laws for which the outcome of such positions may not be certain. We periodically review and evaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for tax benefits that may not be realized. The amount of anysuch reserves are based on the standards for determining such reserves as set forth in current accounting guidance and our estimates of amounts that may ultimately be due or owed (including interest). These estimates may change from time to timebased on our evaluation of developments subsequent to the filing of the income tax return, such as tax authority audits, court decisions or other tax law interpretations. There can be no assurance that any tax reserves will be sufficient to covertax liabilities that may ultimately be determined to be owed. At December 31, 2011, we had $454,000 of tax reserves established relating to uncertain tax positions that would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognizedin future periods.

Fair Value Measurements    Certain of the Companys assets andliabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting date, including securities available for sale, derivatives, and certain loans held for sale. Additionally, other assets are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates,including goodwill and other intangible assets, assets acquired in business combinations, impaired loans, and OREO.    TheCompany measures fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.   U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes fair value measurements based on the observability of thevaluation inputs used in determining fair value. Level 1 valuations are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 valuations are based on quoted prices for similar instruments, quoted prices inmarkets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 valuations use at least one significant unobservable input that is supported by little or no market activity.   Judgment is required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are included in Level 2 or Level 3. When making thisjudgment, we consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. Classification of Level 2 or Level 3is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputsare considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3.    Judgment is also required when determining the fairvalue of an asset or liability when either relevant observable inputs do not exist or available observable inputs are in a market that is not active. When relevant observable inputs are not available, the Company must use its own assumptions aboutfuture cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates. Conversely, in some cases observable inputs may require significant adjustments. For example, in cases where the volume and level of trading activity in an asset or liability havedeclined significantly, the available prices vary significantly over time or among market participants, or the prices are not current, the observable inputs may not be relevant and could require adjustment.   Valuation techniques and models used to measure the fair value of financial instruments on a recurring basis are reviewed and validatedby the Company on at least a quarterly basis. The Company uses a variety of methods to validate the overall reasonableness of the fair values obtained from external sources, including evaluating pricing service inputs and methodologies, usingexception       77     reports based on analytical criteria, comparing prices obtained to prices received from other pricing sources, and reviewing the reasonableness of prices based on Company knowledge of marketliquidity and other market-related conditions.    The Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent withthose of other market participants. However, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Imprecision inestimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of income or loss recorded for a particular position.    Additionalinformation regarding fair value measurements is included in Note 20 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    As a continuing part of our financial strategy and in accordance with our asset/liability management policies, we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interestincome. This effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield. Our asset/liability management policies also authorize us to enter into derivative instruments as a tool tofurther manage the interest rate exposure of the Banks balance sheet. We may manage interest rate risk by structuring the asset and liability characteristics of our balance sheet and/or by executing derivatives designated as accounting hedges.   Interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. There are otherfactors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our Consolidated Statements of Income.    In July 2011, we initiated the use of interest rate derivatives as part of our asset liability management strategy to hedge interest rate risk in our primarily floating-rate loan portfolio and, dependingon market conditions; we may expand this program and enter into additional interest rate swaps.    The majority of ourinterest-earning assets are floating rate instruments. To manage the interest rate risk of our balance sheet, we have the ability to use a combination of financial instruments, including medium-term and short-term financings, variable-rate debtinstruments, fixed rate loans and securities and interest rate swaps. Approximately 61% of the total loan portfolio is indexed to LIBOR, 21% of the total loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate, and another 8% of the total loan portfoliootherwise adjusts with other reference interest rates. Of the $5.6 billion in loans maturity after one year with a floating interest rate, 25% are subject to interest rate floors under the terms of the loan agreements, the majority of which are ineffect at December 31, 2011 and are reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis below. Changes in market rates and the shape of the yield curve may give us the opportunity to make changes to our investment securities portfolio as part of ourasset/liability management strategy.    We use a simulation model to estimate the potential impact of various interest ratechanges on our income statement and our interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability portfolios, assuming the size and nature of these portfolios remain constant throughout the twelve month measurement period. The simulation assumes thatassets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis. Assets and liabilities then re-price based on current terms and assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in the applicable yield curves and remain at that new interest rate throughthe end of the measurement period. The model attempts to illustrate the potential change in annual net interest income if the foregoing occurred. The following table shows the estimated impact of an immediate change in interest rates as ofDecember 31, 2011 and 2010.

As an example, this table illustrates that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of +100 basis points on December 31,       78     2011, net interest income would increase by $33.3 million, or 8.7%, over a twelve-month period, as compared to a net interest income increase of $25.1 million, or 6.5%, if there had been aninstantaneous parallel shift of +100 basis points at December 31, 2010.    Changes in the effect on net interest income atDecember 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 are due to changes in the composition and nature of the repricing of interest rate-sensitive assets relative to rate-sensitive liabilities since year end 2010. Interest rate sensitivityincreased during 2011 due to several factors, primarily liability compositional changes. Non-interest sensitive deposits increased while rate sensitive deposits, such as money market deposits, decreased. Rate-sensitive liabilities mitigaterate-sensitive assets. Accordingly, as rate-sensitive liabilities decrease, less asset sensitivity is offset by the liabilities as a whole. Taken together, the asset composition was more rate sensitive than in the prior year, and less of the assetsensitivity was mitigated by rate-sensitive liabilities, producing an overall increase in asset sensitivity. This effect was partially mitigated by the hedging program established in 2011.   The preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels includingthe shape of the yield curve, prepayments on loans and securities, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others. While our assumptions are developed based upon current economic andlocal market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change.    ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    The Board of Directors and Shareholders of PrivateBancorp, Inc.:    We have auditedthe accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of PrivateBancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the threeyears in the period ended December 31, 2011. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts anddisclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our auditsprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.    In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in allmaterial respects, the consolidated financial position of PrivateBancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the periodended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    Nature of Operations   PrivateBancorp, Inc. (PrivateBancorp or the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in 1989 and became a holding company registered under the BankHolding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The PrivateBank and Trust Company (PrivateBank-Chicago, PrivateBank, or the Bank), the sole banking subsidiary of PrivateBancorp, was opened in Chicago in 1991. The Companycompleted its initial public offering in June of 1999. The Bank provides customized business and personal financial services to middle market companies and business owners, executives, entrepreneurs and families in seven geographic markets in theMidwest, as well as Denver and Atlanta. The majority of the Banks business is conducted in the greater Chicago market.   Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include theaccounts and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, a controlling financial interest. In consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts andtransactions are eliminated. Investments in unconsolidated entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions. Investments thatdo not meet the criteria for equity method accounting are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Assets held in a fiduciary or agency capacity are not assets of the Company or its subsidiaries and, accordingly, are not included in theconsolidated financial statements.    The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and general practice within the banking industry. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. We use the accrual basisof accounting for financial reporting purposes.    In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we have considered theimpact of events occurring subsequent to December 31, 2011 for potential recognition or disclosure in this annual report on Form 10-K.    Business Combinations   Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets and liabilities of the business acquired arerecorded at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition, with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Results of operations ofthe acquired business are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the effective date of acquisition.    Use ofEstimates   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanyingnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies adhered to in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, management has defined cash and cashequivalents to include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and other short-term investments. Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods, but not longer than 30 days. Short-term investments generally mature in less than 30 days.All cash and cash equivalents have maturities of three months or less.    Investment Securities   At the time ofpurchase, debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturitysecurities are carried at amortized cost. Securities are classified as available-for-sale when management has the intent and ability to hold such securities for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sellavailable-for-sale securities would be based on various factors, including, but not limited to asset/liability management strategies, changes in interest rates or prepayment risks, liquidity needs, or regulatory capital considerations.Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income (OCI).   The historical cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts over the estimated life of thesecurity, using the level-yield method. Amortization of premium and accretion of discount are included in interest income from the related security.    Purchases and sales of securities are recognized on a trade date basis. Realized securities gains or losses are reported in net securities gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The costof securities sold is based on the specific identification method. On       86     a quarterly basis, we make an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or circumstances to indicate that a security for which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on another-than-temporary (OTTI) basis. This determination requires significant judgment. OTTI is considered to have occurred (1) if management intends to sell the security; (2) if it is more likely than not we will be required tosell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) if the present value of the expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For debt securities that we do not expect to sell or for whichit is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell prior to recovery, the OTTI is separated into credit and noncredit components. The credit-related OTTI, represented by the expected loss in principal, is recognized innon-interest income, while noncredit-related OTTI is recognized in OCI. Noncredit-related OTTI results from other factors, including increased liquidity spreads and changes in risk-free interest rates. All of the OTTI is recognized in earnings forsecurities we expect to sell. Presentation of OTTI is made in the income statement on a gross basis with a reduction for the amount of OTTI recognized in OCI. Once an OTTI is recorded, future significant increases in expected cash flows are treatedas prospective yield adjustments.    Non-marketable equity securities are carried at cost. Impairment testing on theseinvestments is based on applicable accounting guidance and the cost basis is reduced when impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary.    Loans Held for Sale   Loans held for sale (LHFS) represent mortgage loan originations intended to be sold in the secondary market and other loans that management has an active planto sell. LHFS are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined on an individual asset basis or carried at fair value where the Company has elected fair value accounting. Beginning on August 1, 2011, the Company elected to measureresidential mortgage loans originated as held for sale under the fair value option on a prospective basis. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these LHFS are recognized in other income, service charges and fees in the Consolidated Statementsof Income. Mortgage loan origination costs related to LHFS which the Company accounts for under the fair value option are recognized in noninterest expense as incurred. Held for investment loans that have been transferred to LHFS are carried at thelower of cost or fair value. For these LHFS, any decreases in value below cost are recognized in mortgage banking revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income and increases in fair value above cost are not recognized until the loans are sold.The credit component of any write down upon transfer to LHFS is reflected in charge-offs to the allowance for loan losses. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying amount ofthe loans and recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking revenue upon the sale of such loans.    Fair value is determinedbased on quoted market rates and our judgment of relevant market conditions. Gains and losses on the disposition of loans held for sale are determined on the specific identification method. Mortgage loans sold in the secondary market are soldwithout retaining servicing rights.    Originated Loans Held for Investment   Originated loans held for investmentare carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income, deferred loan fees or costs, and any direct principal charge-offs. Interest income on loans is accrued based on principal amounts outstanding. Loan origination fees, fees forcommitments that are expected to be exercised and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net amount is amortized over the life of the related loan or commitment period as a yield adjustment. Other credit-related fees arerecognized as fee income when earned.    Delinquent and Nonaccrual Loans   Loans are considered past due ordelinquent if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payment is due. Generally, loans (including impaired loans) are placed on nonaccrual status: (a) when either principal or interest paymentsare 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms; or (b) when an individual analysis of a borrowers creditworthiness indicates a loan should be placed on nonaccrual status rather than waiting until the loan becomes 90 days pastdue. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, accrued and unpaid interest credited to income is reversed and accretion of net deferred loan fees ceases. Subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, andinterest income may only be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest payments become current in accordance with the termsof the loan agreement and when the financial position of the borrower and other relevant factors indicate there is no longer doubt as to such collectability.    Impaired Loans   Impaired loans consist of nonaccrual loans (which include nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings (TDRs)) and loans classified as accruing TDRs. A loan isconsidered impaired when, based on current information and events, management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the original contractual terms of the loanagreement. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the loans observable fair value, the fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral-dependent, or thepresent value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate.    If the measurement of theimpaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by creating a specific valuation reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans exceeding $500,000 are evaluated individually, whilesmaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience, as well as managements loss expectations, for the respective asset class and product type.       87     Impaired loans with specific reserves are reviewed quarterly for any changes that wouldaffect the specific reserve. Any impaired loan for which a determination has been made that the economic value is permanently reduced is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses to reflect its current economic value in the period in whichthe determination has been made.    At the time a collateral-dependent loan is initially determined to be impaired, we reviewthe existing collateral appraisal. If the most recent appraisal is greater than a year old, a new appraisal is obtained on the underlying collateral. Appraisals for loans in excess of $500,000 are updated with a new independent appraisal at leastannually and are formally reviewed by our internal appraisal department upon receipt of a new appraisal as well as at the six-month interval between the independent appraisals. All impaired loans and their related reserves are reviewed and updatedeach quarter. If during the course of the six-month review period there is evidence supporting a meaningful decline in the value of collateral, a new appraisal is required to support the value of the impaired loan. With an immaterial number ofexceptions, all appraisals and internal reviews are current under this methodology at December 31, 2011.   Restructured Loans    Loans may be modified in the normal course of business for competitive reasons or tostrengthen the Companys position. Loan modifications and restructurings may also occur when the borrower experiences financial difficulty and needs temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the loan. Thesemodifications are structured on a loan-by-loan basis, and depending on the circumstances, may include extensions of maturity dates, rate reductions, forgiveness of principal, or other concessions. The Company may also utilize a multiple notestructure as a workout alternative for certain loans. The multiple note structure typically bifurcates a troubled loan into two separate notes, where the first note is reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to the modified terms,and the portion of the troubled loan that is not reasonably assured of repayment is charged-off. Loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties, and for which the Company has granted a concessionthat it would not otherwise consider, are considered a TDR.    We consider many factors in determining whether to agree to aloan modification involving concessions, and seek a solution that will both minimize potential loss to the Company and attempt to help the borrower. We evaluate our borrowers current and forecasted future cash flows, their ability andwillingness to make current contractual or proposed modified payments, the value of the underlying collateral (if applicable), the possibility of obtaining additional security or guarantees, and the potential costs related to a repossession orforeclosure and the subsequent sale of the collateral.    Restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, movingto nonaccrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured remains on nonaccrual for a period of at least six months to ensure that theborrower performs in accordance with the restructured terms including consistent and timely loan payments. However, the borrowers performance prior to the restructuring or other significant events at the time of the restructuring may beconsidered in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual status after a shorter performance period or concurrent with the restructuring. In such situations, the loan will be reported asa restructured loan accruing interest. If the borrowers performance under the new terms is not reasonably assured, the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan.   The allowance for loan losses on restructured loans is determined by discounting the restructured cash flows by the original effectiverate, or if collateral-dependent, by obtaining an appraisal.    Allowance for Loan Losses   We maintain an allowancefor loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio ateach balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time. The allowance consists of provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are individuallyevaluated for impairment (the specific component), as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio that are not specifically identified (the general allocated component), which is determined using a methodology thatis a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio as well as managements judgment.    The specific component relates to impaired loans. Impaired loans consist of nonaccrual loans (which include nonaccrual TDRs) and loans classified as accruing TDRs. See Impaired Loans sectionof this Note 1 for detailed discussion of the specific component of the allowance for loan losses.    To determine the generalallocated component of the allowance for loan losses, we segregate loans by originating line of business and vintage (transformational and legacy) for reserve purposes because of observable similarities in the performanceexperience of loans underwritten by these business units. In general, loans originated by the business units that existed prior to the strategic changes of the Company in 2007 are considered legacy loans. Loans originated by a businessunit that was established in connection with or following the strategic business transformation plan are considered transformational loans. Renewals or restructurings of legacy loans may continue to be evaluated as legacy loans dependingon the structure or defining characteristics of the new transaction. The       88     Company has implemented a line of business model that has reorganized the legacy business units so that after 2009, all new loan originations are considered transformational.   The methodology produces an estimated range of potential loss exposure for the product types within each originating line of business. Weconsider the appropriate balance of the general allocated component of the reserve within these ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by the basic allowanceframework as well as market and economic data and management judgment. In certain instances, these additional factors and judgments may lead to managements conclusion that the appropriate level of the reserve is outside the range determinedthrough the basic allowance framework.    The product segments we evaluate in the general reserve methodology are commercialloans, commercial real estate loans, constructions loans and consumer loans (which include personal loans, residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit). Our commercial loan portfolio includes lines of credit to businesses, term loansand letters of credit. Certain non-residential owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are also included in our commercial loan portfolio where the cash flows from the owners business serve as the primary source of loan repayment.Commercial loans contain risks unique to the business and market of each borrower and the repayment is dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower.    Commercial real estate loans are comprised of loans secured by various types of collateral including 1-4 family non-owner occupied housing units located primarily in our target market areas, multi-familyreal estate, office buildings, warehouses, retail space, mixed use buildings, and vacant land, the bulk of which is held for long-term investment or development. Risks inherent in real estate lending are related to the market value of the propertytaken as collateral, the underlying cash flows and the general economic condition of the market in which the collateral is located. Repayment is generally dependent on the ability of the borrower to attract tenants at rental rates that provide fordebt service. Repayment of commercial real estate loans is also somewhat dependent on long term financing options available to the borrower.    Our construction loan portfolio consists of single-family residential properties, multi-family properties, and commercial projects, and includes both investment properties and properties that will beowner-occupied. Risks inherent in construction lending are similar to those in commercial real estate lending. Additional risks include the cost and time frame of constructing or improving a property, the borrowers inability to use fundsgenerated by a project to service a loan until a project is completed, the more pronounced risk to interest rate movements and the real estate market that these borrowers face while a project is being completed or seeking a buyer and theavailability of permanent financing. Because of the nature of construction loans, as a product segment, these loans have the highest inherent risk in our portfolio and are often the highest yielding loans in our portfolio.   Consumer loans are a smaller portion of our overall portfolio and consist of residential home mortgages, home equity lines of credit andpersonal loans. The risk issues associated with these products are closely correlated to the U.S. housing market and the local markets in which the collateral resides and include home price indices, sales volume, unemployment rates, vacancy rates,foreclosure rates, loan to value ratios, and delinquency rates. Some personal loans may be unsecured.    Determination of theallowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, riskratings, product type, and vintage, as well as consideration of current economic trends and portfolio attributes, all of which may be susceptible to significant change.    Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan losses, which is acharge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in managements judgment, is appropriate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.   Reserve for Unfunded Commitments   We maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient toabsorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities. The reserve is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The reserve is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determinethe general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses and is based on a model which uses recent commitment utilization patterns at the product level as a method of predicting future usage across the portfolio. Net adjustments to thereserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.   Purchased Loans   Purchased loans acquired through portfolio purchases or in a business combination are accounted for underspecialized accounting guidance when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration at the time of acquisition and for which it is probable that not all contractual payments will be collected (purchased impaired loans). Evidence ofcredit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, declines in current borrower FICO scores,       89     geographic concentration and declines in current loan-to-value ratios. U.S. GAAP requires these loans to be recorded at fair value at acquisition date and prohibits the carrying overor the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting for loans acquired in a transfer.    The fair values forpurchased impaired loans are determined by discounting cash flows expected to be collected using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fairvalue. We estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition using internal models that incorporate managements best estimate of current key assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and paymentspeeds.    Under the applicable accounting guidance for purchased impaired loans, any excess of cash flows expected atacquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method when there is a reasonable expectation about amountand timing of such cash flows. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. Subsequent decreases in the expectedcash flows will generally result in an allowance for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for losses to the extent of prior charges or an adjustment to the accretable yield. Purchased impaired loanswith common risk characteristics are accounted for on a pool basis as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Because we are recognizing interest income on each pool of loans, they are allconsidered to be performing.    U.S. GAAP requires purchased loans not subject to the specialized accounting guidance(purchased non-impaired loans) to be recorded at fair value at acquisition date and prohibits the carrying over or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting for loans acquired in a transfer. Differencesbetween the purchase price and the unpaid principal balance at the date of acquisition are recorded in interest income over the life of the loan. Decreases in expected cash flows after the purchase date are recognized by recording an allowance forloan losses.    Covered Assets   Purchased loans and foreclosed loan collateral covered under loss sharing orsimilar credit protection agreements with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are reported separately on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition inclusive of the fair value of reimbursement cash flowsthe Company expects to receive from the FDIC under those agreements. Similarly, the provision for covered loan losses is recorded net of the expected reimbursement from the FDIC.   Other Real Estate Owned   Other real estate owned (OREO) is comprised of property acquired through foreclosureproceedings or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in partial or total satisfaction of certain loans. Properties are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan at the time of acquisition or the fair value, determined on thebasis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Any write-downs in the carrying value of a property at the time of acquisition arecharged against the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent write-downs to reflect current fair value, as well as gains or losses on disposition and revenues or expenses incurred in maintaining such properties are treated as period costs andreported in non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Depreciable Assets   Premises,furniture and equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is determined by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortizedon a straight-line basis over the shorter of the life of the asset or the lease term. Rates of depreciation are generally based on the following useful lives: buildings, 30-40 years; leasehold improvements, typically 1-16 years; and furniture andequipment including software, 3-7 years. Gains on dispositions are included in other income, and losses on dispositions are included in other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expensesas incurred, while improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining life.    Long-lived depreciable assets are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the expectedundiscounted future cash flows of a long-lived asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset based on a quotedmarket price, if applicable, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses are recorded in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI)   BOLI represents life insurance policies on the lives of certain Company officers for which the Company is the beneficiary. These policies arerecorded as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at their cash surrender value, or the amount that could be realized currently. The change in cash surrender value and insurance proceeds received are recorded as BOLI incomein non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   Goodwillrepresents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but      90     can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a relatedcontract, asset, or liability.    Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level at least annually for impairment or more oftenif an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company has determined that its operating segments qualify as reporting units underU.S. GAAP. In step one of the impairment testing process, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value. Our step one calculation of each reporting units fair value is based upon a simple average oftwo metrics: (1) a primary market approach, which measures fair value based upon trading multiples of independent publicly traded financial institutions of comparable size and character to the reporting units, and (2) an income approach,which estimates fair value based upon discounted cash flows and terminal value (using the perpetuity growth method). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and step two isnot considered necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the impairment test continues (step two) by comparing the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value ofgoodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined using the residual approach, where the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a businesscombination and the fair value of the reporting unit, calculated in step one, is the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the impliedfair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.    Identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and aresubject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All of the Companys other intangible assets have finite lives and are amortized over varying periods notexceeding 15 years.    Fiduciary Assets and Assets Under Management   Assets held in a fiduciary capacity forclients are not included in the consolidated financial statements as they are not assets of the Company or its subsidiaries. Fiduciary and asset management fees are generally determined based upon market values of assets under management as of aspecified date during the period and are included as a component of non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.   Advertising Costs   All advertising costs are expensed in the period they are incurred.   Loss Contingencies   Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, arerecorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.   Derivative Instruments   We utilize an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instrumentsthat are not designated in hedge relationships to reduce interest rate risk, as it relates to mortgage loan commitments and planned sales, and foreign currency volatility. We also use derivative instruments that are not designated in hedgerelationships for client accommodation as we provide derivative risk management solutions for our clients. Additionally, we use interest rate derivatives designated in cash flow hedge relationships to hedge interest rate risk in our loan portfoliothat is comprised primarily of floating rate loans.    All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the ConsolidatedStatements of Financial Condition, after considering the effects of master netting agreements as allowed under authoritative accounting guidance.    On the date we enter into a derivative contract, we designate the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or as a freestanding derivative instrument. Derivative instrumentsdesignated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered to be fair value hedges. Derivative instruments designated ina hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows to be received or paid related to an asset or liability or other types of forecasted transactions are considered to be cash flow hedges. We formally document allrelationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.    For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge and are effective, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged itemattributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on thederivative instrument is reported as a component of OCI. The unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For all hedge relationships, derivative gains andlosses not effective in hedging the change in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of change. For derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship, changes in fairvalue are reported in current earnings during the period of change.       91     At the hedges inception and at least quarterly thereafter, a formal assessment isperformed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highlyeffective in the future. If a derivative instrument designated as a hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively and the gain or loss is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of thehedged asset or liability (fair value hedge) or over the same period(s) that the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings (cash flow hedge). If the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, the gain or loss is included inearnings immediately.    See Note 18 for additional information on derivative instruments.   Income Taxes   The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax return. The provision for income taxesis based on income reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, rather than amounts reported on our income tax return.   We recognize a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences.Temporary differences include differences between financial statement income and tax return income that are expected to reverse in future periods, as well as differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities thatare also expected to be settled in future periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that we expect will apply when the differences are reversed or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reducedeferred tax assets to the amount management concludes is more likely than not to be realized.    We periodically review andevaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for tax benefits that may not be realized. Any income tax-related interest and penalties are included in income tax expense.   Net Earnings Per Common Share   Basic income (loss) per common share is calculated using the two-class method. The two-classmethod is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each share of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared (distributed earnings) and participation rights in undistributed earnings.Distributed and undistributed earnings are allocated between common and participating security stockholders based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends ordividend equivalents are considered participating securities (i.e., the Companys deferred stock units and nonvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, excluding certain awards with forfeitable rights to dividends).Undistributed net losses are not allocated to holders of participating securities, as they do not have a contractual obligation to fund the losses incurred by the Company. Net income (loss) attributable to common shares is then divided by theweighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, net of participating securities.    Diluted income(loss) per common share considers common stock issuable under the assumed release of nonvested restricted stock awards and units with forfeitable dividend rights and the assumed exercise of stock options granted under the Companys stock plansas well as the assumed exercise of a warrant related to the United States Treasury (U.S. Treasury) under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program (CPP) (potentially dilutive common stockequivalents). Diluted income (loss) attributable to common shares is then divided by the total of weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period, net of participating securities. Potentiallydilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated under the more dilutive of either thetreasury method or the two-class method. See Note 14 for additional information.    Treasury Stock   Treasury stockacquired is recorded at cost and is carried as a reduction of equity on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.   Share-Based Compensation   Share-based compensation cost is recognized as expense for stock options, restricted stock awards,restricted stock units, and deferred stock units issued to employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A binomial option-pricing model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options,while the closing market price of the Companys common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and deferred stock units. The costs are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over therequisite service period, generally defined as the vesting period for the awards. When an award is granted to an employee who is retirement eligible or who will become retirement eligible prior to the end of the service period and will continue tovest after retirement, the compensation cost of these awards is recognized over the period up to the date an employee first becomes eligible to retire. The amortization of share-based compensation generally reflects estimated forfeitures adjustedfor actual forfeiture experience. As compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. However, in cases in which a future taxdeduction will not be allowed because of TARP-related compensation restrictions, a deferred tax asset is not recorded. At the time share-based awards are exercised, cancelled, expire, or restrictions are released, we may be required to recognize anadjustment to       92     stockholders equity or income tax expense, depending on the market price of the Companys stock at that time and the amount of the deferred tax asset relating to such awards.Share-based compensation expense is included in salaries and wages in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    For additionaldetails on our share-based compensation plans, refer to Notes 15 and 16.    Comprehensive Income   Comprehensiveincome consists of two components, reported net income and OCI. OCI refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that are recorded as an element of equity but are excluded from reported net income. OCI consists of unrealized gains (losses) onsecurities available-for-sale and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated in cash flow hedges, net of tax.    Preferred Stock   Preferred stock ranks senior to common stock with respect to dividends and has preference in the event of liquidation. The shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferredstock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock) issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP CPP of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the warrant issued under the CPP are accounted for as permanent equity on the ConsolidatedStatements of Financial Condition. The proceeds received were allocated between the Series B Preferred Stock and the warrant based upon their relative fair values as of the date of issuance, which resulted in the recording of a discount on theSeries B Preferred Stock upon issuance that reflects the value allocated to the warrant. The discount is accreted by a charge to retained earnings using the effective interest method over the expected life of the preferred stock of five years.   The Series B Preferred Stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per annum until the fifth anniversary of the dateof issuance, and thereafter at a rate of 9% per annum. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears and accrued as earned over the period the Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding. Preferred dividends paid (declared and accrued) and the relatedaccretion is deducted from net income for computing income available to common stockholders and earnings per share computations.    Segment Disclosures   An operating segment is a component of a business that (i) engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses; (ii) has operatingresults that are reviewed regularly by the entitys chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and (iii) has discrete financial information available. Ourchief operating decision maker evaluates the operations of the Company under three operating segments: Banking, Trust and Investments, and Holding Company. Refer to Note 21 for additional disclosure regarding the performance of our operatingsegments.    Variable Interest Entities   A variable interest entity (VIE) is a partnership, limitedliability company, trust, or other legal entity that does not have sufficient equity to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whose investors lack one of three characteristicsassociated with owning a controlling financial interest. Those characteristics are: (i) the power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economicperformance, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity; and (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity.    U.S. GAAP requires VIEs to be consolidated by the party that has a controlling financial interest in the VIE (i.e., the primary beneficiary). The Company is deemed to have a controlling financial interestand is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that couldpotentially be significant to the VIE.         2.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    Disclosures on Loan Credit Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses   On December 31, 2010, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board(FASB) related to improving disclosures about an entitys allowance for loan losses and the credit quality of its loans. The guidance requires additional disclosure to facilitate financial statement users evaluation of thefollowing: (1) the nature of credit risk inherent in the entitys loan portfolio, (2) how that risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for loan losses, and (3) the changes and reasons for those changes in theallowance for loan losses. This guidance was effective for the Companys financial statements as of December 31, 2010, as it relates to disclosures required as of the end of a reporting period. Disclosures that relate to activity during areporting period became effective for the Companys financial statements beginning on January 1, 2011. Since the new guidance only affects disclosures, it did not impact our financial position and consolidated results of operations uponadoption.       93     Fair Value Measurement Disclosures   On January 1, 2011, we adopted theadditional disclosure requirements that had a delayed effective date under the new accounting guidance issued by the FASB in January 2010 regarding separate presentation of information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements for Level 3fair value measurements. As this guidance only affects disclosures, the adoption of this guidance did not impact our financial position and consolidated results of operations.    Troubled Debt Restructurings   On July 1, 2011, we adopted new guidance related to a creditors accounting for TDRs, as well as new disclosure requirements related to TDRs. Theguidance clarifies whether a modification of a loan receivable constitutes a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty. The guidance and disclosures were effective for the Companys financial statements that includeperiods beginning on or after July 1, 2011, with retrospective application to the Companys annual reporting period beginning on January 1, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial positionand consolidated results of operations.    Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption   Transfers and Servicing   On April 29, 2011, the FASB issued amendments to its accounting guidance on the effectivecontrol assessment for repurchase agreements that in part determines whether a transaction is accounted for as a sale or a secured borrowing. The amendments remove from the assessment of effective control: (1) the criterion requiring thetransferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and (2) the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion.The guidance will be effective for the Companys financial statements that include periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position andconsolidated results of operations.    Fair Value Measurement   On May 12, 2011, the FASB issued amendments toits fair value measurement guidance. The amendments substantially converge the principles for measuring fair value and the requirements for related disclosures under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendments includeclarifications and new guidance related to the highest and best use and valuation premise, measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in shareholders equity, measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are managed within aportfolio, and the application of block discounts and other premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement. The amendments also require additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance will be effective for the Companysfinancial statements that include periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and consolidated results of operations.   Statement of Comprehensive Income   On June 16, 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of the statement ofcomprehensive income and in addition provided further clarifying guidance on presentation requirements on December 23, 2011. This guidance provides the Company the option of presenting net income and other comprehensive income in one continuousstatement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments do not change what items are reported in other comprehensive income. The guidance will be effective for the Companys financial statements thatinclude periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012 and must be retrospectively applied. As this guidance affects only our presentation of the statement of comprehensive income, the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact onour financial position and consolidated results of operations.    Testing Goodwill for Impairment   OnSeptember 15, 2011, the FASB issued guidance that permits the Company to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value before applying the existingtwo-step goodwill impairment test. If the Company concludes that this is the case, the Company would proceed with the existing two-step test, whereby the Company would quantitatively determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less thanits carrying value, and if so, measure the amount of any goodwill impairment. Otherwise, the Company would be able to bypass the two-step test and conclude that goodwill is not impaired from a qualitative perspective. The guidance will be effectivefor the Companys financial statements that include periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial position and consolidated results of operations.   Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities   On December 16, 2011, the FASB issued guidance to enhance currentdisclosure requirements on offsetting financial assets and liabilities. The new disclosure requirements are limited to recognized financial instruments subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements. At a minimum, the Company will berequired to disclose the following information separately for financial assets and liabilities: (a) the gross amounts of recognized financial assets and liabilities, (b) the amounts offset under current U.S. GAAP, (c) the net amountspresented in the balance sheet, (d) the amounts subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement that were not included in (b), and (e) the difference between (c) and (d). The guidance will be effective forthe Companys financial statements that include periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and must be retrospectively applied. As this guidance affects only our disclosures, the adoption of this guidance will not have a materialimpact on our financial position and consolidated results of operations.       94       3.

This equity security is restricted in that it can only be sold to the FHLB or another member institution at par. Therefore, it is less liquid than otherequity securities. The fair value is estimated to be cost, and no other-than-temporary impairments have been recorded on this security during 2011 and 2010.    The carrying value of securities pledged to secure public deposits, trust deposits, derivative transactions with counterparty banks, standby letters of credit with counterparty banks and for otherpurposes as permitted or required by law, totaled $514.6 million and $656.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The decrease in unrealized losses from the prior year for agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations, agency backed residential mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal securities were caused primarily by decreases ininterest rates and tightening of credit spreads.    The unrealized losses on these securities as of December 31, 2011 areattributable to changes in interest rates, and because we do not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be atmaturity, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.       96     Remaining Contractual Maturity of Securities   (Amounts in thousands)                                   December 31, 2011            Available-For-Sale              Held-To-Maturity and Non-Marketable Equity Investments            Amortized Cost        Fair         Value                          Amortized     Cost        Fair Value        U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agencies, state and municipals and foreign sovereign debt securities                                 One year or less      $  1,942           $  1,953               $  23           $  23          One year to five years        98,608             101,421                 48             48          Five years to ten years        102,932             111,942                 -             -          After ten years        21,702             22,936                 -             -          All other securities                                 Collateralized mortgage obligations        344,078             356,000                 -             -          Residential mortgage-backed securities        1,140,555             1,189,213                 490,072             493,159          Non-marketable equity investments        -             -                 43,604             43,604                                                                                Total      $      1,709,817           $    1,783,465               $      533,747           $      536,834                                                                               Securities Gains (Losses)    (Amounts in thousands)                             Years ended December 31,            2011        2010        2009        Proceeds from sales      $        295,870            $        432,895             $        265,778                Gross realized gains      $  6,300            $  13,469             $  8,527           Gross realized losses        (529)             (1,287)             (1,146)                                                            Net realized gains      $  5,771            $  12,182            $  7,381                                                                  Income tax provision on net realized gains      $  2,295            $  4,669            $  2,826          Refer to Note 13 for additional details of the securities available-for-sale portfolio and the relatedimpact of unrealized gains (losses) on other comprehensive income.       97       4.

As clients, they have had transactions with the Bank, in the ordinary course of business of the Bank, including borrowings, that are or were on substantiallythe same terms (including interest rates and collateral on loans) as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated persons. The Securities and Exchange Commission has determined that, with respect to the Company and itssignificant subsidiaries, expanded disclosure of borrowings by directors and executive officers and certain of their related interests should be made if the loans outstanding are greater than 5% of the issuers stockholders equity, in theaggregate. These loans totaled $11.2 million and $24.7 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were not greater the 5% of stockholders equity at either December 31, 2011 or 2010. Related party credit extensionstotaled $19.3 million and $97.7 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

through 8. Loans rated 5 and better (1-5 ratings, inclusive) are creditsthat exhibit acceptable financial performance, cash flow, and leverage. We attempt to mitigate risk by structure, collateral, monitoring, or other meaningful controls. Credits rated 6 are considered special mention as these credits demonstratepotential weakness that if left unresolved, may result in deterioration in the Companys credit position and/or the repayment prospects for the credit. Borrowers rated special mention may exhibit adverse operating trends, high leverage, tightliquidity or other credit concerns. Potential problem loans are loans that we have identified as performing in       100    accordance with contractual terms, but for which management has some level of concern about the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms in future periods. These loans have arisk rating of 7 but are not classified as nonaccrual. The ultimate collection of these loans is questionable due to the same conditions that characterize a 6-rated credit. These credits may also be considered inadequately protected by the currentnet worth and/or paying capacity of the obligor or guarantors or the collateral pledged. These loans generally have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that may jeopardize collection of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibilitythat the Company will sustain some loss if left unresolved. Although these loans are generally identified as potential problem loans and require additional attention by management, they may never become nonperforming. Nonperforming loans includenonaccrual loans risk rated 7 or 8 and have all the weaknesses inherent in a 7-rated potential problem loan with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently-existing facts,conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Special mention, potential problem and nonperforming loans are reviewed at minimum on a quarterly basis, while all other rated credits over a certain dollar threshold, depending on productsegment, are reviewed annually or as the situation warrants.

At the time an accruing loan becomes modified as a TDR, it is considered impaired and no longer included as part of the general loan lossreserve determination. However, our general reserve methodology may consider the amount and/or characteristics of the TDRs removed as one of many credit or portfolio considerations in establishing final reserve requirements.   Modified loans which meet the definition of a TDR (both accruing and nonaccruing), including those that have payment defaults, areconsidered impaired and, accordingly, the loans are specifically evaluated for impairment at the end of each accounting period with a specific valuation reserve created, if necessary, as a component of the allowance for loan losses. Refer to theImpaired Loan and Allowance for Loan Losses sections of Note 1 regarding our policy for assessing potential impairment on such loans. At December 31, 2011, our allowance for loan losses included $25.7 million in specificreserves for nonaccrual TDRs. There were no specific reserves for accruing TDRs at December 31, 2011.       104    The following table presents the recorded investment and number of loans modified as a TDRduring the previous 12 months which subsequently became nonperforming during the year ended December 31, 2011. A loan becomes nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status typically when the principal or interest payments are 90 days past duebased on contractual terms or when an individual analysis of a borrowers creditworthiness indicates a loan should be placed on nonaccrual status earlier than when the loan becomes 90 days past due.

COVERED ASSETS    In 2009,the Bank acquired certain assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits of the former Founders Bank from the FDIC. Assets totaling approximately $843 million were purchased at a discount of $54 million. The Bank and the FDIC entered into aloss sharing agreement regarding future losses incurred on loans and foreclosed loan collateral existing at the date of acquisition. Under the terms of the loss-sharing agreement, the FDIC generally will assume 80% of the first $173 million ofcredit losses and 95% of the credit losses in excess of $173 million.    As a result of the loss sharing agreement discussedabove, the acquired loans, foreclosed loan collateral and indemnification receivable (representing the present value of the expected reimbursement from the FDIC related to expected losses on the acquired loans and foreclosed real estate under suchagreement) are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as covered assets. The carrying amount of covered assets is presented in the following table.

Because we are recognizing interest income on each pool of loans, all purchased impaired loans are considered to be performing.   At date of purchase, all purchased loans and the related indemnification asset were recorded at fair value.   On an ongoing basis, the accounting for purchased loans and the related indemnification asset follows applicable authoritative accountingguidance for purchased nonimpaired loans and purchased impaired loans. The amounts that we realize on these loans and the related indemnification asset could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in these financial statements, basedupon the timing and amount of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. Our losses on these assets may be mitigated to the extent covered under the specific terms and provisions of any loss share agreements.   The allowance for covered loan losses is determined in a manner consistent with our policy for the originated loan portfolio.

At December 31, 2011, we were obligated under certain non-cancellable operating leasesfor premises and equipment, which expire at various dates through the year 2023. Many of these leases contain renewal options, and certain leases provide options to purchase the leased property during or at the expiration of the lease period atspecific prices. Some leases contain escalation clauses calling for rentals to be adjusted for increased real estate taxes and other operating expenses, or proportionately adjusted for increases in the consumer or other price indices.

In our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 31, 2011, theCompany determined that the Trust and Investments reporting unit passed (the fair value exceeded the carrying amount) step one of the goodwill impairment test, while the Banking reporting unit failed step one of the impairment test. As aresult of the step one procedures performed, the Banking reporting units adjusted net book value exceeded its fair value by approximately $45.9 million. However, the Company determined that no goodwill impairment charge was necessary based onthe implied fair value adjustments of the Banking reporting units assets and liabilities determined in the step two valuation procedures. As a result of the step two procedures performed, the implied fair value of the Banking reportingunits goodwill exceeded its carrying amount by approximately $90.4 million.    There were no impairment charges forgoodwill recorded in 2011, 2010, or 2009. The Company is not aware of any events or circumstances that would result in goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2011.    The reduction in goodwill is due to an adjustment for tax benefits associated with the goodwill attributable to Lodestar Investment Counsel, LLC (Lodestar), an investment management firm andwholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.    We have other intangible assets capitalized on the Consolidated Statements ofFinancial Condition in the form of core deposit premiums, client relationships and an assembled workforce. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 years to 15 years. We review intangibleassets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. During 2011, there were no events or circumstances to indicate there may be impairment of intangible assets, and noimpairment charges for other intangible assets were recorded in 2011, 2010, or 2009.

The Debentures held by the trusts, which totaled $244.8 million, are the sole assets of each trust. Our obligations under the Debentures and related documents, taken together, constitute a full andunconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of the trusts. The guarantee covers the distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of the Trust Preferred Securities, but only to the extent of funds held by the trusts. We havethe right to redeem the Debentures in whole or in part, on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. We may also have the right to redeem the Debentures atan earlier time, if future legislative or regulatory changes impact our capital treatment of the Trust Preferred Securities. We used the proceeds from the sales of the Debentures for general corporate purposes.   Under current accounting rules, the trusts qualify as variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary andtherefore ineligible for consolidation. Accordingly, the trusts are not consolidated in our financial statements. The subordinated Debentures issued by us to the trusts are included in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition aslong-term debt with the corresponding interest distributions recorded as interest expense. The common shares issued by the trusts are included in other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition with the relateddividend distributions recorded in other non-interest income.

Thetrust preferred securities will be redeemed upon maturity of the related Debentures.            (2)      Reflects the coupon rate in effect at December 31, 2011. The coupon rate for the Bloomfield Hills Statutory Trust I is a variable rate and isbased on three-month LIBOR plus 2.65%. The coupon rates for the PrivateBancorp Statutory Trusts II and III are at a variable rate based on three-month LIBOR plus 1.71% for Trust II and three-month LIBOR plus 1.50% for Trust III. The coupon rate forthe PrivateBancorp Statutory Trust IV is fixed. Distributions for all of the Trusts are payable quarterly. We have the right to defer payment of interest on the Debentures at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding five yearsprovided no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity of the Debentures. During such extension period, distributions on the trust preferred securities would also be deferred, and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock would berestricted. The Federal Reserve has the ability to prevent interest payments on the Debentures.            (3)      The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the Debentures at maturity or their earlierredemption. Subject to restrictions relating to our participation in the TARP CPP, the Debentures are redeemable in whole or in part prior to maturity at any time after the dates shown in the table, and earlier at our discretion if certainconditions are met, and, in any event, only after we have obtained Federal Reserve approval, if then required under applicable guidelines or regulations.       114      13.  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY    TARPCapital Purchase Program    In January 2009, we issued 243,815 shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferredstock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock) to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 for proceeds of $243.8 million. Cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are payable at5% per annum for the first five years and at a rate of 9% per annum thereafter. We are prohibited from paying any dividend with respect to shares of our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid in full on the Series BPreferred Stock for all past dividend periods. The Series B Preferred Stock is non-voting, other than class voting rights on matters that could adversely affect the Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is callable at par afterthree years. Prior to the end of three years, the Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed with the proceeds from one or more qualified equity offerings of any Tier 1 perpetual preferred or common stock of at least $61.0 million (each aQualified Equity Offering). The redemption price is equal to the sum of the liquidation amount per share and any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series B preferred Stock. The U.S. Treasury may also transfer the Series B PreferredStock to a third party at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) requires the U.S. Treasury, subject to consultation with appropriate banking regulators, to permitparticipants in the CPP to redeem preferred stock issued under the CPP without regard to whether the recipient has completed a Qualified Equity Offering or replaced such funds from any other source, or to any waiting period.   In conjunction with the purchase of the Companys Series B Preferred Stock, the U.S. Treasury received a ten year warrant thatentitles it to purchase up to 1,290,026 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $28.35 per share. In December 2009, as a result of the completion of two qualified equity offerings, as provided by the terms of the warrant,the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant was reduced by 50% from 1,290,026 to 645,013 shares. The ARRA provides that the U.S. Treasury may liquidate this warrant if we fully redeem the Series B Preferred Stockeither as a result of redemption by us at a market price determined under the warrant or sale by the U.S. Treasury to a third party.    The Series B Preferred Stock and the warrant issued under the CPP are accounted for as permanent equity on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The allocated carrying values of the Series BPreferred Stock and the warrant on the date of issuance (based on their relative fair values) were $236.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively. The Series B Preferred Stock and the warrant qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital.   Under the terms of our agreements with the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the CPP, we are not prohibited fromincreasing quarterly common stock dividends at any time, but are precluded from raising the quarterly dividend above $0.075 per share prior to January 30, 2012. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is alsosubject to regulatory restrictions resulting from the recent losses we have incurred. We must provide notice to and obtain approval from the FRB before declaring or paying any dividends. Dividends also may be limited as a result of safety andsoundness considerations. Our quarterly common stock dividend for each of the four quarters of 2011 was $0.01 per share.    Issuance ofCommon Stock    There were no public or private offerings of common stock during 2011 or 2010 other than that issued inconnection with our share-based compensation plans. Refer to Note 16 for a detailed discussion of such plans.       115    The following table presents a summary of the Companys common stock offerings during2009.

The non-voting common stock converts into common stock ona one-for-one basis.            (2)      Includes 4.1 million shares, ($35.3 million) purchased by GTCR.           (3)      Equals the public offering price less the underwriting discount per share.   The net proceeds from the May and November 2009 public offerings, as well as from the sale of non-voting common stock, qualify astangible common equity and Tier 1 capital.    Issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and Conversion Transactions   In June 2009, we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (1) create a new class of non-voting common stock(the Non-voting Common Stock), and (2) amend and restate the Certificate of Designations of the Companys Series A Junior Non-voting Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) to provide, among other things,that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible only into shares of Non-voting Common Stock. Under the amended terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock was convertible into one share of Non-votingCommon Stock, each share of which is, in turn, convertible into one share of common stock. We issued 1,951,037 shares of Non-voting Common Stock to GTCR upon notice of conversion by GTCR of all of its 1,951.037 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.The shares of Series A Preferred Stock held and converted by GTCR represented all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock on such date. We also entered into an amendment to our existing Preemptive and Registration RightsAgreement with GTCR pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the newly issued shares of Non-voting Common Stock for resale under the Securities Act of 1933.       116    Comprehensive Income    Components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income    (Amounts in thousands)                                     Years Ended December 31,                     2011         2010         2009             Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Available-for- Sale Securities         Accumulated Gain (Loss) on Effective Cash Flow Hedges         Total         Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Available-for- Sale Securities         Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Available-for- Sale Securities        Balance at beginning of year       $  20,078            $  -            $  20,078            $  27,896            $  27,568          Unrealized gains on securities         47,431              -              47,431              359              8,439          Unrealized gains on cash flow hedges         -              3,156              3,156              -              -          Tax expense on unrealized gains         (18,869)             (1,256)             (20,125)             (108)             (3,246)         Reclassification adjustment of net gains included in net income         (5,812)             (570)             (6,382)             (13,095)             (7,896)         Reclassification adjustments for tax expense on realized net gains         2,312              227              2,539              5,026              3,031                                                                                                 Balance at end of year       $  45,140            $  1,557            $          46,697            $  20,078            $  27,896                                                                                                   117    14.

Deferred Tax Assets   During the first three quarterly periods of 2011, we were in a cumulative pre-tax loss position for financial statement purposes,measured on a trailing three-year basis. Under current accounting guidance, this represents significant negative evidence in the assessment of whether deferred tax assets will be realized. At December 31, 2011, we were no longer in a cumulativebook loss position. We have concluded that based on the weight provided by certain positive evidence (discussed below), it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.   Taxable income in prior years and reversing deferred taxable income amounts provide sources from which deferred tax assets may beabsorbed. Most significantly, however, we have relied on our ability to generate future federal taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences, as the primary source from which deferred tax assets will be absorbed.   In making the determination at December 31, 2011 that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized, weconsidered the positive evidence associated with (a) taxable income generated in 2010 and 2011; (b) reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods; (c) our emergence from a cumulative book loss position in 2011;(d) continued improvement in pre-tax, pre-loan loss provision earnings results during 2009-2011, a core source for future taxable income; (e) our reporting of pre-tax profits during most of 2010 and 2011; (f) the concentration ofcredit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio during the past three years and the relative moderation of credit trends in recent quarters; (g) our excess capital position relative to well capitalizedregulatory standards and other industry benchmarks; and (h) no history of federal net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of the 20-year federal net operating loss carryforward period.   We considered negative evidence associated with the continuing challenging economic conditions as well as both positive and negativeevidence associated with: (a) our accuracy in forecasting operating income and credit costs; and (b) the estimated timing of       120    reversals of deferred deductible and deferred taxable items and the level of such net reversal amounts relative to earnings assumptions in future periods.   Certain of the factors noted above support our expectation of generating pre-tax book earnings in future periods. We believe this in turnshould give rise to taxable income levels (exclusive of reversing temporary differences) that more likely than not would be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets.    Liabilities Associated with Unrecognized Tax Benefits    A reconciliation of thebeginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:    Roll Forward of Unrecognized Tax Benefits   (Amounts in thousands)                              Years Ended December 31,             2011         2010         2009        Balance at beginning of year       $  783            $  876            $  -          Additions for tax positions related to current year         -              86              -          Additions for tax positions related to prior years         12              848              876          Reductions for tax positions related to prior years         (42)             -              -          Reductions for lapse of statute of limitations         (254)             (250)             -          Reductions for settlements with tax authorities         -              (777)             -                                                               Balance at end of year       $          499            $          783            $          876                                                                    Interest and penalties, net of tax effect, recognized in income tax (benefit) expense during the year       $  (25)           $  23            $  68          Interest and penalties, net of tax effect, accrued at year end  (1)       $  57            $  82            $  68                 (1)    Not included inthe unrecognized tax benefits roll forward presented above    As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, therewere $454,000 and $631,000, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions that would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized in future periods. While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized taxbenefits will change in the next twelve months, the Company does not anticipate this change will have a material impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.   We file a U.S. federal income tax return and state income tax returns in various states. We are no longer subject to examinations by U.S.federal tax authorities for 2007 and prior years. We are also no longer subject to examinations by certain state departments of revenue for 2005 and prior years.    Illinois Tax Legislation    In January 2011, the state of Illinoispassed legislation that increased the corporate income tax rate from 7.3% to 9.5% (which includes a personal property replacement tax of 2.5%). The change is effective for tax years 2011 through 2014 with the rate declining to 7.75% in 2015 andreturning to the pre-2011 rate of 7.3% in 2025. As a result of this change, income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was reduced by $2.8 million for a one-time adjustment to the valuation of the Companys deferred tax asset,offset in part by higher Illinois tax expense on 2011 earnings.    16. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER BENEFITS   Share-Based Plans   2011 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2011 Plan)   In March 2011 the Board of Directors approved the 2011Plan which was subsequently approved in May 2011 by the Companys stockholders at the Companys 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The 2011 Plan replaced the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan) andallows for the issuance of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, equity-based performance stock and units, stock awards and other cash and stock-based incentives toemployees, including officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.       121    At December 31, 2011, the 2011 Plan remains the Companys only share-basedcompensation plan which allows for the granting of additional awards. At December 31, 2011, 4.7 million shares are available for future grant of which no more than 2.7 million remain available for issuance as restricted stock orunits. The number of shares that remain available for future grants also includes an indeterminate number of shares that may become available for re-issuance due to the recycling provisions under the 2011 Plan. To the extent shares of common stocksubject to an outstanding award under the 2011 Plan or the 2007 Plan are not issued or are cancelled by reason of the failure to earn the shares issuable under, or the forfeiture, termination, surrender, cancellation or expiration of such award,then such shares shall, to the extent of the forfeiture, cancellation or expiration, again be available for grant under the 2011 Plan. Shares of common stock shall not again be available for issuance if those shares are surrendered or withheld aspayment of either the exercise price of an award or used for the payment of withholding taxes in respect of an award.    TheCompany has four inactive plans for which no shares remain available for grant, but have unvested or unexercised awards outstanding at December 31, 2011.    Stock options that are issued to certain key employees vest generally over a period ranging from 3 to 5 years based on continuous service and have a 10-year term. All stock options granted under the planshave an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date the awards are granted. Although both incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options have been issued in the past, we have not issued incentive stock optionssince 2005.    We may also issue common stock with restrictions to certain key employees and non-employee directors. The sharesare restricted as to transfer, but are not restricted as to voting rights and generally receive similar dividend payments as stockholders, although in certain cases dividends are not distributed until vesting. Other than in the case of salary stockdiscussed below, the transfer restrictions generally lapse over a three-year period and are contingent upon continued employment and in certain cases on the satisfaction of specified performance criteria. We also issue restricted stock units whichsettle in common stock when restrictions lapse. These units are issued on similar terms as restricted common stock but these instruments have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents rather than dividends.   Effective in 2010, the Company began paying a portion of the base salary of certain executives in shares of the Companys commonstock (salary stock) under the 2007 Plan and effective in June 2011, the 2011 Plan. The salary stock is fully vested as of the grant date and has all of the rights of a stockholder, including the right to vote and receive dividends. As acondition of receiving the salary stock, each executive has entered into an agreement with the Company providing that he/she may not sell or otherwise transfer the shares of salary stock for 24 months after issuance, except in the event of death ordisability. The salary stock is paid in installments, semi-monthly on each payroll date with the number of shares issued based on the closing price of the Companys common stock as of each payroll date. The related expense is included insalaries and employee benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

At December 31, 2011, we believe there are adequate authorized shares to satisfy anticipated award issuances in 2012.       122    Financial Statement Impact   The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the option or award at the date of grant ormodification.

Stock Option Valuation Assumptions  - In accordance with current accounting guidance, we estimate the fair value of stockoptions at the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model that utilizes the assumptions outlined in the following table.    Stock Option Valuation Assumptions                              Years Ended December 31,                         2011                                 2010                                 2009                    Expected life of the option (in years)         4.5  5.5                 5.5  6.5                 5.0 - 6.6             Expected stock volatility         45.5  52.3%                 47.5 - 49.3%                 46.1 - 52.4%             Risk-free interest rate         1.9  3.7%                 2.5  4.2%                 2.8 - 4.0%             Expected dividend yield         0.3  0.6%                 0.3  0.4%                 0.1 - 2.1%             Weighted-average fair value of options at their grant date       $  6.80               $  6.29               $  7.58            Expected life is based on historical exercise and termination behavior. Expected stock price volatilityis based on historical volatility of our common stock combined with the implied volatility on the exchange traded stock options that are derived from the value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield currentlyavailable on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. The expected dividend yield represents the most recent annual dividend yield as of the date of grant. Management reviews and adjusts theassumptions used to calculate the fair value of an option on a periodic basis to better reflect expected trends.

Excluding the stock awards granted as salary stock as part ofcertain NEOs fixed compensation, 10%, 0% and 30% of the total restricted stock and unit awards were granted to the NEOs in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.           (3)    Does notinclude 937,182 awards modified in January 2010 of which 206,250 awards were granted to such NEOs. Refer to Share-Based Compensation Award Modifications in this footnote for further details.   The fair value of restricted stock and units that vest based on service provided by the recipient is determined based on our closingstock price on the date of grant and is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period.    Other Restricted Stockand Unit Award Information    (Dollars in thousands)                             Years Ended December 31,             2011         2010         2009        Total fair value of vested/released restricted stock and units       $          5,536             $          6,757             $          3,710           Income tax benefit realized from vesting/release of restricted stock and unit awards       $          1,700             $          2,067             $          1,421          Upon the vesting/release of restricted stock and unit awards, the Company records an adjustment to itsdeferred tax benefit previously recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income to reflect the actual tax benefit realized. The actual tax benefit realized is based on the fair value of the awards on the vesting/release date and the deferred taxbenefit is based on the fair value of the awards on the grant or modification date. The actual tax benefit realized for shares vesting or settling during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was less than the deferred tax benefitfor those shares, with the shortfall charged against prior years accumulated excess tax benefits maintained as a component of additional paid in capital in stockholders equity. The exercise or expiration of stockoptions can also give rise to shortfall tax benefits. The total of such shortfall charges to stockholders equity for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $2.6 million, $3.6 million, and $1.1 million,respectively. In addition, during 2011, $645,000 of the shortfall adjustment was included in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income as the balance in stockholders equity of the prior years accumulatedexcess tax benefits was reduced to $0. The shortfall adjustments recorded over the past three years were primarily due to the decline in our stock price at the vest/release date compared to the stock price when the awardswere granted.       126    Liability Awards    During 2011 we settled the share-based awards associated with the issuance of certain contractual put rights related to the minority interest owned by the principals of Lodestar. These awardswere settled in cash and accordingly were accounted as liability awards under current accounting guidance. Unlike equity awards, liability awards are re-measured at fair value at each reporting date until settlement, with the change in valuerecognized in current period expense. The charge to expense was $197,000 and $399,000 for 2011 and 2010, respectively, and a contra expense of $100,000 in 2009. The awards were settled for $3.6 million. The Company has no other liability awardsoutstanding at December 31, 2011.    Share-Based Compensation Award Modifications   On December 29, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved changes to the vesting schedules of certainequity awards previously granted to two executives of the Company to ensure that the vesting of such awards would comply with restrictions on incentive compensation applicable to certain of the most highly compensated employees of companies thatreceived funding under the U.S. Treasurys TARP CPP. Among other requirements, the TARP rules generally prohibit the Company from paying or accruing incentive bonuses (except for TARP-compliant restricted stock) to its five most highlycompensated employees as calculated for purposes of the TARP rules (MHCEs). While neither of these two executives were considered an MCHE when the equity awards were granted in early 2011, the reported changes are being made becauseit was anticipated they will be among the MHCEs for 2012.    The amended awards include 28,506 shares of restricted stock andnonqualified stock options to purchase, at $14.99 per share, 47,650 shares of the Companys common stock which were awarded to the two executives as part of the Companys 2010 annual incentive bonus program and the 2011 long-term incentiveprogram. Both the options and restricted shares were scheduled to vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of their respective grant dates.    The amendments provide for (1) acceleration of the vesting dates of the options so that they vested 100% on December 29, 2011 and (2) restructuring of the restricted stock to beTARP-compliant by pushing back the first vesting tranche of the restricted shares so that they will vest two-thirds on the second anniversary of their respective 2011 grant dates and one-third on the third anniversary. As a result of the acceleratedoption vesting dates, the recognition of the expense associated with the full fair value of the options, $329,000, was accelerated into 2011, but such action did not create any additional overall expense for the Company. The modification to thevesting dates for the restricted stock awards did not modify the fair value nor expense recognition of the fair value on such awards.    In 2010 the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors approved amendments to certain previously-granted performance share awards to modify the vesting provisions to provide for time vesting of theawards rather than performance vesting based on certain stock price appreciation targets established in 2007. The performance shares were awarded in late-2007 and 2008 pursuant to our Strategic Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and the 2007 Planin connection with the recruitment or retention of key employees. Except for the change in vesting conditions, the amendments did not change the number of shares, the vesting schedule, continued service requirements or any other terms or conditionsset forth in the original awards.    A total of 127 employees awards were modified. The incremental cost of thismodification was $9.9 million that would be recognized from 2010 through 2012. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, we recognized $2.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively, net of forfeitures in share-basedcompensation expense in connection with the modification of these awards.    There were no share-based compensation award modifications in 2009.   Savings and Retirement Plan    The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan, The PrivateBancorp, Inc. Savings, Retirement and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the KSOP), which allows employees, at their option, tomake contributions up to 75% of compensation on a pre-tax basis and/or after-tax basis through salary deferrals under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. At the employees direction, employee contributions are invested among avariety of investment alternatives. For employees who have met a one-year service requirement and make voluntary contributions to the KSOP, we contribute an amount equal to $0.50 for each dollar contributed up to 6% of an employeescompensation (subject to certain maximum compensation amounts as prescribed in Internal Revenue Service guidance). The Companys matching contribution vests in increments of 20% annually for each year in which 1,000 hours are worked. The KSOPalso allows for a discretionary company contribution. Although no such contribution was made for 2011, 2010 or 2009, the discretionary component vests in increments of 20% annually over a period of 5 years based on the employees years ofservice.       127    KSOP Plan Information   (Amounts in thousands)                              Years Ended December 31,             2011         2010         2009        Company matching contribution        $  1,931            $  1,785            $  1,463         Number of Company shares held in KSOP         479             465             428         Fair value of Company shares held by KSOP        $      5,261            $      6,681            $      3,839         Dividends received        $  20            $  18            $  14        Deferred Compensation Plan    We maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (the Plan) which allows eligible participants to defer the receipt of cash compensation or non-employee director fees otherwise payableto them. The purpose of the Plan is to further our ability to attract and retain high quality executives and non-employee directors. Executive officers who participate in the Plan may elect to defer up to 50% of annual base salary and 100% of annualbonus amounts and directors may elect to defer up to 100% of his or her annual directors fees. Participants elect at the time amounts are deferred whether such deferral amounts will be credited with earnings as if they wereinvested in either a fixed income account with interest credited based on our prime rate (not to exceed 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate) on the cash value of the funds deposited, or in deferred stock units (DSUs) in Companystock with earnings credited in the form of dividends equivalent to that paid to our common stockholders. Except for an earnings credit on the deferred amounts, we do not provide any contributions or credits to participants under thePlan. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were 128,026 and 72,947 DSUs, respectively, in the Plan. At the time of distribution, amounts credited in DSUs are paid in shares of our common stock while amounts credited in the fixed income accountare paid in cash. All elections and payments under the Plan are subject to compliance with requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code which may limit elections and require delay in payment of benefits in certain circumstances.   17. REGULATORY AND CAPITAL MATTERS    The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory requirements that impose restrictions on cash, loans or advances, and dividends. The Bank is required to maintain reserves against deposits.Reserves are held either in the form of vault cash or non-interest-bearing balances maintained with the FRB and are based on the average daily balances and statutory reserve ratios prescribed by the type of deposit account.   Cash Restrictions    (Amounts in thousands)                          December 31,             2011         2010        Reserve balances required to be maintained with the FRB        $      50,682            $      33,027         Cash and due from banks held as collateral for standby letter of credit services        $  -            $  22,000        Under current FRB regulations, the Bank is limited in the amount it may loan or advance to the parentcompany and its nonbank subsidiaries. Loans or advances to a single subsidiary may not exceed 10% and loans to all subsidiaries may not exceed 20% of the Banks capital stock and surplus, as defined. Loans from the Bank to nonbank subsidiariesand the parent company are also required to meet certain collateral requirements.    Various state banking regulations limit theamount of dividends that may be paid to the parent company by the Bank. Dividend payments by the Bank are subject to regulatory approval and are contingent upon a number of factors including the Banks ability to meet applicable regulatorycapital requirements, the strength of the Banks balance sheet and its ability to support any projected growth, and the Banks profitability and earnings. No dividends were paid by the Bank to the parent company during 2011 or 2010. As ofDecember 31, 2011, the Bank had the capacity under banking regulation to pay dividends of $50.3 million, subject to prior regulatory approval and the Companys internal capital policy.   Under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank are subject to various capital requirements adopted andadministered by the federal banking agencies. These guidelines specify minimum capital ratios calculated in accordance with the definitions in the guidelines, including the leverage ratio which is Tier 1 capital as a percentage of adjusted averageassets,       128    and the Tier 1 capital ratio and the total capital ratio each as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories. Theseminimum ratios are shown in the table below.    To satisfy safety and soundness standards, banking institutions are expected tomaintain capital levels in excess of the regulatory minimums depending on the risk inherent in the balance sheet, regulatory expectations and the changing risk profile of business activities and plans. Under our capital planning policy, we targetcapital ratios at levels we believe are appropriate based on such risk considerations, taking into account the current operating and economic environment, internal risk guidelines, and our strategic objectives as well as regulatory expectations. Atthe Bank, primarily due to our credit loss experience and recent levels of nonperforming loans, our policy currently calls for minimum capital ratios of 8.25% Tier 1 leverage and 12.0% total risk-based capital amongst other key capital metrics.   As of December 31, 2011, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. As ofDecember 31, 2011, the most recent regulatory notification classified the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification thatmanagement believes would change the Banks classification for this purpose. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory, and possible discretionary, actions by regulators which, if undertaken, could have amaterial effect on our consolidated financial statements.    The following table presents information about our capital measures and the relatedregulatory capital guidelines.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS    We utilize an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce certain risks related to interest rate risk, as it relates to mortgage loan commitments andplanned sales, and foreign currency volatility. We also use these instruments to accommodate our clients as we provide them with risk management solutions. None of the above-mentioned end-user and client-related derivatives were designated ashedging instruments at December 31, 2011 and 2010.       129    Additionally, in July 2011, we initiated the use of interest rate derivatives as part of ourasset strategy to hedge interest rate risk in our loan portfolio which is comprised primarily of floating rate loans. These derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges.    Derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk. Credit risk is managed through our standard underwriting process. Actual exposures are monitored against various types of credit limits established tocontain risk within parameters. Additionally, credit risk is managed through the use of collateral and netting agreements.

Authoritative accounting guidance permits the netting of derivative receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Company and a derivative counterparty. A master netting agreement is anagreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of any onecontract.            (4)      Capital markets group asset and liability derivatives are reported separately on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.      130    Certain of our derivative contracts contain embedded credit risk contingent features that iftriggered either allow the derivative counterparty to terminate the derivative or require additional collateral. These contingent features are triggered if we do not meet specified financial performance indicators such as minimum capital ratiosunder the federal banking agencies guidelines. All requirements were met at December 31, 2011. Details on these derivative contracts are set forth in the following table.

Cash flow hedges   During the third and fourth quarters of 2011, we entered into receive fixed/payvariable interest rate swaps to convert certain floating-rate commercial loans to fixed rate in order to substantially reduce the variability in forecasted interest cash flows due to market interest rate changes. We use regression analysis to assessthe effectiveness of cash flow hedges at the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness is generally measured as the amount by which the cumulative change in fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds the presentvalue of the cumulative change in the hedged items expected cash flows. Measured ineffectiveness is recognized directly in other non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The effective portion of the gains or losses on cashflow hedges are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and are subsequently reclassified to interest income on loans in the period that the hedged interest receipts affect earnings. As of December 31,2011, the maximum length of time over which forecasted interest cash flows are hedged is seven years. There are no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to our cash flow hedge strategy.

This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent toDecember 31, 2011.       131    Gain (Loss) Recorded in Consolidated Statements of Income   and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Related to    Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedge    (Amounts in thousands)                     Year Ended     December 31,     2011        Amount of gain (loss), net of tax, recognized in AOCI (effective portion)       $          1,900           Amount of gain (loss), pre-tax, reclassified from AOCI to interest income on loans         570           Amount of gain (loss), pre-tax, recognized in other non-interest income (ineffective portion)         -          During the year ended December 31, 2011, there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedgederivatives related to ineffectiveness that were reclassified to current earnings. We are required to reclassify such gains or losses related to ineffectiveness in circumstances where the original forecasted transaction is no longer probable ofoccurring.    Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships   End-User Derivatives   We enter into derivatives that include commitments to fund certainmortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans. It is our practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans whencustomer interest rate lock commitments are entered into to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates on our commitments to fund the loans as well as on our portfolio of mortgage loans held-for-sale. At December 31, 2011, wehad approximately $98.3 million of interest rate lock commitments and $130.3 million of forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans with rate locks at rates consistent with the lock commitment.    We are also exposed at times to foreign exchange risk as a result of issuing loans in which the principal and interest are settled in acurrency other than U.S. dollars. Currently our exposure is to the Euro and British pound on $12.1 million of loans and we manage this risk by using currency forward derivatives.   Client Related Derivatives   We offer, through our capital markets group, over-the-counter interest rate and foreign exchangederivatives to our clients, including but not limited to, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, interest rate options (also referred to as caps, floors, collars, etc.), foreign exchange forwards, and options as well as cash productssuch as foreign exchange spot transactions. When our clients enter into an interest rate or foreign exchange derivative transaction with us, we mitigate our exposure to market risk through the execution of off-setting positions with inter-bankdealer counterparties. Although the off-setting nature of transactions originated by our capital markets group limit our market risk exposure, they do expose us to other risks including counterparty credit, settlement, and operational risk.   To accommodate our loan clients, we occasionally enter into risk participation agreements (RPA) with counterpartybanks to either accept or transfer a portion of the credit risk related to their interest rate derivatives. This allows clients to execute an interest rate derivative with one bank while allowing for distribution of the credit risk amongparticipating members. We have entered into written RPAs in which we accept a portion of the credit risk associated with a loan clients interest rate derivative in exchange for a fee. We manage this credit risk through our loan underwritingprocess, and when appropriate, the RPA is backed by collateral provided by our clients under their loan agreement.    Thecurrent payment/performance risk of written RPAs is assessed using internal risk ratings which range from 1 to 8 with the latter representing the highest credit risk. The risk rating is based on several factors including the financial condition ofthe RPAs underlying derivative counterparty, present economic conditions, performance trends, leverage, and liquidity.   The maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments that we could be required to make under our written RPAs assumes that theunderlying derivative counterparty defaults and that the floating interest rate index of the underlying derivative remains at zero percent. In the event that we would have to pay out any amounts under our RPAs, we will seek to recover these fromassets that our clients pledged as collateral for the derivative and the related loan.       132    Risk Participation Agreements   (Dollars in thousands)                          December 31,             2011         2010        Fair value of written RPAs       $  (32)            $  (9)          Range of remaining terms to maturity (in years)         Less than 1 to 4               Less than 1 to 4           Range of assigned internal risk ratings         3 to 4               3 to 5           Maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments       $  3,075             $  2,413           Percent of maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments covered by proceeds from liquidation of pledgedcollateral         55%               80%          Gain (Loss) Recognized on Derivative Instruments   Not Designated in Hedging Relationship    (Amounts in thousands)                              Years Ended December 31,             2011         2010         2009        Gain on derivatives recognized in capital markets products income:                   Interest rate contracts       $      13,232            $  9,794            $  14,650          Foreign exchange contracts         5,719              4,301              2,433          Credit contracts         390              191              67                                                               Total capital markets group derivatives         19,341              14,286              17,150                                                               Gain (loss) on other derivatives recognized in other income, service charges and fees:                   Foreign exchange derivatives         141              32              (279)         Mortgage banking derivatives         (57)             (171)             230                                                               Total other derivatives         84              (139)             (49)                                                              Total derivatives       $  19,425            $      14,147            $      17,101                                                                 133    19. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES   Credit Extension Commitments and Guarantees    In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our clients and to conduct lending activities. Theseinstruments principally include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount reflected inthe Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and variable interest rates tied to the prime rate or LIBOR and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments areexpected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash-flow requirements. As of December 31, 2011, we had a reserve for unfunded commitments of $7.3 million, which reflects ourestimate of inherent losses associated with these commitment obligations. The reserve is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.    Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. Standby letters of credit include performance and financialguarantees for clients in connection with contracts between our clients and third parties. Standby letters of credit are agreements where we are obligated to make payment to a third party on behalf of a client in the event the client fails to meetits contractual obligations. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the client and the third party.   In the event of a clients nonperformance, our credit loss exposure is equal to the contractual amount of thosecommitments. We manage this credit risk in a similar manner to evaluating credit risk in extending loans to clients under our credit policies. We use the same credit policies in making credit commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments,mitigating exposure to credit loss through various collateral requirements, if deemed necessary. In the event of nonperformance by the clients, we have rights to the underlying collateral, which could include commercial real estate, physical plantand property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities.    The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by usunder standby letters of credit arrangements are equal to the contractual amount of the commitment. The unamortized fees associated with standby letters of credit, which are included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of FinancialCondition, totaled $633,000 as of December 31, 2011. We amortize these amounts into income over the commitment period. As of December 31, 2011, standby letters of credit had a remaining weighted-average term of approximately 13 months,with remaining actual lives ranging from less than 1 year to 19 years.       134    Credit Card Settlement Guarantees   Our third-party vendor issues corporate purchase credit cards on behalf of our commercial clients. The corporate purchase credit cardsare issued to employees of our commercial clients at the clients direction and used for payment of business-related expenses. In most circumstances, these cards will be underwritten by our third-party vendor. However, in certain circumstances,we may enter into a recourse agreement, which transfers the credit risk from the third-party vendor to us in the event that the licensee fails to meet its financial payment obligation. In these circumstances, a total exposure amount is establishedfor our corporate client. In addition to the obligations presented in the prior table, the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us under this third-party settlement guarantee is $3.2 million at December 31, 2011.   We believe that the estimated amounts of maximum potential future payments are not representative of our actual potential loss given ourinsignificant historical losses from this third-party settlement guarantee program. As of December 31, 2011, we have not recorded any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for this settlement guarantee program, andmanagement believes that the probability of any payments under this arrangement is remote.    Mortgage Loans Sold with Recourse   Certain mortgage loans sold have limited recourse provisions. We recorded no losses for the year endedDecember 31, 2011 arising from limited recourse provisions. The losses for the year ended December 31, 2010 arising from limited recourse provisions were not material. Based on this experience, the Company has not established any liabilityfor potential future payments relating to mortgage loans sold in prior periods.    Legal Proceedings   On October 22, 2010, a lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against the Company on behalf of apurported class of purchasers of our common stock between November 2, 2007 and October 23, 2009. Certain of our current and former executive officers and directors and firms that participated in the underwriting of our June 2008 and May2009 public offerings of common stock were also named as defendants in the litigation. On January 25, 2011, the City of New Orleans Employees Retirement System and State-Boston Retirement System were together named as the lead plaintiff,and an amended complaint was filed on February 18, 2011. The amended complaint alleged various claims of securities law violations against certain of the named defendants relating to disclosures we made during the class period in filings underthe Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs sought class certification, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, and rescission. The defendants filed ajoint motion to dismiss seeking dismissal of all counts. On November 7, 2011, the court released its decision on the defendants motion and dismissed all counts of the complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs did not appeal thecourts decision.    As of December 31, 2011, there were various legal proceedings pending against the Company and itssubsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financialcondition or cash flows.    20. ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   We measure, monitor, and disclose certain of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis toaccount for securities available-for-sale, mortgage loans held for sale, derivative assets, derivative liabilities, and certain other assets and other liabilities. In addition, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to applylower-of-cost-or-market accounting to foreclosed real estate and certain other loans held for sale, evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment, including collateral-dependent impaired loans, and for disclosure purposes. Fair value is defined asthe price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, we use various valuation techniquesand input assumptions when estimating fair value.    U.S. GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimizethe use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels based on the reliability of the input assumptions. The hierarchy gives thehighest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:                   Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.       135                Level 2  Observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments; quoted prices in markets that are notactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.                  Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets orliabilities.    The categorization of where an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy is based on thelowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.    Valuation Methodology   We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. However, the use of differentmethodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value. Additionally, the methods used may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of netrealizable value or reflective of future fair values.    The following describes the valuation methodologies we use for assetsand liabilities measured at fair value, including the general classification of the assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.    Securities Available-for-Sale   Securities available-for-sale include U.S. Treasury, collateralized mortgage obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities, state and municipalsecurities, and foreign sovereign debt. Substantially all available-for-sale securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but may be traded in active markets. The fair value of these securities is based on quotedmarket prices obtained from external pricing services. The principal markets for our securities portfolio are the secondary institutional markets, with an exit price that is predominantly reflective of bid level pricing in those markets. U.S.Treasury securities have been classified in level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Virtually all other remaining securities are classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. On a quarterly basis, the Company uses a variety of methods to validatethe overall reasonableness of the fair values obtained from external pricing services, including evaluating pricing service inputs and methodologies, using exception reports based on analytical criteria, comparing prices obtained to prices receivedfrom other pricing sources, and reviewing the reasonableness of prices based on the Companys knowledge of market liquidity and other market-related conditions. While our validation procedures may result in the use of a price obtained from ourprimary pricing source or our secondary pricing source, we have not altered the fair values obtained from the external pricing services.    Mortgage Loans Held for Sale   Mortgage loans held for sale represent mortgage loan originations intended to be sold in the secondary market. On August 1, 2011, we elected the fair valueoption for mortgage loans originated with the intention of selling to a third party bank that are originated as of or subsequent to this date. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for these loans with the related mortgagebanking derivatives used to economically hedge them. These mortgage loans are measured at fair value as of each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognized through mortgage banking non-interest income. Mortgage loans originated with theintention of selling to a third party bank prior to August 1, 2011 were accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is determined based on prices obtained for loans with similarcharacteristics from third party sources. On a quarterly basis, the Company validates the overall reasonableness of the fair values obtained from third party sources by comparing prices obtained to prices received from various other pricing sources,and reviewing the reasonableness of prices based on Company knowledge of market liquidity and other market-related conditions. Mortgage loans held for sale are classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.   Other Loans Held for Sale   Other loans held for sale represent other loans that management has an active plan to sell. Otherloans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value, which is determined based on a variety of factors, including quoted market rates and our judgment of other relevant market conditions. Other loans held for sale are classifiedin level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.    Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans   We do not record loans at fair valueon a recurring basis. However, periodically, we record nonrecurring adjustments to reduce the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurement. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest or principal will not be made inaccordance with the original contractual terms of the original loan agreement are considered impaired. Impaired loans for which repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral requires classification in the fairvalue hierarchy. We measure the fair value of collateral-dependent impaired loans based on the fair value of the collateral securing these loans. Substantially all collateral-dependent impaired loans are secured by real estate with the fair valuegenerally determined based upon appraisals performed by a certified or licensed appraiser using inputs such as absorption rates, capitalization rates and comparables. We also consider other factors or recent developments that could result inadjustments to the       136    collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals. Accordingly, fair value estimates for collateral-dependent impaired loans are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Thecarrying value of impaired loans and the related valuation allowance are disclosed in Note 4.    OREO   OREO isvalued on a nonrecurring basis using third-party appraisals of each property and our judgment of other relevant market conditions and is classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.   Covered Assets-Foreclosed Real Estate   Covered assets-foreclosed real estate is valued on a nonrecurring basis usingthird-party appraisals of each property and our judgment of other relevant market conditions and is classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.    Capital Market Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities   Client-related derivative instruments with positive fair values are reported as an asset and derivative instruments with negativefair value are reported as liabilities, in both cases after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. The fair value of client-related derivative assets and liabilities is determined based on prices obtained from third partyadvisors using standardized industry models. Many factors affect derivative values, including the level of interest rates, the markets perception of our nonperformance risk as reflected in our credit spread, and our assessment of counterpartynonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk assessment is based on our evaluation of credit risk, or if available, on observable external assessments of credit risk. Values of client-related derivative assets and liabilities are primarily based onobservable inputs and are generally classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 3 derivatives include risk participation agreements and derivatives associated with clients whose loans are risk rated 6 or higher. Refer to CreditQuality Indicators in Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements above for further discussion on risk ratings. On a quarterly basis, the Company uses a variety of methods to validate the overall reasonableness of thefair values obtained from third party advisors, including evaluating inputs and methodologies used by the third party advisors, comparing prices obtained to prices received from other pricing sources, and reviewing the reasonableness of prices basedon Company knowledge of market liquidity and other market-related conditions. While we may challenge prices obtained from third party advisors based on our validation procedures, we have not altered the fair values ultimately provided by the thirdparty advisors.    Other Assets and Other Liabilities   Included in other assets and other liabilities are cash flowhedges designated in a hedging relationship and other end-user derivative instruments that we use to manage our foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Those derivative instruments with a positive fair value are reported as assets and those with anegative fair value are reported as liabilities. The fair value is determined based on prices obtained from third party advisors. These derivative assets and liabilities are classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. On a quarterly basis, theCompany uses a variety of methods to validate the overall reasonableness of the fair values obtained from third party advisors, including evaluating inputs and methodologies used by the third party advisors, comparing prices obtained to pricesreceived from other pricing sources, and reviewing the reasonableness of prices based on Company knowledge of market liquidity and other market-related conditions. While we may challenge prices obtained from third party advisors based on ourvalidation procedures, we have not altered the fair values ultimately provided by the third party advisors.       137    Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis   The following table presents the hierarchy level and fair value for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair valueat December 31, 2011 and 2010 on a recurring basis.

If a change in valuation techniques or inputassumptions for an asset or liability occurred between periods, we would consider whether this would result in a transfer between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. There have been no significant transfers of assets or liabilities betweenlevel 1 and level 2 of the valuation hierarchy between December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011.    Other than electingthe fair value option for mortgage loans held for sale, there have been no other changes in the valuation techniques and related inputs we used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis from December 31, 2010 toDecember 31, 2011.       138    Reconciliation of Beginning and Ending Fair Value For Those   Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   (Amounts in thousands)                                     December 31, 2011        December 31, 2010                Derivative     Assets        Derivative     (Liabilities)                State and       Municipal   Securities Available- For-Sale          Derivative   Assets        Derivative   (Liabilities)          Balance at beginning of year     $  4,654          $  (9)         $  3,615            $  1,468           $  (101)         Total gains (losses):                                   Included in earnings  (1)        (163)            377             -              2,436             170          Included in other comprehensive income        -              -              -              -              -           Purchases, issuances, sales and settlements:                                   Purchases        -               -              -              -              -           Issuances        42             (30)            -              -              (78)         Sales        -              -              (3,615)            -              -           Settlements        (3,490)            (370)            -              (3,819)            -           Level 3 transfers (out) in        (216)            -              -              4,569             -                                                                                             Balance at end of year     $  827          $  (32)         $  -             $  4,654           $  (9)                                                                                           Change in unrealized gains (losses) in earnings relating to assets and liabilities still held at end of year     $  (304)         $  (377)         $  -             $  2,391           $  (165)                                                                                                  (1)      Amounts disclosed in this line are included in capital markets products income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.   During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, $845,000 and $8.9 million of derivative assets were transferredfrom level 2 to level 3 of the valuation hierarchy due to a lack of observable market data, as there was deterioration in the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. Also, during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively,$1.1 million and $4.3 million of derivative assets were transferred from level 3 to level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to an improvement in the credit risk of the counterparty. We recognize transfers in and transfers out at the end of eachquarterly reporting period.

Estimated Fair Valueof Certain Financial Instruments    U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair values of certain financialinstruments, both assets and liabilities, on and off-balance sheet, for which it is practical to estimate the fair value. Because the estimated fair values provided herein exclude disclosure of the fair value of certain other financial instrumentsand all non-financial instruments, any aggregation of the estimated fair value amounts presented would not represent total underlying value. Examples of non-financial instruments having significant value include the future earnings potential ofsignificant customer relationships and the value of Trust and Investments operations and other fee-generating businesses. In addition, other significant assets including property, plant, and equipment and goodwill are not considered financialinstruments and, therefore, have not been valued.    Various methodologies and assumptions have been utilized inmanagements determination of the estimated fair value of our financial instruments, which are detailed below. The fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in time based on relevant market information. Because no market exists for asignificant portion of these financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected economic conditions, loss experience, and risk characteristics of the financial instruments. These estimates are subjective,involve uncertainties, and cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.    In addition to the valuation methodology explained above for financial instruments recorded at fair value, the following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of financialinstruments that are carried at cost in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.    Short-term financial assetsand liabilities   For financial instruments with a shorter-term or with no stated maturity, prevailing market rates, and limited credit risk, the carrying amounts approximate fair value. Those financial instruments include cash and due frombanks, federal funds sold and other short-term investments, accrued interest receivable, and accrued interest payable.       140    Securities held-to-maturity   The fair value of securities held-to-maturity isbased on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.    Non-marketable equity investments   Non-marketable equity investments include FHLB stock and other various equity securities. The carrying value of FHLB stock approximates fair value as thestock is non-marketable, but can only be sold to the FHLB or another member institution at par. The carrying value of all other equity investments approximates fair value.    Loans   The fair value of loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest raterisk inherent in the loan. The estimate of maturity is based on contractual terms and includes assumptions that reflect our and the industrys historical experience with repayments for each loan classification. The estimation is modified, asrequired, by the effect of current economic and lending conditions, collateral, and other factors.    Covered assets  Covered assets include the acquired loans and foreclosed loan collateral (including the fair value of expected reimbursements from the FDIC). The fair value of covered assets is calculated by discounting expected cash flows through the estimatedmaturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the asset. The estimate of maturity is based on contractual terms and includes assumptions that reflect our and the industrys historicalexperience with repayments for each asset classification. The estimate is modified, as required, by the effect of current economic and lending conditions, collateral, and other factors.   Investment in BOLI   The fair value of our investment in BOLI is equal to its cash surrender value.   Deposit liabilities   The fair values disclosed for noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings deposits, interest-bearingdeposits, and money market deposits are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The fair value for certificates of deposit and brokered deposits were estimated using present value techniques bydiscounting the future cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.    Short-term borrowings   The fair value of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances with the remaining maturities of one year or less is estimated by discounting the obligations using the ratescurrently offered for repurchase agreements or borrowings of similar remaining maturities. The carrying amounts of funds purchased and other borrowed funds approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature.   Long-term debt   The fair value of subordinated debt, FHLB advances with remaining maturities greater than one year, and thejunior subordinated debentures are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments.    Commitments   Given the limited interest rate exposure posed by the commitments outstanding at period-end due to their variable rate structure, termination clauses provided in the agreements,and the market rate of fees charged, we have deemed the fair value of commitments outstanding to be immaterial.       141    Financial Instruments   (Amounts in thousands)                                 As of            December 31, 2011        December 31, 2010                  Carrying       Amount        Estimated       Fair Value                    Carrying       Amount        Estimated       Fair Value              Financial Assets:                             Cash and due from banks      $  156,131           $  156,131           $  112,772           $  112,772          Federal funds sold and other short-term investments        205,610             205,610             541,316             541,316          Loans held for sale        32,049             32,049             30,758             30,758          Securities available-for-sale        1,783,465             1,783,465             1,881,786             1,881,786          Securities held-to-maturity        490,143             493,230             -             -          Non-marketable equity investments        43,604             43,604             23,537             23,537          Loans, net of allowance for loan losses and unearned fees        8,816,967             8,465,358             8,891,536             8,535,266          Covered assets, net of allowance for covered loan losses        280,868             306,976             381,876             400,783          Accrued interest receivable        35,732             35,732             33,854             33,854          Investment in BOLI        50,966             50,966             49,408             49,408          Capital markets derivative assets        101,676             101,676             100,250             100,250          Financial Liabilities:                             Deposits      $  10,392,854           $  10,405,158           $  10,535,429           $  10,549,930          Short-term borrowings        156,000             156,047             118,561             120,522          Long-term debt        379,793             343,121             414,793             414,340          Accrued interest payable        5,567             5,567             5,968             5,968          Capital markets derivative liabilities        104,140             104,140             102,018             102,018              21.

The Banking operating segment includes commercial and personalbanking services, which includes mortgage originations. Commercial banking services are primarily provided to corporations and other business clients and include a wide array of lending and cash management products. Personal banking services offeredto individuals, professionals, and entrepreneurs include direct lending and depository services. The Trust and Investments segment includes certain activities of our PrivateWealth group, including investment management, investment advisory, personaltrust and estate administration, custodial and escrow, retirement account administration, and brokerage services. The activities of the third operating segment, the Holding Company, include the direct and indirect ownership of our banking andnonbanking subsidiaries, the issuance of debt and intersegment eliminations.    The accounting policies of the individualoperating segments are the same as those of the Company as described in Note 1. Transactions between operating segments are primarily conducted at fair value, resulting in profits that are eliminated from consolidated results of operations.Financial results for each segment are presented below. For segment reporting purposes, the statement of financial condition of Trust and Investments is included with the Banking segment.       142    Operating Segments Performance   (Amounts in thousands)

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES    As discussed in Note 12, we sponsor and wholly own 100% of the common equity of four trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities to third-party investors and investingthe proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities solely in debentures issued by the Company. The trusts only assets as of December 31, 2011 were the $244.8 million principal balance of the debentures and the related interestreceivable. The trusts meet the definition of a VIE, but the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts and accordingly, the trusts are not consolidated in our financial statements.   We hold certain investments in funds that make investments in accordance with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act. Suchinvestments have a carrying amount of $2.6 million at December 31, 2011 and are included within non-marketable equity investments in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The investments meet the definition of a VIE, but theCompany is not the primary beneficiary as we are a limited investor in those investment funds and do not have the power over their investment activities. Accordingly, we will continue to account for our interests in these investments using the costor equity method. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount plus additional required future capital contributions of $1.6 million as of December 31, 2011.        23.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON   ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE    Not applicable.    ITEM 9A. CONTROLS ANDPROCEDURES    As of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date), the Company carried outan evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of theCompanys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concludedthat as of the Evaluation Date, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.   Managements Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as definedin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation andfair presentation of published financial statements.    Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief FinancialOfficer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control  IntegratedFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 waseffective based on the specified criteria.    Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm thataudited the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,2011. That report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, is included in this Item under the heading Attestation Report of Independent RegisteredPublic Accounting Firm.    Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    The Board of Directors and Shareholders of PrivateBancorp, Inc.    We have auditedPrivateBancorp, Inc.s and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). PrivateBancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reportingbased on our audit.    We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining anunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such otherprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.       148    A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to providereasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) providereasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that couldhave a material effect on the financial statements.    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financialreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.    In our opinion, PrivateBancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in allmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.    We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial condition of PrivateBancorp, Inc. andsubsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 ofPrivateBancorp, Inc. and our report dated February 27, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.    /S/ ERNST &YOUNG LLP    Chicago, Illinois   February 27, 2012       149    ITEM 9B.
