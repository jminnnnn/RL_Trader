ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    INTRODUCTION    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The following discussion and analysis is intended to address the significant factors affecting our Consolidated Statements of Income for the years 2007 through 2009 and Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2008 and 2009. When we use the terms PrivateBancorp, the Company, we, us, and our, we mean PrivateBancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term the the Banks, we are referring to our wholly owned banking subsidiaries, The PrivateBank brand. The discussion is designed to provide stockholders with a comprehensive review of our operating results and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes thereto, and other financial information presented in this Form 10-K.    ALIGN="justify"> Unless otherwise stated, all earnings per share data included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"> OVERVIEW    Our operating results during 2009 continued to be negatively impacted by the effect of the weak economy on our borrowers, especially in the residential and commercial real estate sectors. This weakness has resulted in continued stress in our loan portfolio, and required us to recognize a provision for loan and covered asset losses of $199.4 million and to charge-off $101.3 million in loans during 2009.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Despite the difficult operating and credit environment we experienced strong growth in both loans and deposits as well as in our operating profit. Continued growth in client relationship resulted in increased fee revenue and additional opportunities to cross-sell our enhanced products and services, including in our capital markets and treasury management areas. We believe continued growth in client relationships should lead to higher net revenue and deposits and continued improvement in our net interest margin. Throughout        28           the year we strengthened our credit risk management process, focusing on enhanced asset quality management, and in the fourth quarter we redeployed a number of our bankers to leverage their specific industry expertise to deal with the challenges in our credit portfolio.    Key factors affecting our operating results for 2009 include the following:                   Net charge-offs totaled $89.9 million compared to $125.8 million in 2008.    STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">               The allowance for loan losses was $221.7 million at December 31, 2009, or 2.44% of total loans, compared with $112.7 million, or 1.40% of total loans, at December 31, 2008; the loan loss allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 56% at December 31, 2009 compared to 85% at December 31, 2008.    STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">               Nonperforming loans to total loans were 4.36% at December 31, 2009, compared to 1.64% at December 31, 2008.                  Other real estate owned totaled $41.5 million at year end 2009 compared to $23.8 million at the end of 2008, comprised of 259 properties.                  Net interest income was $325.0 million compared to $190.4 million for 2008, an increase of 71%.    STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">               Non-interest income increased 73%, to $71.5 million, compared to $41.3 million in 2008, primarily as a result of an increase in fee revenue from the expansion of our products and services offered through the treasury management and capital markets groups as well as a significant increase in mortgage banking income.    STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">               Our loan portfolio increased 13%, or $1.0 billion, resulting in a significant increase in interest income and growth to $12.1 billion in assets.                  Client deposits grew to $9.3 billion, an increase of 55%, reducing our reliance on more expensive wholesale funding sources; total brokered deposits decreased 41% from year end 2008.                   Fee income grew to $65.1 million as a result of the expansion of our treasury management, capital markets, and letter of credit services.                  Net revenue grew 70% over 2008 to $400.1 million; operating profit increased 287% to $152.7 million, up from $39.4 million in 2008.                  Net interest margin increased to 3.06% for 2009 compared to 2.73% in 2008 primarily due to growth in client deposits and a 165 basis point decrease in the cost of funds, which was only partially offset by a 126 basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets year-over-year.                   Our efficiency ratio improved to 61.8% for 2009, compared to 83.3% for 2008.    STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">               We raised a total of approximately $411 million, after deducting underwriting commissions but before offering expenses, in new equity capital during 2009, resulting in a ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets of 7.41% at December 31, 2009.    SIZE="2">In the third quarter of 2009, The PrivateBank - Chicago, acquired approximately $843 million in assets, including $181 million in investments and $592 million in loans, and assumed $791 million in liabilities including $767 million in non-brokered deposits and $24 million in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances of the former Founders Bank (Founders) from the FDIC in an FDIC-assisted transaction. The PrivateBank - Chicago and the FDIC entered into a loss sharing agreement regarding future losses incurred on loans and foreclosed loan collateral existing at closing. Under the terms of the loss-sharing agreements, the FDIC generally will assume 80% of the first $173 million of credit losses and 95% of the credit losses in excess of $173 million .  We believe the transaction provides us a strong platform upon which to build our new Community Banking line of business, including additional opportunities to cross-sell our products and services and generate new core funding.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income, provision for loan and covered asset losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on, interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on, interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of        29           interest as well as to the execution of our asset/liability management strategy. The provision for loan and covered asset losses is primarily affected by changes in the loan portfolio, managements assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio, loss experience, as well as economic and market factors. Non-interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from The PrivateWealth Group, capital market product income, treasury management fees, mortgage banking income, bank owned life insurance and fees for ancillary banking services. Net securities gains/losses and net gains/losses on interest rate swaps, if any, are also included in non-interest income.   Net Income    SIZE="2">Our net loss available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $42.5 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $93.5 million, or $3.16 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, and net income of $11.0 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher non-interest expenses and the preferred stock dividend paid at the holding company, continued high levels of provision for loan and covered asset losses of $199.4 million, offset by 71% growth in net interest income and fee revenue from new capital markets and treasury management product offerings and banking and other services income. During the year, we charged-off $101.3 million in non-performing loans.    SIZE="2"> Net Interest Income    Net interest income is the primary source of our revenue. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest-earning and other assets or activities. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities, repricing frequencies, and the use of interest rate swaps and caps.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. The net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, also support earning assets. To compare tax-exempt asset yields to taxable yields, the yield on tax-exempt investment securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis. Net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin are discussed on a taxable equivalent basis.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets are presented in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    Our accounting and reporting policies conform to U.S. GAAP and general practice within the financial services industry. For purposes of this discussion, net interest income and any ratios or metrics that include net interest income as a component, such as for example, net interest margin, have been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax-exempt securities to those on taxable interest-earning assets. Although we believe that these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of our business and performance, these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to U.S. GAAP. The reconciliation of such adjustment is presented in the following table.    STYLE="margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"> Table 1    SIZE="2"> Effect of Tax-Equivalent Adjustment    (Amounts in thousands)    STYLE="font-size:12px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">                              Years Ended December 31,      % Change             2009      2008      2007      2009-2008        2008-2007        Net interest income (U.S. GAAP)      $  324,984      $  190,395      $  127,038      70.7         49.9         Tax-equivalent adjustment         3,612         3,857         4,274      (6.4  )      (9.8  )                                                 Tax-equivalent net interest income      $  328,596      $  194,252      $  131,312      69.2         47.9                                                          Table 2 provides average balances of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the associated interest income and expense, and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid, as well as net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis for the three years ended December 31, 2009. The table also presents the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for 2009 and 2008, including the tax-equivalent yields on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.        30           Table 3 below details increases in income and expense for each of the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and analyzes the extent to which such variances are attributable to volume and rate changes. Interest income and yields are presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%, which includes the tax-equivalent adjustment as presented in Table 1 above.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"> 2009 Compared to 2008    Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $328.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $194.3 million for 2008, an increase of 69%. The volume of assets and liabilities and the corresponding rates earned and paid affect net interest income. The increase in net interest income for 2009 is primarily attributable to substantial growth in interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets for 2009 were $10.7 billion compared to $7.1 billion for 2008, an increase of 51%. Our net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis increased to 3.06% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2.73% for the prior year primarily due to a 165 basis point decrease in the cost of funds, which was only partially offset by a 126 basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets year-over-year. Our balance sheet is structured such that our interest bearing liabilities reprice more slowly than our interest earning assets as interest rates change. Throughout 2009, the Prime rate of interest did not fall as it did during 2008 and short term LIBOR rates fell less and more slowly than during 2008. Therefore, during 2009 we were able to reprice our interest bearing liabilities such that the level of reductions outpaced those on our interest earning assets. Additionally, during 2009 our continued growth of client deposits allowed us to reposition our funding mix away from more costly wholesale funding, further benefiting our net interest margin. Non-interest bearing funds impact net interest margin since they represent non-interest bearing sources of funds that are deployed to fund interest bearing assets. Non-interest bearing funds positively impacted net interest margin by 33 basis points for 2009 and 39 basis points for 2008. Net interest margin increased during 2009 initially due to rates falling on our interest bearing liabilities more quickly than the yields on our interest earning assets. During the second half of the year, net interest margin was further benefited by the inclusion of favorably priced interest-earning assets, acquired as a result of the Founders transaction.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">However, our net interest margin was negatively impacted by the increase in non-performing assets during the year, which grew to $436.9 million at December 31, 2009 from $155.7 million at December 31, 2008.    2008 Compared to 2007    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $194.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $131.3 million for 2007, an increase of 48%. The increase in net interest income for 2008 is primarily attributable to substantial growth in interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets for 2008 were $7.1 billion compared to $4.2 billion for 2007, an increase of 70%. Our net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis declined to 2.73% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 3.14% for the prior year primarily due to a 172 basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets year over year, which was only partially offset by a 137 basis point reduction in the cost of funds over the same period. Non-interest bearing funds positively impacted net interest margin by 39 basis points for 2008 and 45 basis points for 2007. Net interest margin declined throughout 2008 due to continued decreases in the prime and LIBOR rates of interest as our interest earning assets re-priced more quickly than our interest-bearing deposits.    SIZE="2">Our net interest margin was further negatively impacted by the increase in non-performing assets during the year, which grew to $155.7 million at December 31, 2008 from $48.3 million at December 31, 2007.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> We continue to use multiple interest rate scenarios to rigorously assess the direction and magnitude of changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest income.

(3) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    Covered assets represent assets acquired from the FDIC subject to a loss share agreement and are presented separately on the Consolidated Statements of Condition.    As shown in Tables 2 and 3, tax-equivalent net interest income in 2009 increased $134.3 million compared to 2008. This was the result of both an increase in interest income and a decrease in interest expense. The increase in interest earning assets increased tax-equivalent interest income by $184.7 million, while a decline in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets reduced interest income by $111.6 million. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities increased interest expense by $48.6 million, but the shift to lower costing money market accounts and the overall decrease in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased interest expense by $109.8 million.    Provision for Loan and Covered Asset Losses    The provision for loan and covered asset losses consists of two components; (1) provision for loan losses associated with our originated loan portfolio, and (2) provision for covered asset losses associated with assets acquired in the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Founders that are covered by a loss share agreement.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" ALIGN="justify"> Provision for loan losses    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The provision for loan losses is predominantly a function of our reserving methodology and judgments as to other qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses after net charge-offs have been deducted to        33           bring the allowance to a level which, in managements best estimate, is necessary to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in the existing loan portfolio. Our methodology focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans, historical losses and delinquencies on each portfolio category, the risk inherent in specific loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors which could affect potential credit losses    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The provision for loan losses totaled $198.9 million in 2009 compared to $189.6 million in 2008 and $16.9 million in 2007. The increase in 2009 was primarily due to loan growth of 13% during the year, and net-charge-offs of $89.9 million in 2009 compared to $125.8 million in 2008 and $6.1 million in 2007. Net charge-offs in 2009 were largely driven by the continued deterioration in commercial real estate market conditions in all of our key lending markets we operate in. For further analysis and information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses and the factors on which provisions are based, see the Credit Quality Management and Allowance for Loan Losses section.    Provision for covered asset losses    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> During fourth quarter 2009, a $2.8 million allowance for covered asset losses was established related to the loans purchased under the Founders loss share agreement and reflected a decline in expected cashflows since the date of acquisition of such loans. The provision for covered asset losses totaled $553,000 in 2009, representing the 20% non-reimbursable portion of the loss share agreement.    Non-interest Income    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Non-interest income is derived from a number of sources related to our banking, capital markets, treasury management and wealth management businesses.

( 2 STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> )     Banking and other services income for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes $4.2 million net loss on sale of loans.   2009 Compared to 2008    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During 2009 we continued to seek ways to increase and diversify the sources of our non-interest income. Our total non-interest income increased 73%, to $71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in non-interest income during 2009 was due to the contribution of our expanded products and services (which were expanded in the past year) offered through the treasury management group, new product offerings contributing to increased banking and other services income, increased revenue from capital markets products, and a significant increase in mortgage banking income.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">      34          Capital markets income was $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a 55% increase from $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The 2009 income includes an $838,000 favorable movement in the credit valuation adjustment (CVA). The CVA represents the credit component of fair value with regard to both client-based trades and the related matched trades with interbank dealer counterparties. Capital markets revenue is sensitive to the pace of loan growth, a steepened LIBOR curve and our clients interest rate expectations. Also, low short term interest rates have accelerated the yield protection trend of embedding floors in loans, resulting in fewer derivatives cross sell opportunities.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We continue to enhance our treasury management capabilities and now provide all aspects of receivables and payables services in addition to online banking and reporting. We offer remote capture, liquidity management, and lockbox services to meet our clients needs and drive non-interest and interest-bearing deposits to the Banks. Treasury management income was $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase is attributable to growth in delivery of services to new and existing clients and increased penetration in our clients transaction-based activities.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Mortgage banking income was $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Mortgage banking income increased over the prior period due to the low interest rate environment, which continues to stimulate market demand for refinancing and a higher volume of loans sold.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> The PrivateWealth Groups fee revenue was $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The PrivateWealth Groups assets under management (which includes investment management, trust and custodial accounts) were $4.0 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase from $3.3 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease in revenue year-over-year is due to lower asset values during the first half of 2009 and a higher allocation of assets to non-fee producing cash equivalents and an increase in lower-fee producing client relationships during 2009 compared to 2008.    Banking and other services income increased approximately 162% to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase from the prior year period is primarily due to fees related to increased product offerings such as syndication fees, unused commitment fees and an increase in letters of credit fees.    Non-interest income in 2009 includes net investment securities gains of $7.4 million compared to net gains of $510,000 in the prior year period. The increase in securities gains was primarily due to sales of U.S. Treasury securities made during the second quarter of 2009.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"> 2008 Compared to 2007    SIZE="2">Non-interest income increased 57%, to $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Of the $15.0 million increase in non-interest income during 2008, approximately 83% was due to the robust growth in fee income from our treasury management and capital markets groups. During 2008, we enhanced or introduced a variety of new products and services including capital markets products, lockbox, control disbursement, virtual vault, interest-rate swaps, and foreign exchange services. Capital markets income was $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Treasury management income was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase from $950,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007.    The PrivateWealth Group fee revenue was $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase from $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The year over year increase in The PrivateWealth Group fee revenue was due to earnings on higher asset values prior to the significant decline in the debt and equity markets during fourth quarter 2008 and continued implementation of higher fees structures for certain client relationships. The PrivateWealth Group assets under management were $3.3 billion at December 31, 2008, a slight decrease from $3.4 billion at December 31, 2007, with new business nearly offset by cash transfers to the Banks CDARS STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">®  program and lower market values due to declining debt and equity markets.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Banking and other services income increased approximately 71% to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase from the prior year period is primarily due to an increase in letters of credit fees.    Non-interest income in 2008 includes net investment securities gains of $510,000 compared to net gains of $348,000 in the prior year period. The increase in securities gains in 2008 was due to gains realized in selective repositioning of the investment portfolio.

See Table 1 for a reconciliation of the effect of the tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income.    2009 Compared to 2008   Our revenue growth continues to outpace growth in our expenses and we continue to actively run our business to maintain tight cost control and expense management while still making the necessary investments needed to operate our business. Our efficiency ratio (non-interest expense as a percentage of tax-equivalent net interest income plus total non-interest income) was 61.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 83.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008. This ratio indicates that during 2009 we spent $0.62 to generate each dollar of revenue, compared to $0.83 in 2008.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Non-interest expense increased $51.3 million, or 26%, to $247.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $196.1 million for the prior year period. The increase represents continued investment in our strategic development throughout the year and a combined increase in net occupancy expense, technology costs, loan and collection expenses, and significantly higher insurance costs. The increase over the prior year is also due to the ongoing and defined transaction integration costs attributable to the Founders transaction.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Compensation expense increased 6% to $123.7 million in 2009, compared to $116.7 million in 2008, due to the 35% increase in full-time equivalent (FTE) employees from 773 FTEs at year end 2008 to 1,040 FTEs at December 31, 2009. The increase in FTEs is primarily associated with the addition of 225 employees from the former Founders Bank. The 2009 increase was partially offset by a $13.4 million net reduction in our annual cash incentive plans (CIP) compared to full year 2008. Our principal CIP is primarily based on the Companys earning performance and due to its net loss in 2009, the plan did not provide for incentive compensation payment to employees other than to associate managing directors, certain officers and staff. CIP accruals for Management (those above an associate managing director title) recorded in the first half of 2009 were reversed in the third quarter, with no additional accruals recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009.         36          The 53% increase in occupancy expense during 2009 to $26.2 million, compared to $17.1 million in 2008, reflects the investments we have made in growing our office space to accommodate our larger downtown Chicago team and ten additional offices acquired as a result of the Founders transaction.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Technology and related costs, which include fees paid for information technology services and support, increased 68% to $10.6 million in 2009, compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Technology and related costs increased during 2009 due to increased operational costs and investment in technology to support our expanded products and services as a result of our growth and the Founders integration costs.    Professional fees, which include fees paid for legal, accounting, consulting, and information systems consulting services, increased 17% to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $14.0 million for 2008. The increase is primarily due to costs associated with the execution of the Founders transaction and subsequent integration activities.    Insurance expense increased by $15.2 million to $22.6 million at December 31, 2009 from $7.4 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in insurance expense is primarily due to an increase in FDIC insurance premiums caused by increased rates, special assessments totaling $5.1 million in the second quarter 2009, and a 24% increase in deposit balances during 2009. The magnitude of this expense is determined by deposit levels and the premiums imposed by the FDIC, which remain subject to change and are dependent in part on the banks safety and soundness rating by the FDIC.    Loan and collection expense increased 218% to $9.6 million at December 31, 2009 from $3.0 million at December 31, 2008. The $6.6 million increase is due to costs associated with nonperforming loan review, monitoring and workout activity.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Other expenses increased 114% to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $6.7 million for 2008. Other expense includes various categories such as bank charges, costs associated with the CDARS ®  product offering, education related costs, subscriptions, and miscellaneous losses and expenses. The $7.6 million increase is largely attributable to higher CDARS ®  fee expense correlated to the growth in this deposit category, increased fees paid to third party service providers used on a recurring basis, and restructuring charges.    2008 Compared to 2007    Non-interest expense increased $73.7 million, or 60%, to $196.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $122.4 million 2007 with increases in all major categories of non-interest expense representing significant investment during 2008 in our people and our infrastructure to implement and support our growth.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Due to the increase of 176 FTEs, or 30% from year end 2007 of 597 FTEs, compensation expense increased 64% to $116.7 million in 2008, compared to $71.2 million in 2007. The increase in FTEs is directly associated with the implementation of our strategic growth plan and our investment in attracting and retaining the highest quality human capital as a cornerstone of that plan. This resulted in greater base salary costs and attendant payroll taxes and medical program costs, sign-on and annual bonuses and, most significantly, share-based compensation expense, a majority of which were incurred in connection with the transformational equity awards issued in fourth quarter 2007 and throughout 2008.    The 29% increase in occupancy expense during 2008 to $17.1 million, compared to $13.2 million in 2007, is due to the expansion and improvement of several of our existing offices and leasing office space for new business development offices opened in 2008. During the second quarter 2008, we signed a definitive lease agreement for office space at 120 South LaSalle Street in Chicago and moved our headquarters there in the first quarter of 2009.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Technology and related costs increased 50% to $6.3 million in 2008, compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Technology and related costs increased during 2008 due to investment in technology company-wide and support for facility relocations and upgrading.    Marketing expense increased 71% to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in marketing expense reflects an increase in marketing initiatives for client development, website upgrade, charitable contributions, and overall growth in our business development activities.    Professional fees increased 18% to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, from $11.9 million for 2007. The increase is primarily due to higher legal and consulting fees to support various strategic initiatives including the rapid expansion of products and service offerings, infrastructure enhancements, hiring of key personnel and increased fees paid for external and internal audit services.         37          Net foreclosed property expense was $6.2 million at December 31, 2008, an increase of 179% from $2.2 million at December 31, 2007. Net foreclosed property expense includes expenses paid during 2008 relating to the resolution of OREO, including legal expenses and write-downs on OREO properties.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Insurance expense increased 282% to $7.4 million at December 31, 2008 from $1.9 million at December 31, 2007. The increase in insurance expense is primarily due to an increase in FDIC insurance premiums caused by increased rates and a substantial increase in deposit balances during 2008.    ALIGN="justify"> Other expenses and loan and collection expense increased 118% to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $4.5 million for 2007. Other expense includes various categories such as bank charges, costs associated with the CDARS ®  product offering, education related costs, subscriptions, credit related costs and miscellaneous losses and expenses. The $5.2 million increase is largely attributable to higher CDARS STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">®  fee expense correlated to the growth in this deposit category, greater credit related costs associated with increased nonperforming loan activity and increased subscriptions and education costs to service 176 additional FTEs.    Our efficiency ratio, which measures the percentage of net revenue that is expended as non-interest expense, for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased to 83.3%, as compared to 77.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our efficiency ratio during 2008 reflected the impact of the higher level of non-interest expenses associated with continued implementation of our plan throughout 2008, with revenue gains lagging in time as expected. On a tax-equivalent basis, this ratio indicates that during 2008 we spent $0.83 to generate each dollar of revenue, compared to $0.78 in 2007.    Income Taxes    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense. An analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods 2007 through 2009 are detailed in Table 6.    Table 6    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Income Tax Provision Analysis    (Dollars in thousands)    STYLE="font-size:12px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">                           Years ended December 31,             2009        2008        2007        (Loss) income before income tax provision      $  (50,380  )      $  (153,993  )      $  13,969         Income tax (benefit) provision      $  (20,564  )      $  (61,357  )      $  2,471         Effective income tax rate         -40.8  %         -39.8  %         17.7  %    The effective income tax rate varies from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% principally due to state income taxes, the effects of tax-exempt earnings from municipal securities and bank-owned life insurance and non-deductible compensation and business expenses. The effective tax benefit rate was marginally greater in 2009 than in 2008 primarily because of the higher proportion of tax-exempt income, relative to the loss before income taxes. This was mitigated somewhat in 2009 by a proportionally higher amount of non-deductible compensation.    The relatively low effective income tax rate for 2007 is primarily the result of the high proportion of tax-exempt income relative to income before income taxes.    Realization of Deferred Tax Assets   Net deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.   As a result of the pre-tax losses incurred during 2008 and 2009, we are in a cumulative pre-tax loss position for financial statement purposes for the three-year period ended December 31, 2009. This represents significant negative evidence in the assessment of whether the deferred tax assets will be realized. However, we have concluded that based on the weight given to other positive evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized.    In making this determination, we have considered the positive evidence associated with taxable income generated in 2009 and reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods. Most significantly, however, we have relied on our ability to generate future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences, over a relatively short time period.    Deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009 represent the aggregate of federal and state tax assets, although federal taxes represent the primary component of the balance. Future federal taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences, of approximately $191.2 million is necessary in order to fully absorb the federal deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009.         38          The Company recorded a pre-tax loss for financial statement purposes in 2009. Various book-tax differences result in the Company being in a positive taxable income position for 2009. In assessing our prospects for generating future pre-tax book income, we considered a number of factors, including: (a) our success in achieving strong and growing operating income (pre-tax, pre-provision) results during 2009; (b) the concentration of credit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio; and (c) our significant excess tangible capital position relative to well capitalized regulatory standards and other industry benchmarks. These factors support our expectation of higher pre-tax earnings in future periods. We believe this in turn should give rise to taxable income levels (exclusive of reversing temporary differences) that more likely than not would be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets over a short time period.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Operating Segments Results    We have three primary business segments: Banking (which includes our lines of business; Illinois Commercial and Specialty Banking, National Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Private Banking and Community Banking); The PrivateWealth Group; and Holding Company Activities. The PrivateBank Mortgage Company results are included in the Banking segment.    Banking    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> The profitability of each of our bank subsidiaries is primarily dependent on net interest income, provision for loan and covered asset losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Net income for the banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $4.2 million, a 107% increase from a net loss of $57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net income for the banking segment resulted primarily from an increase in both interest income and non-interest income, offset by a 33% increase in non-interest expense. The net loss for the banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $57.3 million, a decrease of 277% from net income of $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net interest income for the banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased to $347.1 million from $214.3 million in 2008 and from $142.4 million in 2007. Total loans for the banking segment increased by 13% to $9.1 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $8.0 billion at December 31, 2008. Commercial loans, including commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, continue to be the fastest-growing segment of the loan portfolio and increased to $4.7 billion, or 51% of our total loans, from $4.0 billion, or 50% of total loans at December 31, 2008. Commercial real estate loans were 31% of our total loans at December 31, 2009, compared to 30% of total loans at December 31, 2008. Total deposits increased by 27% to $10.2 billion at December 31, 2009 from $8.0 billion at December 31, 2008. Growth in non-interest bearing demand deposits, money market deposits and interest-bearing deposits accounted for the majority of the deposit growth.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"> The PrivateWealth Group    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The PrivateWealth Group segment includes investment management, personal trust and estate administration, custodial, escrow, retirement account management and brokerage services. The PrivateWealth Groups assets under management grew to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2009 as compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2008, despite a volatile year for both the equity and fixed income markets. The growth was attributable to a combination of new business and market appreciation. The PrivateWealth Groups fee revenue decreased to $15.5 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decline in fee revenue was primarily due to lower asset values during the first half of 2009 and higher levels of assets held in non-fee producing cash equivalents and lower-fee producing client relationships during the year. Net income for The PrivateWealth Group increased 21% to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $1.4 million for the same period in 2008, and up from $1.5 million for the same period in 2007. The 2009 increase in net income is attributable to lower operating costs with an emphasis on expense control and a higher net interest credit attributable to cash balances held as deposits in the Banks.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> For a number of our wealth management relationships, we utilize third-party investment managers, including Lodestar, in which The PrivateBank  Chicago has a 75% ownership position. Fees paid to third party investment managers decreased to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $3.4 million for the same period in 2007. The 2009 decrease is generally attributable to a decline in total assets managed by third-party investment managers, with an increase in assets managed in mutual funds and exchange traded funds, as well as an increase in the portion of funds that are managed by fixed income managers rather than equity managers. Fees paid to Lodestar, which are eliminated in consolidation, totaled approximately $361,000 in 2009, compared to $434,000 in 2008 and $535,000 in 2007. Of our third-party investment managers, none individually managed more than 5% of total wealth management assets under management as of December 31, 2009.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Holding Company Activities    The Holding Company Activities segment consists of parent company only matters. The Holding Companys most significant assets are its net investments in its two banking subsidiaries and its mortgage banking subsidiary. Holding Company activities are reflected        39           primarily by interest expense on borrowings, operating expenses and common and preferred dividends. Recurring holding company operating expenses consist primarily of compensation (amortization of share-based compensation) and professional fees. The Holding Company segment reported a net loss available to common stockholders of $46.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to a net loss of $35.9 million for the same period in 2008 and a net loss of $22.1 for 2007. The increase in the net loss year over year is primarily due to the payment of preferred stock dividends and an increase in non-interest expense.    ALIGN="justify"> Additional information about our operating segments are also discussed in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.   FINANCIAL CONDITION    SIZE="2"> INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT    We manage our investment portfolio to maximize the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines, to meet pledging and liquidity requirements, and to adjust balance sheet interest rate sensitivity to attempt to protect net interest income against the impact of changes in interest rates.   We adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio according to a number of factors, including expected liquidity needs, the current and forecasted interest rate environment, our actual and anticipated balance sheet growth rate, and the related value of various segments of the securities markets.    ALIGN="justify"> Investments are comprised of debt securities and non-marketable equity investments. Our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed pools and collateralized mortgage obligations.    All debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and may be sold as part of our asset/liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on the securities available-for-sale represent the difference between the aggregate cost and fair value of the portfolio and are reported, on an after-tax basis, as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. This balance sheet component will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change, thereby affecting the aggregate fair value of the portfolio.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Non-marketable equity investments include FHLB stock and other various equity securities. At December 31, 2009, our investment in FHLB stock was $22.8 million, compared to $23.7 million at December 31, 2008. Our FHLB stock holdings are necessary to qualify for FHLB advances, and we are monitoring the financial condition of the FHLBs in which we have an investment. At December 31, 2009, we held $6.6 million in other securities, which consist of equity investments to fund civic and community projects, some of which qualify for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) purposes. During 2009, we recognized losses of $514,000 on our CRA-related investments.   We do not own any Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae preferred stock or sub-debt obligations, bank trust preferred securities, nor do we own any sub-prime mortgage-backed securities.         40          The following provides a valuation summary of our investment portfolio at the date indicated.

We increased the size of the securities portfolio, and concentrated the net additions in residential mortgage backed securities between December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 primarily to improve the liquidity on our balance sheet.    Investments in mortgage related securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities comprise 87% of the available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2009 compared to 76% at December 31, 2008. Virtually all of the mortgage securities are backed by U.S. Government-owned agencies or issued by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises. All mortgage securities are composed of fixed rate, fully amortizing collateral with final maturities of 30 years or less.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Investments in debt instruments of state and local municipalities comprised 11% of the total available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2009 compared to 14% at December 31, 2008. This type of security has historically experienced very low default rates and provided a predictable cash flow since it generally is not subject to significant prepayment. Insurance companies regularly provide credit enhancement to improve the credit rating and liquidity of a municipal bond issuance. Management considers the credit enhanced and underlying municipality credit rating when evaluating a purchase or sale decision.    At December 31, 2009, our reported stockholders equity reflected unrealized securities gains net of tax of $27.9 million. This represented an increase of $328,000 from unrealized securities gains net of tax of $27.6 million at December 31, 2008.

LOAN PORTFOLIO AND CREDIT QUALITY (excluding covered assets)    ALIGN="justify"> Our principal source of revenue arises from our lending activities, primarily composed of interest income and, to a lesser extent, loan origination and commitment fees (net of related costs). The accounting policies underlying the recording of loans in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and the recognition and/or deferral of interest income and fees (net of costs) arising from lending activities are included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    The following discussion of our loan portfolio and credit quality excludes covered assets. Covered assets represent assets acquired through an FDIC-assisted transaction that are subject to a loss share agreement and are presented separately on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. For additional discussion of covered assets, see Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Portfolio Composition    Our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial, real estate (which includes commercial real estate, construction, and residential real estate) and personal loans. Outstanding loans increased by 13% to $9.1 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $8.0 billion at December 31, 2008. Commercial loans, including commercial and industrial, and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, continue to be the fastest growing segment of the loan portfolio and increased to $4.7 billion, or 51% of our total loans, from $4.0 billion, or 50% of total loans at December 31, 2008. Commercial real estate and construction decreased to 39% of total loans, or $3.5 billion, at December 31, 2009 from 40% of total loans, or $3.2 billion, at December 31, 2008.    Consistent with our emphasis on relationship banking, the majority of our loans are made to our core, multi-relationship clients. The clients usually maintain deposit relationships with us and may utilize, personally or through entities they control, other Company banking services, such as treasury management, capital markets or PrivateWealth services.    We seek to reduce our credit risk through disciplined credit underwriting combined with established loan portfolio sub-limits by loan type, collateral and industry to promote loan portfolio diversification and active credit administration. Given recent and current market conditions, we have determined to limit our growth in commercial real estate and construction loans. We do not engage in sub-prime residential lending and do not securitize our loans for sale.         42          Table 9     STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Loan Portfolio     (Dollars in thousands)    STYLE="font-size:12px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">                                             As of December 31,          2009        % of Total      2008        % of Total      2007        % of Total      2006        % of Total      2005        % of Total     Commercial      $  4,656,611         51.4      $  3,975,818         49.5      $  1,311,757         31.4      $  828,594         23.6      $  436,416         16.7     Commercial real estate         2,814,997         31.0         2,383,961         29.7         1,604,159         38.4         1,486,462         42.5         1,268,851         48.6     Construction         719,224         7.9         815,150         10.1         613,468         14.7         591,704         16.9         392,597         15.1     Residential real estate         319,463         3.5         328,138         4.1         265,466         6.4         262,107         7.5         221,786         8.5     Home equity         220,025         2.4         191,934         2.4         135,483         3.2         138,724         4.0         139,747         5.4     Personal         343,154         3.8         341,806         4.2         247,462         5.9         192,397         5.5         148,670         5.7                                                                                                      Total      $  9,073,474         100.0      $  8,036,807         100.0      $  4,177,795         100.0      $  3,499,988         100.0      $  2,608,067         100.0                                                                                                      Growth vs. prior yearend         12.9  %              92.4  %              19.4  %              34.2  %              57.7  %                                                                                               Our loan growth during 2009 slowed compared to the growth we experienced in 2008, as a result of our increased selectivity and overall economic conditions resulting in lower demand from existing clients. Growth in commercial loans of $680.8 million, or 17%, was the most significant driver of overall loan growth during 2009. This growth reflects the inclusion of new middle-market client loans originated by lenders having long term, established relationships with the clients. The $431.0 million, or 18%, growth in commercial real estate loans was spread across multiple property types with the exception of land loans, which decreased by $76 million due to the migration of some of these loans to the construction category and the strategic de-emphasis on this type of lending. During 2009, the consumer loan portfolio, which includes residential real estate, home equity and personal loans, grew by $20.8 million, or 2%.    Total gross loans increased $3.9 billion, or 92%, during 2008 compared to 2007. While all loan categories displayed strong growth since December 31, 2007, growth in commercial loans of $2.7 billion, or 203%, was the most significant driver of overall loan growth, reflecting the new middle-market client loans booked by lenders hired under our 2007 plan. The middle market lending focus of these lenders complemented the existing lenders book of business, with the new lending relationships contributing to greater loan portfolio diversification. The $779.8 million, or 49%, growth of commercial real estate loans was spread across all major property types with a greater geographic dispersion and reflects a larger average loan size for this category of credit. The $201.7 million, or 33%, growth of construction loans was tempered by the decrease in residential development loans, offsetting solid growth of non-residential construction loans. During 2008, consumer loans, which include residential real estate, home equity and personal loans, grew by $213.5 million or 33%.    Commercial Loans    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> As of December 31, 2009, commercial loans grew by $680.8 million, or 17%, to $4.7 billion compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2008. An independent review and approval of potential new lending relationships by our credit administration, and also by our loan committee for larger dollar size transactions, provides oversight for selective growth. We have a specific focus on certain specialized industries, including healthcare, construction and engineering, and security alarm services. Commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2009 generated by these teams of specialist lenders totaled $859.6 million, $213.5 million and $128.7 million, respectively. During the year we also hired a small team of asset-based lenders whose loans totaled $100 million at December 31, 2009. Our commercial loans also include loans secured by non-residential owner-occupied commercial real estate, since the cash flow of the owners business is the primary source of loan repayment; these loans total $835.9 million at December 31, 2009 and $538.7 million at December 31, 2008.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Our commercial loan portfolio is comprised of lines of credit to businesses for working capital needs, term loans for equipment and expansion, letters of credit and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. Commercial loans can contain risk factors unique to the business of each borrower. In order to mitigate these risks, we seek to gain an understanding of the business of each borrower, place appropriate value on collateral taken and structure the loan properly to make sure that collateral values are maintained through the life of the loan. Appropriate documentation of commercial loans is also important to protect our interests.    Our lines of credit typically are limited to a percentage of the value of the assets securing the line, and priced by a floating rate formula. In general, lines of credit are reviewed annually and are supported by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Depending on the risk profile of the borrower, we may require periodic aging of receivables, and inventory and equipment listings to        43           verify the quality of the borrowing base prior to advancing funds. Our term loans are also typically secured by the assets of our clients businesses. Term loans typically have maturities between one to five years, with either floating or fixed rates of interest. Commercial borrowers are required to provide updated financial statements quarterly and personal financial statements at least annually. Letters of credit are an important product to many of our clients. We issue standby or performance letters of credit, and can service the international needs of our clients through correspondent banks. We use the same underwriting standards for letters of credit as we do for funded loans.    Our commercial lending underwriting process includes an evaluation of the borrowers financial statements and projections with an emphasis on operating results, cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet proportions as well as the collateral to determine the level of creditworthiness of the borrower. Generally, these loans are secured by a first priority security interest in all the assets of the borrower and also include the support of a personal guarantee of one or more of the principals of the borrower .    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">While our loan policies have guidelines for advances on different types of collateral, we establish eligible asset values on a case-by-case basis for each borrower. As we continue to grow our middle market commercial lending business, we will offer more traditional middle market commercial loan products that will require higher monitoring of our borrowers collateralized assets and may include lending that is nonrecourse.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"> Commercial Real Estate Loans    SIZE="2">Commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2009 totaled $2.8 billion, up $431.0 million, or 18%, from $2.4 billion at December 31, 2008. The 2009 growth included the migration of loans previously reported in the construction category as these loans progressed past the construction phase and as certificates of occupancy were issued. Due to the middle-market orientation of these new larger borrowers contrasted to the smaller entrepreneurial orientation of our existing private client borrowers, the average loan size has increased and borrower type has become more diversified. Although the geographic location of the commercial real estate collateral is significantly concentrated in the Chicago metropolitan area, originations from our business development offices in Denver and Minneapolis are contributing to an increased geographic diversification of the underlying collateral. As a percentage of total loans, commercial real estate loans have decreased from 49% at December 31, 2005 to 31% at December 31, 2009. This is reflective of our strategy over the past several years to decrease the concentration of commercial real estate loans in our loan portfolio and further diversify by adding a higher mix of commercial loans.    Our commercial real estate portfolio is comprised of loans secured by various types of collateral including 1-4 family non-owner occupied housing units located primarily in the Banks target market areas, other non-owner occupied multi-family real estate, office buildings, warehouses, retail space, mixed use buildings, and vacant land, the bulk of which is held for long-term investment or development. Commercial real estate loan concentrations by collateral type are reviewed against established sub-limits as part of our credit risk management and adherence to regulatory agencies guidance. Refer to Table 10 for more detail on our commercial real estate and construction loans by collateral type.    SIZE="2">Risks inherent in real estate lending are related to the market value of the property taken as collateral, the underlying cash flows and documentation. It is important to accurately assess property values through careful review of appraisals. We mitigate these risks through review and understanding of the appraised value of the property, the ability of the cash flow generated from the collateral property to service debt, the significance of any outside income of the borrower or income from other properties owned by the borrowers, adhering to our loan documentation policies and the strength of guarantors, as applicable. Our real estate appraisal policy addresses selection of appraisers, appraisal standards, environmental issues and specific requirements for different types of properties, and has been approved by the Banks Credit Policy Committee.    SIZE="2"> Construction Loans    Construction loans at December 31, 2009 totaled $719.2 million, down $95.9 million or 12% from $815.2 million at December 31, 2008. Residential construction loans decreased by $68.4 million as a result of lower residential construction volume and our strategic decision in early 2008 to wind down our existing residential development portfolio and de-emphasize this type of lending. Non-residential construction loans decreased by $27.5 million due to the cyclical construction downturn and the lifecycle migration of loans secured by construction projects to commercial real estate loans. Over the past two years our construction portfolio has become more diversified by type of construction project. More granular construction loan collateral coding put in place during 2009 shows a well-diversified portfolio at December 31, 2009. Due to increased project complexity and its effect on completion risk associated with construction loans, in 2008 we hired dedicated construction lending specialists to monitor construction loan draws. As with commercial real estate loans, we review our construction loan concentrations as part of our risk management program and adherence to regulatory agencies guidance.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our construction loan portfolio consists of single-family residential properties, multi-family properties, and commercial projects, and includes both investment properties and properties that will be owner-occupied. As construction lending has greater inherent risk, we        44           closely monitor the status of each construction loan throughout its term. Typically, we require full investment of the borrowers equity in construction projects prior to injecting our funds. Generally, we do not allow borrowers to recoup their equity from the sale proceeds of finished product (if applicable) until we have recovered our funds on the overall project.    ALIGN="justify"> Due to the inherent risks and the monitoring requirements, our construction loans are often the highest yielding loans in our portfolio. We seek to manage these risks by, among other things, ensuring that the collateral value of the property throughout the construction process does not fall below acceptable levels, ensuring that funds disbursed are within parameters set by the original construction budget, and properly documenting each construction draw. Although we have experienced an increase in the number of construction loans that are non-performing, due to our more stringent standards for underwriting and monitoring construction loans and the credit profile of our borrowers, we are comfortable with the risk associated with this portfolio.    The following table summarizes our commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios by collateral type at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. The composition of our commercial real estate portfolio is geographically diverse, principally located in and around our core markets. No single collateral type exceeds 25% of its respective portfolio total at December 31, 2009.

During 2009 this portfolio segment decreased by $8.7 million, or 3%, from $328.1 million at December 31, 2008. Much of our residential mortgage loan production is originated through The PrivateBank Mortgage Company with the majority of originated loans sold into the secondary market. We do not generally originate long-term fixed rate loans for our own portfolio due to interest rate risk considerations.         45          Home Equity Loans    ALIGN="justify"> Home equity loans totaled $220.0 million and comprised 2% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2009 compared to $191.9 million or 2% of total loans at December 31, 2008. The growth in this segment of the portfolio reflects new loan volume as increased usage of existing facilities.    Personal Loans   At December 31, 2009, personal loans totaled $343.2 million, up $1.3 million from $341.8 million at December 31, 2008. Our personal loan portfolio consists largely of loans for investment asset acquisition and general liquidity purposes, including lines of credit. Due to our private client focus, which includes lending to entrepreneurs, some of these loans can be sizeable. We have minimal automobile loans and no credit card loans.    Loan Concentrations    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities, which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2009, commercial real estate loans and construction loans comprised 31% and 8% of our total loan portfolio, respectively. While there still is a geographic concentration of loans made to clients residing in the Chicago metropolitan area, these concentrations are lessening due to our recent expanded national presence.    ALIGN="justify"> With respect to our construction loan portfolio, the volume of residential construction loans has decreased over the past two years, reflecting the downturn in residential construction and our strategic decision to run-off our residential development portfolio. The composition of our construction loan portfolio is now predominantly loans related to commercial construction projects. The non-residential construction loans are diversified by project type and geographic location. Our commercial loan portfolio of $4.7 billion at December 31, 2009 is well-diversified with no evident industry concentrations in excess of 10% of total loans. Beginning in 2008 the addition of new commercial loans booked by the experienced middle-market lenders hired under our plan enabled us to accelerate our strategy of improving loan portfolio diversification.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity of Loan Portfolio    Table 11 summarizes the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2009, by category, as well as the interest rate sensitivity of loans in these categories that have maturities in excess of one year.

We have established policies, procedures, and practices designed to mitigate credit risk. Chief among these is the management Loan Committee process which presents selected credits based on amount and risk before a group of seasoned credit professionals which vet the loan at approval and then at appropriate intervals. Also in place to monitor and manage loan quality are standard lending and credit policies, underwriting criteria, and collateral monitoring. We monitor and implement our formal credit policies and procedures and regularly evaluate trends, collectability, and collateral protection within the loan portfolio. Our policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and modified in order to manage risk as conditions change and new credit products are offered.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Our credit administration policies include a comprehensive loan rating system. This system allows for common reference across loan types and facilitates the identification of emerging problems in loan transactions. Our internal credit review function performs regular reviews of the lending groups to assess the accuracy of loan ratings and the adherence to credit policies. Exam results are communicated to senior lending and risk management executives as well as specified Board of Director committees. Lending officers have the primary responsibility for monitoring their client relationships and effecting timely changes to loan ratings as events warrant.    In addition, our senior lenders actively review those loans that call for more extensive monitoring and may warrant some degree of remediation .  These loans are reviewed at least quarterly by a committee of senior lending and risk management officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Risk Officer, which assesses and directs actions plans to minimize the risk of these loans. More troubled loans are reviewed on a monthly basis for heightened oversight with such reviews including the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Risk Officers.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> We also maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by available and relevant information. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. We evaluate the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses based on the combined total of the general and specific reserve components. Our application of the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses resulted in an allowance for loan losses of $221.7 million at December 31, 2009 providing 2.44% coverage of total loans compared with $112.7 million providing 1.40% coverage of total loans at December 31, 2008. The increase in the allowance for loan losses from December 31, 2008 reflects managements judgment concerning the credit risk inherent in the portfolio. We believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2009.    ALIGN="justify"> In addition to the allowance for loan losses, we maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities. The reserve is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and totaled $1.5 million at December 31, 2009 compared to $840,000 at December 31, 2008. The reserve is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    The accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the allowance for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.         47          Table 12    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Allowance for Loan Losses and    Summary of Loan Loss Experience   (Dollars in thousands)                                       Years ended December 31,             2009        2008        2007        2006        2005        Change in allowance for loan losses:                                    Balance at beginning of year      $  112,672         $  48,891         $  38,069         $  29,388         $  18,986         Loans charged-off:                                    Commercial         (31,745  )         (14,926  )         (2,668  )         (976  )         (305  )      Commercial real estate         (27,565  )         (49,905  )         (1,918  )                                  Construction         (23,471  )         (54,438  )         (1,347  )                                  Residential real estate         (1,495  )         (3,022  )                                                Home equity         (1,186  )         (2,199  )                                                Personal         (15,798  )         (2,196  )         (383  )         (49  )         (233  )                                                                     Total loans charged-off         (101,260  )         (126,686  )         (6,316  )         (1,025  )         (538  )                                                                     Recoveries on loans previously charged-off:                                    Commercial         3,988            239            168            97            207         Commercial real estate         1,759            74            1                                     Construction         5,057            482                                                   Residential real estate         152            47                                                   Home equity         73            1                                                   Personal         381            45            35            55            581                                                                        Total recoveries on loans previously charged-off         11,410            888            204            152            788                                                                        Net loans (charged-off) recoveries         (89,850  )         (125,798  )         (6,112  )         (873  )         250         Provisions charged to operating expense         198,866            189,579            16,934            6,836            6,538         Reserve of acquired bank                                                   2,718            3,614                                                                        Balance at end of year      $  221,688         $  112,672         $  48,891         $  38,069         $  29,388                                                                        Allowance as a percent of loans at year-end         2.44  %         1.40  %         1.17  %         1.09  %         1.13  %                                                                     Ratio of net loans charged-off to average loans outstanding for the period         1.02  %         2.00  %         0.17  %         0.03  %         -0.01  %                                                                   We increased our allowance for loan losses to $221.7 million as of December 31, 2009, up $109.0 million from December 31, 2008. The ratio of the reserve for loan losses to loans was 2.44% as of December 31, 2009, up from 1.40% as of December 31, 2008. The provision for loan losses was $198.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, versus $189.6 million in the prior year period. The key factors in determining the level of provision is the composition of our loan portfolio, loan growth, risk rating distribution within each major loan category, historical loss experience and internal and external factors. Weakness in the general economy and, in particular, higher vacancy rates in commercial real estate, sponsor bankruptcies, declining real estate values, limited sales activity and little financing activity severely impacted our portfolio. The loan loss allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 56% at December 31, 2009 compared to 85% at December 31, 2008.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During 2009, net charge-offs totaled $89.9 million as compared to $125.8 million in the prior year period. Continued high levels of charge-offs reflect real estate collateral values, particularly land values, which have remained low. The provision for loan losses for 2009 totaled $198.9 million and exceeded net charge-offs by $109.0 million.         48          Table 13    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses    (Dollars in thousands)                                           As of December 31,          2009      % of Total Allowance      2008      % of Total Allowance      2007      % of Total Allowance      2006      % of Total Allowance      2005      % of Total Allowance     General allocated reserve:                                                            Commercial      $  43,350      20      $  39,524      35      $  8,375      17      $  5,984      16      $  6,453      22     Commercial real estate         77,223      35         31,625      28         22,909      47         19,570      51         12,975      44     Construction         23,581      10         27,231      24         9,966      20         7,509      20         4,686      16     Residential real estate         3,635      2         1,294      1         360      1         479      1         419      1     Home equity         2,862      1         1,000      1         202                 218                 277      1     Personal         5,277      2         1,527      2         2,229      5         1,877      5         1,714      6                                                                                            Total allocated         155,928      70         102,201      91         44,041      90         35,637      93         26,524      90     Specific reserve         65,760      30         330                 2,964      6         291      1                        Unallocated reserve                            10,141      9         1,886      4         2,141      6         2,864      10                                                                                            Total      $  221,688      100      $  112,672      100      $  48,891      100      $  38,069      100      $  29,388      100                                                                                          The allocated reserve for commercial real estate portfolio increased $45.6 million, or 144%, to $77.2 million at December 31, 2009 from $31.6 million at December 31, 2008 and is largely due to the credit degradation experienced in the portfolio as well as general economic concerns surrounding the commercial real estate sector. The allocated reserve for our consumer loans (residential real estate, home equity, and personal) increased $8.0 million, or 208%, to $11.8 million at December 31, 2009 from $3.8 million at December 31, 2008 and is attributable to deterioration in credit performance experienced during 2009 and general concerns surrounding the consumer sector.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Under our methodology, the allowance for loan losses is comprised of the following components:    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> General Allocated Component of the Allowance    The general allocated component of the allowance increased by $53.7 million during 2009, from $102.2 million at December 31, 2008 to $155.9 million at December 31, 2009. The magnitude of the dollar increase in the general allocated portion of the allowance reflects loan rating downgrades throughout the year and higher loan volumes.    Our loan loss allowance model is driven primarily by risk rating distribution and historical loss experience within each major loan category, and internal and external factors. The loan loss factors used in our analysis reflect the significant losses realized during 2009, providing us current experience upon which to base our models results. The level of the allowance for loan losses is also a judgment and reflects our current view of market conditions and portfolio performance.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> During 2009, we began using amplification factors reflecting these judgments to adjust the loss factors in our model which allows us to fully allocate the general reserves across the loan categories.    Specific Component of the Allowance    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> For loans where management deems either the amount or the timing of the repayment to be significantly impaired, there are specific reserve allocations established. The specific reserve is based on a loans current value compared to the present value of its projected future cash flows, collateral value or market value, as is relevant for the particular loan. At December 31, 2009, the specific component of the allowance increased by $65.4 million to $65.8 million from $330,000 at December 31, 2008.    SIZE="2"> Nonperforming Assets and Delinquent Loans    Nonperforming loans include loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest, loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued and loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest and principal due to a weakening of the borrowers financial condition.    Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition.         49          Generally commercial, commercial real estate and constructions loans are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be in question. Loans to customers whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for non-accrual status whether or not the loan is 90 days or more past due.    Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as non-accrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest.    Foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs at time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses. On an ongoing basis, the book values of these properties are adjusted based upon new appraisals and/or market indications. Write-downs are recorded for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties. We are actively marketing properties acquired through foreclosure.    SIZE="2">Given current economic conditions and the uncertainty regarding the real estate market, the time involved to sell these properties has extended, resulting in higher levels of other real estate owned and associated maintenance costs in 2009.   90 days past due loans are loans for which principal or interest payments become 90 days past due but that still accrue interest since they are loans that are well secured and in the process of collection.

doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms should be identified as a non-performing loan and should be included in Table 15, Nonperforming Assets and Past Due Loans, presented above. Accordingly, at the periods presented in this report, we had no potential problem loans as defined by the SEC regulations.         51          As shown in Table 16, three borrowers comprise 67% of non-accruing commercial loans. This highlights the fact that the average size of our new production is larger and a reflection of the clients we are targeting. We recognize that as such exposure increases it requires careful monitoring, and even more so in this difficult economy.   The level and composition of our nonperforming loans has changed over the past three years, reflecting primarily the acceleration of economic weakness and a tightening of our non-accrual loan policy and past due loan management.

We continue to actively work with our clients to determine the best solution to maximize value. During 2009 we aligned the portfolio by geographic region and augmented our loan work-out staff in response to deteriorating credit trends. Further, our Loan Administration Committee establishes and reviews appropriate action plans for payment resolution on all nonperforming assets, including OREO properties. Action plans determined for each nonperforming asset is dependent upon borrower cooperation and resources, collateral type and value, existence and quality of guarantees and local market conditions.         53          As we look to dispose of nonperforming assets, our efforts could be impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the pace and timing of the overall recovery of the economy, instability in the real estate market, higher levels of real estate coming into the market, and planned liquidation strategies. Accordingly, the future carrying value of these assets may be influenced by these same factors.

Of total deposits at December 31, 2009, $803.8 million in deposits are attributable to the Founders transaction. Client deposits increased by $3.3 billion, or 55%, to $9.3 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2008. During 2009, we continued to facilitate our deposit growth by pursuing deposits from existing and new clients, increasing institutional and municipal deposits, attracting additional business DDA account balances through our enhanced treasury management services, and increasing use of our CDARS STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1"> ®  deposit program. Total non-interest bearing deposits increased $1.1 million, or 159%, at December 31, 2009 from December 31, 2008.    Brokered deposits totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2009, down 41% from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2008 due primarily to our strategic decision to reduce our reliance on traditional brokered deposits and non-client CDARS STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">®  deposits as a funding source. As a result we have shifted to the utilization of client deposits as a key funding source to support our funding needs and growth in the loan portfolio.

They provide us with a more reliable, lower cost, short-term funding source than what is available through other wholesale alternatives. These relationships also provide numerous cross-sell and business referral opportunities. At December 31, 2009, we had public funds on account totaling $373.6 million, of which less than 49% were collateralized with securities. Year-to-year changes in balances are influenced by the tax collection activities of the various municipalities as well as the general level of interest rates.

In the event that certain of these certificates of deposits are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the Banks, those deposits will be replaced with traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowed money or capital, or we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs.

Due to the consolidation of our bank subsidiaries (other than The PrivateBank  Wisconsin) into The PrivateBankChicago, and because The PrivateBankChicago is not a Federal Home Loan Bank member, we have limited access to additional FHLB borrowings.

Such obligations generally relate to the funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances, as well as leases for premises and equipment. As a financial services provider, we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit. While contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process as all comparable loans we make.

Our commitments to fund civic and community investments, which represent future cash outlays for the construction and development of properties for low-income housing, small business real estate, and historic tax credit projects that qualify for CRA purposes, are not included in the contractual obligations table above. The timing and amounts of these commitments are projected based upon the financing arrangements provided in each projects partnership or operating agreement, and could change due to variances in the construction schedule, project revisions, or the cancellation of the project.

SIZE="1">     57          Issuance of Preferred Stock    ALIGN="justify"> On January 30, 2009, we sold 243,815 shares of a newly created class of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B to the Treasury as part of the TARP CPP Program. We also issued to the Treasury a ten-year warrant to purchase up to approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock, or 15% of the aggregate dollar amount of Series B preferred shares purchased by the Treasury, at an exercise price of $28.35 per share. In December 2009 as a result of the completion of the 2009 offerings, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant held by the U.S. Treasury was reduced by 50 percent from 1,290,026 to 645,013 shares. The Series B preferred stock and warrants qualify for regulatory Tier 1 capital and the preferred stock may be redeemed at any time subject to regulatory approval. Following a redemption of the preferred stock, the warrants may be liquidated by the U.S. Treasury, through either a redemption at market prices or through a sale by the U.S. Treasury to a third party. The preferred stock has a dividend rate of 5% for the first five years, increasing to 9% thereafter. Among other things, we are subject to restrictions and conditions including those related to the payment of dividends on our common stock, share repurchases, executive compensation, and corporate governance. We have deployed this new capital mainly to support prudent new lending in the markets we serve. Refer to 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) in Supervision and Regulation and Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Item 1 and Item 8, respectively, of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the CPP and TARP programs.    Issuance of Common Stock    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> In order to maintain a strong balance sheet during this challenging economic period and to complement deposits and borrowings as a funding source for our loan growth, we undertook two common equity raises during the year, in addition to converting existing preferred shares to common capital.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In May 2009, we issued approximately 11.6 million shares of newly issued common stock at a public offering price of $19.25 per share. We granted the underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1.74 million shares which they partially exercised and purchased an additional 266,673 shares. The net proceeds from the offering, including the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, were approximately $217 million after deducting underwriting commissions but before offering expenses.    In June 2009, we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (1) create a new class of non-voting common stock (the Non-voting Common Stock), and (2) amend and restate the Certificate of Designations of the Companys Series A Junior Nonvoting Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) to provide, among other things, that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible only into shares of Non-voting Common Stock. Under the amended terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of Non-voting Common Stock. On June 17, 2009, we issued 1,951,037 shares of Non-voting Common Stock to GTCR upon notice of conversion by GTCR of all of its 1,951.037 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. This transaction resulted in a reclassification of preferred stock capital to common stock capital and did not increase total stockholders equity. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock held and converted by GTCR represented all of the authorized, issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock on such date. We also entered into an amendment to our existing Preemptive and Registration Rights Agreement with GTCR pursuant to which we agree, among other things, to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the newly issued shares of Non-voting Common Stock for resale under the Securities Act of 1933.    ALIGN="justify"> On November 2, 2009, we closed an underwritten public offering of common stock, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option, and issued a total of approximately 22.2 million shares for net proceeds of approximately $181.2 million after deducting underwriting commissions. Of that amount, approximately $35.3 million was purchased by certain funds managed by GTCR. In addition, GTCR purchased approximately $12.8 million of non-voting common stock of the Company, equating to 1.6 million shares, through an exercise of its existing preemptive rights.    ALIGN="justify"> The net proceeds from both the 2009 public offerings, as well as from the sale of non-voting common stock, qualify as tangible common equity and Tier 1 capital and are being used to further capitalize our subsidiary banks in order to support continued growth and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including possible FDIC-assisted acquisition transactions subject to satisfying eligibility requirements to participate in such transactions.    Capital Measurements    ALIGN="justify"> A strong capital position relative to the capital adequacy rules that apply to us is crucial in maintaining investor confidence, accessing capital markets, and enabling us to take advantage of future profitable growth opportunities. Our Capital Policy requires that we maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines. It serves as an internal discipline in analyzing business risks and internal growth opportunities and sets targeted levels of return on equity. Under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, we are subject to various capital requirements set and administered by the federal banking agencies. These requirements specify        58           minimum capital ratios, defined as Tier 1 and total capital as a percentage of assets and off-balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories and a leverage ratio calculated as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets. We have managed our capital ratios to consistently maintain such measurements in excess of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) minimum levels considered to be well capitalized, which is the highest capital category established.    The following table presents our consolidated measures of capital as of the dates presented and the capital guidelines established by the FRB to be categorized as well capitalized.    ALIGN="center"> Table 23    Capital Measurements    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"> (Dollars in thousands)                               December 31, 2009        December 31, 2008        Regulatory Minimum For SIZE="1"> Well Capitalized        Excess Over Required Minimums at 12/31/09     Regulatory capital ratios:                          Total capital to risk-weighted assets      14.65  %      10.32  %      10.00  %      $  504,379     Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets      12.29  %      7.24  %      6.00  %         681,356     Tier 1 leverage to average assets      11.17  %      7.17  %      5.00  %         735,758     Other capital ratios:                          Tangible common equity to tangible assets  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(1)      7.41  %      4.49  %                Tangible equity to tangible assets STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(2)      9.40  %      5.07  %                Tangible equity to risk-weighted assets STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(2)      10.36  %      5.45  %                Total equity to total assets STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(3)      10.25  %      6.03  %                   (1) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    Ratio is not subject to formal FRB regulatory guidance and is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure.

The Tier 1 qualifying amount is limited to 25% of Tier 1 capital under FRB regulations.

For further details of the regulatory capital requirements and ratios as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, for the Company and the Banks, refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.   Dividends    We declared dividends of $0.04 per common share during 2009. Based on the closing stock price at December 31, 2009 of $8.97, the annualized dividend yield on our common stock was 0.45%. Our ability to increase common stock dividends is subject to the applicable restrictions of the CPP relating to the sale of the preferred stock from the TARP program. Please refer to EESA in Supervision and Regulation of Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the CPP and TARP programs. Dividend payments by the Company are also subject to the provisions set forth in policies of the FRB.    The dividend payout ratio, which represents the percentage of dividends declared to stockholders to earnings per share, was -4.2% for 2009 and -9.5% for 2008. The dividend payout ratio has averaged approximately 14.0% for the past five years.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"> Stock Repurchase Program    SIZE="2">Our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to the applicable restrictions of the CPP following the sale of the preferred stock to the Treasury under the TARP program. Please refer to EESA in Supervision and Regulation of Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the CPP and TARP programs.    In connection with restrictions on stock repurchases as part of the CPP, we terminated our repurchase program in February 2009. The restrictions on repurchases will not affect our ability to repurchase shares in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans as such transactions are in the ordinary course and consistent with our past practice. During 2009 we repurchased 6,190 shares with a value of $9.95 per share with all repurchases associated with shares submitted in satisfaction of taxes and/or exercise price amounts in connection with the settlement of share-based compensation awards.         59          MARKET AND INTEREST RATE RISK    ALIGN="justify"> We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities. We have used derivatives in past years as an interest rate risk management tool and may use such instruments in the future; however we currently do not have any such instruments on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.    Changes in market rates give us the opportunity to make changes to our investment securities portfolio as part of the implementation of our asset liability management strategies. Our net interest margin increased to 3.06% during 2009, as compared to 2.73% at December 31, 2008. During 2009, the declining cost on wholesale funds, short-term borrowings and deposits caught up with the downward repricing of our interest earning assets, both resulting from the decline in short term LIBOR rates and prime rate in 2008. Approximately 49% of the loan portfolio is indexed to LIBOR, 29% of the loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate of interest, and another 4% of the total loan portfolio, otherwise adjusts with other short-term interest rates.    ALIGN="justify"> During 2009, we slowed the pace of fixed rate investment securities purchases as compared to 2008. Therefore, with the continued increase in floating rate loan assets in 2009, the our net interest income has become more sensitive to changes in interest rates at December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. We will continue to consider the use of interest rate swaps in the future depending on changes in market rates of interest and our balance sheet structure to further mange our position.    LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> The objectives of liquidity risk management are to ensure that we can meet our cash flow requirements, capitalize on business opportunities in a timely and cost effective manner and satisfy regulatory guidelines for liquidity imposed by bank regulators. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements, assessing concentration risks and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet our clients needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events. Liquidity is secured by managing the mix of financial instruments on the balance sheet and expanding potential sources of liquidity.    We manage liquidity at two levels: at the holding company level and at the bank subsidiary level. The management of liquidity at both levels is essential because the holding company and banking subsidiaries each have different funding needs and sources. Liquidity management is guided by policies formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks asset/liability committees, which take into account the marketability of assets, the sources and stability of funding market conditions, the level of unfunded commitments and potential future loan and deposit growth.    We also develop and maintain contingency funding plans, which evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances and allow us to ensure that we would be able to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding is constrained. The plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress, specify and quantify sources of liquidity, outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period, and define roles and responsibilities. The plans are reviewed and approved annually by the Asset and Liability Committee of each subsidiary bank.    Our bank subsidiaries principal sources of funds are client deposits, including large institutional deposits, wholesale market-based borrowings, capital contributions by the parent company, and cash from operations. Our bank subsidiaries principal uses of funds include funding growth in the core asset portfolios, including loans, and to a lesser extent, our investment portfolio, which is used primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk. The primary sources of funding for the holding company include dividends received from its bank subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of senior, subordinated and convertible debt, as well as equity. Primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt, interest paid to our debt holders, dividends paid to stockholders, and subsidiary funding through capital contributions.    Our client deposits, the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long-term relationships generally established with our clients, are available to provide long-term liquidity for our bank subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009, 77% of our total assets were funded by client deposits, compared to 60% at December 31, 2008. Client deposits for purposes of this ratio are defined to include all deposits less traditional brokered deposits and non-client CDARS STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">® . Time deposits are included as client deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:0px;" ALIGN="justify"> While we first look toward internally generated deposits as a funding source, we continue to utilize wholesale funding sources, including brokered deposits, in order to enhance liquidity and to fund our loan growth. However, during 2009, we made a strategic decision to rely less heavily on brokered deposits as a funding source. Brokered deposits, excluding client CDARS ® , decreased to 6%        60           of total deposits at December 31, 2009, compared to 25% of total deposits at December 31, 2008. During the fourth quarter 2009, we notified our brokers of our intent to call $94.0 million in brokered deposits during the first half of 2010. Our asset/liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered deposits excluding reciprocal CDARS STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">®  to levels no more than 40% of total deposits, and total brokered deposits to levels no more than 50% of total deposits. We do not expect these threshold limitations to limit our ability to grow. Refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A in this Form 10-K for additional disclosures regarding our liquidity.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Liquid assets refer to cash on hand, federal funds sold, as well as available-for-sale securities. Net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and certain deposits that require collateral. At December 31, 2009, net liquid assets at the bank subsidiaries were $906.5 million at December 31, 2009 and $713.1 million at December 31, 2008.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Net cash inflows provided by operations were $87.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net cash outflows from investing activities were $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $4.9 billion for prior year. Cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $2.0 billion compared to $5.0 billion in 2008.    Our subsidiary banks had unused overnight fed funds borrowings available for use of $376.0 million at December 31, 2009 and $171.0 million at December 31, 2008. Our total availability of overnight fed fund borrowings is not a committed line of credit and is dependent upon lender availability. At December 31, 2009, we also had $1.3 billion in borrowing capacity through the FRB discount windows primary credit program, which includes federal term auction facilities. Our borrowing capacity changes each quarter subject to available collateral and FRB discount factors.    During the first half of 2009, we redeemed all of the $115.0 million in outstanding principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes at a redemption price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The senior convertible notes were issued in March 2007 and paid interest semi-annually at a fixed rate of 3.63% per annum. The notes were convertible under certain circumstances into cash and, if applicable, shares of the Companys common stock at an initial conversion price of $45.05 per share and were scheduled to mature on March 15, 2027.    During the first quarter 2009, we repaid in full $20.0 million under the credit facility. The credit facility matured in the third quarter 2009 and was not renewed by us.    IMPACT OF INFLATION    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry. Under these principles and practices, we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.    Unlike many industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation.    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry. Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to our financial position and results of operations. Application of critical accounting policies requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments based on information available at the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future changes in information may affect these estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which, in turn, may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.    SIZE="2">We have numerous accounting policies, of which the most significant are presented in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Item 8 of this Form 10-K. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other consolidated financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has determined that our accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to our financial position and results of operations, and, as such, are considered to be critical accounting policies, as discussed below.         61          Allowance for Loan Losses    ALIGN="justify"> We maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based on a review of available and relevant information. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. Our allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly to determine the appropriate level of the allowance. The amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on a variety of factors, including, among other factors, assessment of the credit risk of the loans in the portfolio, delinquent loans, impaired loans, evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area, actual charge-offs and recoveries during the period, industry loss averages and historical loss experience.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Management adjusts the allowance for loan losses by recording a provision for loan losses in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at the level determined appropriate. Loans are charged-off when deemed to be uncollectible by management.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability.    Goodwill is allocated to business segments at acquisition. Fair values of reporting units are determined using either market-based valuation multiples for comparable businesses if available, or discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired.    Goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired, a noncash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded in earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value, step one. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and step two is not considered necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the impairment test continues (step two) by comparing the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value is computed by adjusting all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to current fair value with the offset adjustment to goodwill. The adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value of the goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying fair value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.   During 2009, in addition to our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2009, we completed an impairment test during the first quarter. In both tests, the step one analysis conducted for the PrivateWealth segment indicated that the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value (including goodwill). Therefore, a step two analysis was not required for this reporting unit.    The step one analysis completed for the Banking segment indicated that the carrying value (including goodwill) of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The annual valuation utilized market and income approach methodologies and applied a weighted average to each in order to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. Therefore, a step two analysis was performed for this segment, which indicated that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the Banking segment exceeded the carrying value (including goodwill) and no impairment charge was recorded in 2009.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Goodwill impairment testing is considered a critical accounting estimate as estimates and assumptions are made about future performance and cash flows, as well as other prevailing market factors. We engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the computation of the fair value estimates of each reporting unit as part of its impairment assessment. In connection with obtaining an independent third party valuation, management provides certain information and assumptions that is utilized in the implied fair value calculation. Assumptions critical to the process include discount rates, asset and liability growth rates, and other income and expense estimates. We provided the best information currently available to estimate future performance for each reporting unit; however, future adjustments to these projections may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions utilized in making these assumptions.         62          Identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and are subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All of the other intangible assets have finite lives which are amortized over varying periods not exceeding 15 years and include core deposit premiums that use an accelerated method of amortization and client relationship intangibles and assembled workforce which are amortized on a straight line basis.    Income Taxes    ALIGN="justify"> The determination of income tax expense or benefit, and the amounts of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on a complex analyses of many factors, including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws, current financial accounting standards, the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities (temporary differences), assessments of the likelihood that the reversals of deferred deductible temporary differences will yield tax benefits and estimates of reserves required for tax uncertainties.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are subject to the federal income tax laws of the United States and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business. We periodically undergo examination by various governmental taxing authorities. Such authorities may require that changes in the amount of tax expense be recognized when their interpretations of tax law differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions, new interpretations of existing law or positions by federal or state taxing authorities, will not result in tax liability amounts that differ from our current assessment of such amounts, the impact of which could be significant to future results.    Temporary differences may give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods based on weighing both positive and negative evidence and establish a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets for which recovery is unlikely, based on a standard of more likely than not. In making this assessment, we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize these assets through: (a) the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, (b) future taxable income, (c) the possible application of future tax planning strategies, and (d) carryback to taxable income in prior years. We have not established a valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009. However, there is no guarantee that the tax benefits associated with these deferred tax assets will be fully realized. We have concluded, as of December 31, 2009, that it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In the preparation of income tax returns, tax positions are taken based on interpretation of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of such positions may not be certain. We periodically review and evaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for tax benefits that may not be realized. The amount of any such reserves are based on the standards for determining such reserves as set forth in current accounting guidance and our estimates of amounts that may ultimately be due or owed (including interest). These estimates may change from time to time based on our evaluation of developments subsequent to the filing of the income tax return, such as tax authority audits, court decisions or other tax law interpretations. There can be no assurance that any tax reserves will be sufficient to cover tax liabilities that may ultimately be determined to be owed. At December 31, 2009, we had $667,000 of tax reserves established relating to uncertain tax positions that would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized in future periods.    ALIGN="justify"> For additional discussion of income taxes, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    SIZE="2"> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    As a continuing part of our financial strategy, we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income. This effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield. Our asset/liability management policy is established by the business risk committee of our Board of Directors and is monitored by management. Our asset/liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate. These standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations, liquidity, loan limits as a percentage of funding sources, exposure to correspondent banks and brokers, and reliance on non-core deposits. The policy also states our reporting requirements to our Board of Directors. The investment policy complements the asset/liability management policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities. These criteria include approved types of securities, brokerage sources, terms of investment, quality standards, and diversification.    One way to estimate the potential impact of interest rate changes on our income statement is a gap analysis. The gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to re-pricing in specified time periods. During any given time period, if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets, a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time. Conversely, a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates.         63          We have structured our assets and liabilities to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment. We manage our gap position at the one-year horizon. Depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short- and long-term, we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset/liability management policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. There are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our consolidated income statement.    The following tables present the estimated interest rate sensitivity and periodic and cumulative gap positions calculated as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

simulation model based on our interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability portfolios, assuming the size of these portfolios remains constant throughout the twelve month measurement period. The simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis. Assets and liabilities then re-price based on current terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period. The model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred. The following table shows the estimated impact of an immediate change in interest rates as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.    STYLE="margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"> Analysis of Net Interest Income Sensitivity    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(Dollars in thousands)                                       Immediate Change in Rates             -50        +50        +100        +200        +300        December 31, 2009:                                    Dollar change      $  6,623         $  21,576         $  31,959         $  54,568         $  79,604         Percent change         1.8  %         5.8  %         8.6  %         14.7  %         21.5  %      December 31, 2008:                                    Dollar change      $  (1,861  )      $  2,766         $  5,151         $  9,476         $  14,911         Percent change         -0.9  %         1.4  %         2.5  %         4.7  %         7.3  %    The estimated impact to our net interest income over a one year period is reflected in dollar terms and percentage change. As an example, this table illustrates that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of +100 basis points on December 31, 2009, net interest income would increase by $32.0 million or 8.6% over a one-year period, as compared to a net interest income increase of $5.2 million or 2.5% if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of +100 basis points at December 31, 2008.    Changes in the effect on net interest income at December 31, 2009, compared to December 31, 2008 are due to the timing and nature of the re-pricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame. While the percent of net interest income is relatively consistent across the rate scenarios, the absolute dollar impact has increased in each scenario due to increases in        65           our interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability portfolios. During 2009, we slowed the growth in our fixed rate bond portfolio relative to 2008. The slowing of our fixed rate bond portfolio, and continued floating rate loan growth, funded by an increasing percentage of client deposits results in a balance sheet more sensitive to interest rate changes at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. As the absolute level of short-term rates has dropped, more of our loans are approaching or hitting their floors, which has the result of moderating further rate sensitivity in falling rates.    ALIGN="justify"> The preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve, prepayments on loans and securities, changes in deposit levels, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others. While our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates. We have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets, purchase or sell investment securities, or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk.

STYLE="font-size:12px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">     1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Nature of Operations  - PrivateBancorp, Inc. (PrivateBancorp or the Company) was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1989 to serve as the holding company for The PrivateBank and Trust Company (PrivateBank  Chicago), a de novo bank. We completed our initial public offering in June of 1999 and currently have two bank subsidiaries (the Banks) that operate through 23 offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Des Moines, Detroit, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and St. Louis metropolitan areas. PrivateBancorp, through its PrivateBank subsidiaries, provides distinctive, highly personalized financial services to a growing array of successful middle market privately-held and public businesses, affluent individuals, wealthy families, professionals, entrepreneurs and real estate investors. We deliver a sophisticated suite of tailored credit and noncredit solutions, including lending, treasury management, investment products, capital markets products, and wealth management and trust services to meet our clients commercial and personal needs. Our clients also have access to mortgage loans offered through The PrivateBank Mortgage Company, a subsidiary of PrivateBancorp.    Principles of Consolidation  - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Assets held in a fiduciary or agency capacity are not assets of the subsidiaries and, accordingly, are not included in the consolidated financial statements.    SIZE="2"> Basis of Presentation  - Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, management has defined cash and cash equivalents to include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and other short-term investments. Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods, but not longer than 30 days. Short-term investments generally mature in less than 30 days. We use the accrual basis of accounting for financial reporting purposes.    In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we have evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition or disclosure in the annual report on Form 10-K through March 1, 2010, the date on which the consolidated financial statements were issued. Refer to Note 24, Subsequent Events for the required disclosures.    Use of Estimates  - The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and general practice within the banking industry. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies adhered to in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.    Business Combinations  - Business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, assets and liabilities of the business acquired are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition, with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the effective date of acquisition.    Investment Securities Available-for-Sale  - At the time of purchase, investment securities are classified as available-for-sale as management has the intent and ability to hold such securities for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell available-for-sale securities would be based on various factors, including, but not limited to asset/liability management strategies, changes in interest rates or prepayment risks, liquidity needs, or regulatory capital considerations. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, recorded in stockholders equity as a separate component of other comprehensive income (OCI).    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The historical cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts over the estimated life of the security, using the level-yield method. In determining the estimated life of a mortgage-backed security, certain judgments are required as to the timing and amount of future principal prepayments. These judgments are made based on the actual performance of the underlying security and the general market consensus regarding changes in mortgage interest rates and underlying prepayment estimates. Amortization of premium and accretion of discount are included in interest income from the related security.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Purchases and sales of securities are recognized on a trade date basis. Realized securities gains or losses are reported in securities gains (losses), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. On a quarterly basis, we make an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or circumstances to indicate that a security for which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary (OTTI) basis. This determination requires        74           significant judgment. OTTI is considered to have occurred (1) if management intends to sell the security, (2) if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the present value of the expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For debt securities that we do not expect to sell or it is not more likely than not to be required to sell, the OTTI is separated into credit and noncredit components. The credit-related OTTI, represented by the expected loss in principal, is recognized in non-interest income, while noncredit-related OTTI is recognized in OCI. Noncredit-related OTTI results from other factors, including increased liquidity spreads and extension of the security. For securities which we do expect to sell, all OTTI is recognized in earnings. Presentation of OTTI is made in the income statement on a gross basis with a reduction for the amount of OTTI recognized in OCI. Once an other-than-temporary impairment is recorded, when future cash flows can be reasonably estimated, future cash flows are re-allocated between interest and principal cash flows to provide for a level-yield on the security.    Loans Held for Sale  - Loans held for sale (LHFS) represent mortgage loan originations intended to be sold in the secondary market and other loans that management has an active plan to sell. LHFS may be carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined on an aggregate basis by type of loan or carried at fair value where the Company has elected fair value accounting. The credit component of any write-down upon transfer of loans to LHFS is reflected in charge-offs. Where an election is made to subsequently carry the LHFS at fair value, any further decreases or subsequent increases in fair value are recognized in non-interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Where an election is made to subsequently carry LHFS at lower of cost or fair value (as is the case with mortgage loan originations), any further decreases are recognized in mortgage banking revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income and increases in fair value are not recognized until the loans are sold. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates or, in the case where a firm commitment has been made to sell the loan, the firm committed price. Gains and losses on the disposition of loans held for sale are determined on the specific identification method. Mortgage loans sold in the secondary market are sold without retaining servicing rights.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Loans  - Loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees or costs, and any direct principal charge-offs. Interest income on loans is accrued based on principal amounts outstanding. Loan origination fees, fees for commitments that are expected to be exercised and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net amount amortized over the estimated life of the related loan or commitment period as a yield adjustment. Other credit-related fees are recognized as fee income when earned.    ALIGN="justify"> Nonaccrual Loans  -  Generally, loans (including impaired loans) are designated as nonaccrual: (a) when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms unless the loan is sufficiently collateralized such that full repayment of both principal and interest is expected and is in the process of collection; or (b) when an individual analysis of a borrowers creditworthiness indicates a credit should be placed on nonaccrual status. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Future interest income may only be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the financial position of the borrower and other relevant factors indicate there is no longer doubt as to such collectability.    Loans are generally charged-off when deemed uncollectible. A loss is recorded at that time if the net realizable value can be quantified and it is less than the associated principal and interest.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Impaired Loans  -  A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled interest payments. When a loan has been identified as being impaired, the amount of impairment will be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or, when appropriate, the loans observable fair value or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. All loans subject to evaluation and considered to be impaired are included in nonperforming assets.    If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (including accrued interest, net of deferred loan fees and costs and unamortized premium or discount), impairment is recognized by creating a specific reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Restructured Loans  -  In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is classified as a restructured loan. Modifications may include principal forgiveness, forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. The allowance for loan losses on restructured loans is determined by discounting the restructured cash flows by the original effective rate. Loans restructured at a rate equal to or greater than that of a new loan with comparable risk at the time the contract is modified may be excluded from the impairment assessment and may cease to be considered impaired loans in the calendar years subsequent to the restructuring if they are in compliance with modified terms.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">      75          Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured remains on nonaccrual for a period of six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However, performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered when assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual at the time of the restructuring or after a shorter performance period. If the borrowers ability to meet the revised payment schedule is uncertain, the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan.    Allowance for Loan Losses  - The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature, volume, size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, an assessment of individual problem loans, actual and anticipated loss experience, current economic conditions that affect the borrowers ability to pay and other pertinent factors. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expense through the provision for loan and covered asset losses. The amount charged to operating expense in any given year is dependent upon a number of factors including historic loan growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, net charge-off levels, and our assessment of the allowance for loan losses based on the methodology discussed below.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The allowance for loan losses consists of two components calculated based on estimations performed pursuant to the requirements of current accounting guidance. The allowance for loan losses consists of: (i) general allocated reserves based on loan portfolio composition, risk rating distribution across loan type, historical losses and regional internal and external factors impacting bank performance; and (ii) specific reserves established for expected losses on individual loans as discussed in impaired loans above.    Reserve for Unfunded Commitments  - We maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities. The reserve is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The reserve is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Purchased Loans  - Purchased loans acquired through portfolio purchases or in a business combination are accounted for under specialized accounting rules when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that not all contractual payments will be collected (purchased impaired loans). Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and non-accrual status, declines in current borrower FICO scores, geographic concentration and declines in current loan-to-value ratios. U.S. GAAP requires these loans to be recorded at fair value at acquisition date and prohibits the carrying over or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting for loans acquired in a transfer.    The fair values for loans within the scope of the specialized accounting rules are determined by discounting both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value. We estimate the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition using internal models that incorporate managements best estimate of current key assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and payment speeds.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Under the specialized accounting rules, any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method when there is a reasonable expectation about amount and timing of such cash flows. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for covered asset losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for covered asset losses to the extent of prior charges or a reclassification of the difference from non-accretable to accretable with a positive impact on interest income.    For purchased loans not subject to the specialized accounting rules, differences between the purchase price and the unpaid principal balance at the date of acquisition are recorded in interest income over the life of the loan. Incurred credit losses are recorded at the purchase date through an allowance for credit losses. Decreases in expected cash flows after the purchase date are recognized by recording an additional allowance for credit losses.         76          Covered Assets  - Purchased loans and foreclosed loan collateral covered under loss sharing or similar credit protection agreements with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are reported separately on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition inclusive of the fair value of expected reimbursement cash flows the Company expects to receive from the FDIC under those agreements. Similarly, credit losses on those assets are determined net of the expected reimbursement from the FDIC.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Other Real Estate Owned  - Other real estate owned (OREO) is comprised of property acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in partial or total satisfaction of certain loans. Properties are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan at the time of acquisition or the fair value, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Any write-downs in the carrying value of a property at the time of acquisition are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent write-downs to reflect current fair market value, as well as gains or losses on disposition and revenues or expenses incurred in maintain such properties are treated as period costs and reported in non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Depreciable Assets  - Premises, furniture and equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is determined by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the life of the asset or the lease term. Rates of depreciation are generally based on the following useful lives: buildings, 30-40 years; leasehold improvements, typically 1-16 years; and furniture and equipment, 3-7 years. Gains on dispositions are included in other income, and losses on dispositions are included in other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses as incurred, while improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining life.    SIZE="2">Long-lived depreciable assets are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the expected undiscounted future cash flows of a long-lived asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, the Company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset based on a quoted market price, if applicable, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses are recorded in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    SIZE="2"> Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI)  - BOLI represents life insurance policies on the lives of certain Company officers for which the Company is the beneficiary. These policies are recorded as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at their cash surrender value, or the amount that could be realized currently. The change in cash surrender value and insurance proceeds received are recorded as BOLI income in non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  - Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level at least annually for impairment or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. The Company has determined that its operating segments qualify as reporting units under U.S. GAAP. Fair values of reporting units are determined using either market-based valuation multiples for comparable businesses if available, or discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and are subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All of the Companys other intangible assets have finite lives and are amortized over varying periods not exceeding 15 years.    Fiduciary Assets and Assets Under Management  - Assets held in a fiduciary capacity for clients are not included in the consolidated financial statements as they are not assets of the Company or its subsidiaries. Fiduciary and asset management fees are generally determined based upon market values of assets under management as of a specified date during the period and are included as a component of non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    ALIGN="justify"> Brokered Deposits  - We utilize brokered deposits as liquidity and asset-liability management tools in the normal course of business. Certain brokered deposits we issue contain a purchased option, retained by us, to call (redeem) the brokered deposit prior to maturity at a specified date. Upon issuance of brokered deposits, we recognize a liability that reflects the fees paid to brokers for raising the funds in the retail market. The deferred broker commissions are amortized to interest expense as an adjustment to the brokered deposit yield over the contractual maturity of the brokered deposit. In the event we notify the certificate holders of our intent to exercise the call option on the callable brokered deposit, the remaining unamortized broker commissions are amortized to the call date.    Advertising Costs  - All advertising costs are expensed in the period they are incurred.         77          Loss Contingencies  - Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Derivative Financial Instruments  - In the ordinary course of business, we enter into derivative transactions as part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as either other assets or other liabilities. Subsequent changes in a derivatives fair value are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.    On the date we enter into a derivative contract, we designate the derivative instrument as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or as a freestanding derivative instrument. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered to be fair value hedges. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows to be received or paid related to an asset or liability or other types of forecasted transactions are considered to be cash flow hedges. We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.    For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge and are effective, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income. The unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (for example, when a hedged item is terminated or redesignated). For all hedge relationships, derivative gains and losses not effective in hedging the change in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of change.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">At the hedges inception and at least quarterly thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future. If a derivative instrument designated as a hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively and the gain or loss is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged asset or liability (fair value hedge) or over the same period(s) that the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings (cash flow hedge). If the hedged item is disposed of, or the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, any fair value adjustments are included in the gain or loss from the disposition of the hedged item. In the case of a forecasted transaction that is no longer probable, the gain or loss is included in earnings immediately.    We also offer various derivative products to clients and enter into derivative transactions in due course. The transactions are not linked to specific Company assets or liabilities in the balance or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. They are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as derivative assets and derivative liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in capital market product revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Income Taxes  - The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax return. The provision for income taxes is based on income reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, rather than amounts reported on our income tax return.    ALIGN="justify"> Deferred income taxes are provided for all significant items of income and expense that are recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes and income tax reporting purposes. The asset and liability approach is used for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. This approach requires us to take into account changes in the tax rates when valuing deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. We recognize a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences. Temporary differences include differences between financial statement income and tax return income which are expected to reverse in future periods, as well as differences between tax bases of assets and liabilities and their amounts for financial reporting purposes which are also expected to be settled in future periods. To the extent a deferred tax asset is established which is not more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance will be established against such asset.    ALIGN="justify"> We periodically review and evaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for tax benefits that may not be realized. The amount of any such reserves are based on the standards for determining such reserves as set forth in current accounting guidance and our estimates of amounts that may ultimately be due or owed, including interest.    SIZE="1">     78          Net Earnings Per Common Share (EPS)  - Net earnings per common share is based on net earnings applicable to common stockholders which is net of the preferred stock dividend. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The basic EPS computation excludes the dilutive effect of all common stock equivalents. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potential common shares. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Our potential common shares represent shares issuable under its various incentive compensation plans and convertible debt. Such common stock equivalents are computed based on the treasury stock method using the average market price for the period. Due to our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, diluted net earnings per common share for those years excludes common stock equivalents because the effect is anti-dilutive.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Treasury Stock  - Treasury stock acquired is recorded at cost and is carried as a reduction of stockholders equity in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Share-Based Compensation  - Share-based compensation cost is recognized as expense for stock options and restricted stock awards issued to employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A binomial option-pricing model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the closing market price of the Companys common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. The costs are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally defined as the vesting period for the awards. When an award is granted to an employee who is retirement eligible, the compensation cost of these awards is recognized over the period up to the date an employee first become eligible to retire. The amortization of share-based compensation reflects estimated forfeitures adjusted for actual forfeiture experience. As compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time share-based awards are exercised, cancelled, expire, or restrictions are released, we may be required to recognize an adjustment to tax expense, depending on the market price of the Companys stock at that time. Share-based compensation expense is included in salaries and wages in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    For additional details on our share-based compensation plans, refer to Note 16, Share-Based Compensation and Other Benefits.    Comprehensive Income  - Comprehensive income consist of two components, reported net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. GAAP are recorded as an element of stockholders equity but are excluded from reported net income. We include changes in unrealized gains or losses on securities available-for-sale, net of tax, in other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity.   Preferred Stock  - Preferred stock ranks senior to common stock with respect to dividends and has preference in the event of liquidation. The shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock) issued to the United States Treasury (U.S. Treasury) under the TARP Capital Purchase Program (CPP) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the warrants issued under the CPP are accounted for as permanent equity on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The proceeds received were allocated between the Series B Preferred Stock and the warrants based upon their relative fair values as of the date of issuance which resulted in the recording of a discount on the Series B Preferred Stock upon issuance that reflects the value allocated to the warrants. The discount is accreted by a charge to retained earnings using the effective interest method over the expected life of the preferred stock of five years.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Series B Preferred Stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of five percent per annum until the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance, and thereafter at a rate of nine percent per annum. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears and accrued as earned over the period the Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding. Preferred dividends paid (declared and accrued) and the related accretion is deducted from net income for computing income available to common stockholders and earnings per share computations.    Segment Disclosures  - Operating segments are components of a business that (i) engage in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses; (ii) has operating results that are reviewed regularly by the entitys chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the operations of the Company under three operating segments, Banking, PrivateWealth and Holding Company Activities. Refer to Note 21 Operating Segments for additional disclosure regarding the performance of our operating segments.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">      79           2.    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    Noncontrolling Interests  - - Effective January 1, 2009 we adopted new guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB which changes the accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. This also required expanded disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of an entity. The Companys sole noncontrolling interest relates to its 75.35% interest in Lodestar Investment Counsel, LLC (Lodestar). The retrospective adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.    ALIGN="justify"> Business Combinations  - Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted new guidance the FASB issued which establishes principles and requirements for the acquirer in a business combination, including: (a) the acquisition date will be the date the acquirer obtains control; (b) all (and only) identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree will be stated at fair value on the acquisition date; (c) assets or liabilities arising from noncontractual contingencies will be measured at their acquisition date fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or liability on the acquisition date; (d) adjustments subsequently made to the provisional amounts recorded on the acquisition date will be made retroactively during a measurement period not to exceed one year; (e) acquisition-related restructuring costs will be expensed rather than included in the cost of the acquisition; (f) transaction costs will be expensed as incurred, except for debt or equity issuance costs which will be accounted for in accordance with other generally accepted accounting principles; (g) reversals of deferred income tax valuation allowances and income tax contingencies will be recognized in earnings subsequent to the measurement period; and (h) the allowance for loan losses of an acquiree will not be permitted to be recognized by the acquirer, rather, credit-related factors are now incorporated directly into the fair value of loans. In addition, this guidance requires new and modified disclosures surrounding subsequent changes to acquisition-related contingencies, contingent consideration, noncontrolling interests, acquisition-related transaction costs, fair values and cash flows not expected to be collected for acquired loans, and an enhanced goodwill roll-forward.   We apply this guidance to all business combinations completed on or after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Convertible Debt Instruments  - Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted new guidance issued by the FASB which clarifies that certain convertible debt instruments should be separately accounted for as liability and equity components. The guidance requires the issuer of certain convertible securities that may be settled partially in cash on conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. This guidance applies to our contingent convertible senior notes (which were redeemed during the first and second quarters of 2009) discussed in Note 9, Short-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements and required retroactive application for our 2007 and 2008 financial statements. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.    Participating Securities  - Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted new guidance issued by the FASB which clarifies that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. We grant restricted stock and RSUs under our stock-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method excludes from earnings per common share calculations any dividends paid or owed to participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities. All previously reported earnings per share data has been retrospectively adjusted to conform with the provisions of this guidance. Our adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on either our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.         80          The following table presents the impact of accounting standards adopted during the first quarter 2009.

The adjustment to income (loss) before income taxes and net income (loss) was $363,000 and $309,000 for December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008, respectively.     (2)    Includes $(0.01) adjustment to reflect adoption of accounting guidance related to participating securities.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Fair Value Measurements  - In April 2009, the FASB issued new guidance which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. This guidance identifies several factors that a reporting entity should evaluate to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability. If the reporting entity concludes there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity, transactions or quoted prices may not be determinative of fair value (for example, there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly), further analysis of the transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value. This also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position.    Other-Than-Temporary Impairment  - In April 2009, the FASB issued new guidance which modified existing OTTI guidance for debt securities, modified the intent and ability indicator for recognizing OTTI, and changed the trigger used to assess the collectability of cash flows from probable that the investor will be unable to collect all amounts due to the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. This guidance changed the total amount recognized in earnings when there are credit losses associated with an impaired debt security and management asserts that it does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. In those situations, impairment shall        81           be separated into (a) the amount representing a credit loss and (b) the amount related to non-credit factors. The amount of impairment related to credit losses shall be recognized in earnings. The credit loss component of an OTTI, representing an increase in credit risk, shall be determined by the reporting entity using its best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security. The amount of impairment related to non-credit factors shall be recognized in other comprehensive income. The previous cost basis less impairment recognized in earnings becomes the new cost basis of the security and shall not be adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. However, the cost basis shall be adjusted for accretion of the difference between the new cost basis and the present value of cash flows expected to be collected (portion of impairment in other comprehensive income). The total OTTI is presented in the consolidated statements of income with a reduction for the amount of the OTTI that is recognized in other comprehensive income, if any.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">This guidance requires that the cumulative effect of initial adoption be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income. The amortized cost basis of a security for which an OTTI was previously recognized shall be adjusted by the amount of the cumulative effect adjustment before taxes. The difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected shall be accreted as interest income.    This guidance expands the disclosure requirements for interim and annual periods to provide more detail on the types of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities held by major security type, including information about investment in unrealized loss position for which OTTI has or has not been recognized. In addition, disclosure is required for the reasons why an OTTI was recognized in earnings and the method and inputs used to calculate the portion of the impairment (or credit loss) recognized in earnings. The new guidance also expands disclosures by requiring entities to disclose its inputs and valuation assumptions for both interim and annual periods. In addition, disclosures are to be presented by major security type (such as commercial mortgage-backed securities or collateralized debt obligations), rather than disclosure by major category (such as trading securities and available-for-sale securities). The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position.    Fair Value Disclosures  - Effective April 1, 2009, we adopted new guidance the FASB issued which enhances consistency in financial reporting about fair value of financial instruments by increasing the frequency of such disclosures for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Subsequent Events  - Effective April 1, 2009, we adopted new guidance the FASB issued which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. In particular, this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. This guidance also sets forth the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations and liquidity.    Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption    Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets  - In June 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the transfer of financial assets. This guidance removes the exception for qualifying special-purpose entities from consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sale accounting for certain guaranteed mortgage securitizations when a transferor had not surrendered control over the transferred financial assets. The new guidance also establishes conditions for accounting and reporting of a transfer of a portion of a financial asset, modifies the asset sale/derecognition criteria, and changes how retained interests are initially measured. The new guidance is expected to provide greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, with the transferred assets. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position.    Variable Interest Entities  - In June 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to variable interest entities. This guidance replaces a quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb its losses or the right to receive its benefits. This guidance requires reconsideration of whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts or circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. It also requires ongoing assessments of whether a variable interest holder is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on our financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position.         82          In January 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard providing additional guidance relating to fair value measurement disclosures. Specifically, companies will be required to separately disclose significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers. Significance should generally be based on earnings and total assets or liabilities, or when changes are recognized in other comprehensive income, based on total equity. Companies may take different approaches in determining when to recognize such transfers, including using the actual date of the event or change in circumstances causing the transfer, or using the beginning or ending of a reporting period. For Level 3 fair value measurements, the new guidance requires presentation of separate information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements. Additionally, the FASB also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure requirements relating to the level of disaggregation, inputs, and valuation techniques. This accounting standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010, except for the detailed Level 3 disclosures, which will be effective beginning January 1, 2011. The adoption of the applicable provisions of the standard on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity position as the standard addresses financial statement disclosures only.        3.    FDIC-ASSISTED ACQUISITION    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On July 2, 2009, The PrivateBank - Chicago, acquired certain assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits of the former Founders Bank (Founders) from the FDIC. The transaction consisted of approximately $843 million in assets, including $181 million in investments and $592 million in loans. The PrivateBank - Chicago assumed $791 million in liabilities including $767 million in non-brokered deposits and $24 million in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Assets totaling approximately $843 million were purchased at a discount of $54 million. The PrivateBank - Chicago and the FDIC entered into a loss sharing agreement regarding future losses incurred on loans and foreclosed loan collateral existing at July 2, 2009. Under the terms of the loss-sharing agreements, the FDIC generally will assume 80% of the first $173 million of credit losses and 95% of the credit losses in excess of $173 million.    As a result of the loss sharing agreement discussed above, the acquired loans and foreclosed loan collateral (including the fair value of expected reimbursements from the FDIC) is presented in our Consolidated Statement of Condition as covered assets. In accordance with business combination accounting rules, these loans were recorded at fair value without a corresponding allowance for loan losses.    Purchased loans acquired in a business combination, including loans purchased in the Founders transaction, are accounted for under specialized accounting rules when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that not all contractual payments will be collected (purchased impaired loans). Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and non-accrual status, declines in current borrower FICO scores, geographic concentration and declines in current loan-to-value ratios. U.S. GAAP requires these loans to be recorded at fair value at acquisition date and prohibits the carrying over or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting for loans acquired in a transfer such as those loans we acquired in the Founders transaction.    The following table presents the carrying amount of the covered assets at December 31, 2009 and consists of loans subject to the specialized accounting rules related to purchased impaired loans, loans not subject to those rules and other assets.    STYLE="margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"> Covered Assets    SIZE="2">(Amounts in thousands)                               Purchased Impaired Loans      Other Loans      Other Assets      Total           Commercial loans      $  13,390      $  65,495      $          $  78,885     Commercial real estate loans         78,378         147,746                    226,124     Residential mortgage loans         289         59,858                    60,147     Consumer installment and other         2,083         10,847         508         13,438     Foreclosed real estate                               14,770         14,770     Asset in lieu                     560         560     Estimated loss reimbursement by the FDIC                               108,110         108,110                                               Total gross covered assets      $  94,140      $  283,946      $  123,948      $  502,034                                                  83          As of the date of acquisition, the preliminary estimate of the contractually required payments receivable for all purchased impaired loans acquired in the Founders transaction were $236.2 million, the cash flows expected to be collected were $133.9 million including interest, and the estimated fair value of the loans were $102.2 million. The fair values for loans within the scope of the specialized accounting rules are determined by discounting both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value. We estimate the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition using internal models that incorporate managements best estimate of current key assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and payment speeds. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their preliminary estimated fair values. Because of the estimation process required, certain refinements may be made to finalize these carrying values upon completion of the analysis of the fair values of assets and liabilities.    Under the specialized accounting rules, any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method when there is a reasonable expectation about amount and timing of such cash flows. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for covered asset losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for total covered asset losses to the extent of prior charges or a reclassification of the difference from non-accretable to accretable with a positive impact on interest income.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During fourth quarter 2009, a $2.8 million allowance for covered asset losses was established related to the purchased impaired loans and was based on an in-depth analysis of the loans at a pool level.

These equity securities are restricted in that they can only be sold back to the respective institutions or another member institution at par. Therefore, they are less liquid than other tradable equity securities. Their fair value is equal to amortized cost, and no other-than-temporary impairments have been recorded on these securities during 2009, 2008, or 2007.

The unrealized losses reported for collateralized mortgage obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities were caused by increases in interest rates and the contractual cash flows of those investments are primarily guaranteed by either U.S. Government agencies or by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises. Accordingly, we believe the credit risk embedded in these securities to be inherently low. The unrealized losses in our investments in state and municipal securities are due to increases in interest rates and the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities.    Since the declines in fair value on our securities are attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2009, we were obligated under certain non-cancelable operating leases for premises and equipment, which expire at various dates through the year 2023. Many of these leases contain renewal options, and certain leases provide options to purchase the leased property during or at the expiration of the lease period at specific prices. Some leases contain escalation clauses calling for rentals to be adjusted for increased real estate taxes and other operating expenses, or proportionately adjusted for increases in the consumer or other price indices. The following summary reflects the future minimum rental payments, by year, required under operating leases that, as of December 31, 2009, have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year.

Consistent with prior years, the Company has elected to conduct its annual impairment testing as of October 31, 2009. Due to changes in the business climate and the resulting decline in financial services stock prices, during 2009, management also completed an interim review of goodwill in the first quarter. These interim reviews of goodwill indicated that the carrying value (including goodwill) of the Banking segment exceeded its estimated fair value. Therefore, a step two analysis was performed for this segment, which indicated that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the Banking segment exceeded the carrying value (including goodwill). Therefore, no impairment charge was recorded. There were no impairment charges recorded in 2009, 2008, or 2007. However, market valuations of financial services companies remain depressed relative to book values due to continuing uncertainty. As a result, management believes it may be necessary to continue to evaluate goodwill for impairment on a more frequent basis depending upon current market conditions, results of operations, and other factors. It is possible that a future conclusion could be reached that all or a portion of the Companys goodwill may be impaired, in which case a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded in earnings. Such a charge, if any, would have no impact on tangible capital and would not affect the Companys well-capitalized designation.   Goodwill decreased by $374,000 during 2009 due to an adjustment for tax benefits associated with the goodwill attributable to Lodestar Investment Counsel, LLC (Lodestar), an investment management firm and subsidiary of the Company. In June 2008, we recorded a $1.7 million increase to goodwill in the PrivateWealth operating segment associated with the 2002 acquisition of an 80% interest in Lodestar. At the time of acquisition, we did not properly reflect the value of certain contractual put rights related to the minority interest owned by the principals of Lodestar resulting in an understatement of goodwill. This accounting correction was made in accordance with current accounting guidance.    We have other intangible assets capitalized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition in the form of core deposit premiums, client relationships and assembled workforce. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 years to 15 years. We review intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

Repurchase agreements are secured by U.S. Treasury, mortgage-backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations and, if required, are held in third party pledge accounts. During the second quarter 2009, we redeemed a $97.0 million repurchase agreement in connection with the sale of the related collateral, incurring a $1.0 million early extinguishment of debt charge. The securities underlying the agreements remain in the respective asset accounts.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES HELD BY TRUSTS THAT ISSUED GUARANTEED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES   As of December 31, 2009, we sponsored and wholly owned 100% of the common equity of four trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities (Trust Preferred Securities) to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities solely in junior subordinated debt securities of the Company (the Debentures). The Debentures held by the trusts, which totaled $244.8 million, are the sole assets of each trust. Our obligations under the Debentures and related documents, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of the trusts. The guarantee covers the distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of the Trust Preferred Securities, but only to the extent of funds held by the trusts. We have the right to redeem the Debentures in whole or in part, on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. We used the proceeds from the sales of the Debentures for general corporate purposes.    Under current accounting rules, the trusts qualify as variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore ineligible for consolidation. Accordingly, the trusts are not consolidated in our financial statements.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY    SIZE="2"> TARP Capital Purchase Program    In January 2009, we issued 243,815 shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock) to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 for proceeds of $243.8 million. Cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are payable at five percent per annum for the first five years and at a rate of nine percent per annum thereafter on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. We are prohibited from paying any dividend with respect to shares of our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid in full on the Series B Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods. The Series B Preferred Stock is non-voting, other than class voting rights on matters that could adversely affect the Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is callable at par after three years. Prior to the end of three years, the Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed with the proceeds from one or more qualified equity offerings of any Tier 1 perpetual preferred or common stock of at least $61.0 million (each a Qualified Equity Offering). The redemption price is equal to the sum of the liquidation amount per share and any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series B preferred Stock. The U.S. Treasury may also transfer the Series B Preferred Stock to a third party at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) requires the U.S. Treasury, subject to consultation with appropriate banking regulators, to permit participants in the CPP to redeem preferred stock issued under the CPP without regard to whether the recipient has completed a Qualified Equity Offering or replaced such funds from any other source, or to any waiting period.    In conjunction with the purchase of the Companys Series B Preferred Stock, the U.S. Treasury received a ten year warrant to purchase up to 1,290,026 shares of the Companys common stock (subject to adjustment as described in the following paragraph) with an aggregate market price equal to $36.6 million or 15% of the Series B Preferred Stock. The warrants exercise price of $28.35 per share was calculated based on the average closing price of the Companys common stock on the 20 trading days ending on the last trading day prior to the date of the U.S. Treasurys approval of our application under the CPP. The U.S. Treasury may not exercise or transfer the warrants with respect to more than half of the initial shares of common stock underlying the warrants prior to the earlier of (a) the date on which we receive aggregate gross proceeds of not less than $243.8 million from one or more Qualified Equity Offerings and (b) December 31, 2009. The ARRA provides that the U.S. Treasury may liquidate these warrants if we fully redeem the Series B Preferred Stock either as a result of redemption by us at a market price determined under the warrants or sale by the U.S. Treasury to third party.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> The terms of the warrant provided that the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrant would be reduced by 50% in the event that we received aggregate gross proceeds of at least $243.8 million from one or more Qualified Equity Offerings prior to December 31, 2009. In December 2009, as a result of the completion of two Qualified Equity Offerings during 2009 pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds in excess of $243.8 million, we received confirmation from representatives of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant was reduced by 50 percent from 1,290,026 to 645,013 shares.    The Series B Preferred Stock and the warrants issued under the CPP are accounted for as permanent equity on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The proceeds received were allocated between the Series B Preferred Stock and the warrants based upon their relative fair values as of January 30, 2009, the date of issuance, which resulted in the recording of a discount on the Series B Preferred Stock upon issuance that reflects the value allocated to the warrants. The discount is accreted by a charge to retained earnings using the effective interest method over five years and reported as a reduction of income applicable to common equity over that period. The allocated carrying value of the Series B Preferred Stock and warrants on the date of issuance (based on their relative fair values) were $236.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively. The Series B Preferred Stock and warrants qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Under the terms of our agreements with the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the CPP, we may increase quarterly common stock dividends at any time, but are precluded from raising the quarterly dividend above $0.075 per share prior to January 30, 2012, the date that is three years following the sale of the Series B Preferred Stock to the U. S. Treasury. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the FRB regarding capital adequacy and dividends and we are required to consult with the FRB before declaring or paying any dividends. Dividends also may be limited as a result of safety and soundness considerations. Refer to the section entitled Supervision and Regulation in this Form 10-K for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Our quarterly common stock dividend for each of the four quarters of 2009 was $0.01 per share.         95          Issuance of Common Stock    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The following table presents a summary of the Companys common stock offerings during 2009.

In 2008 we completed a public offering of approximately 4.6 million shares of newly issued common stock at a public offering price of $34.00 per share, for net proceeds of $149.1 million after deducting underwriting commissions and included underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option of an additional 568,700 shares.

GTCR purchased 522.963 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, which is convertible into 522,963 common shares and has no voting rights. In June 2009, GTCR converted all of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock that it owned into shares of our non-voting common stock pursuant to its terms as more fully described below.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In June 2009, we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (1) create a new class of non-voting common stock (the Non-voting Common Stock), and (2) amend and restate the Certificate of Designations of the Companys Series A Junior Non-voting Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) to provide, among other things, that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible only into shares of Non-voting Common Stock. Under the amended terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of Non-voting Common Stock. We issued 1,951,037 shares of Non-voting Common Stock to GTCR upon notice of conversion by GTCR of all of its 1,951.037 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock held and converted by GTCR represented all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock on such date. We also entered into an amendment to our existing Preemptive and Registration Rights Agreement with GTCR pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the newly issued shares of Non-voting Common Stock for resale under the Securities Act of 1933.         96          Comprehensive Income    ALIGN="justify"> Comprehensive income includes net income as well as certain items that are reported directly within a separate component of stockholders equity that are not considered part of net income.

Realization of Deferred Tax Assets   Net deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.   As a result of the pre-tax losses incurred during 2008 and 2009, we are in a cumulative pre-tax loss position for financial statement purposes for the three-year period ended December 31, 2009. Under current accounting guidance ,  this represents significant negative evidence in the assessment of whether the deferred tax assets will be realized. However, we have concluded that based on the weight given to other positive evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In making this determination, we have considered the positive evidence associated with taxable income generated in 2009 and reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods. Most significantly, however, we have relied on our ability to generate future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences, over a relatively short time period.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009 represent the aggregate of federal and state tax assets, although federal taxes represent the primary component of the balance. Future federal taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences, of approximately $191 million is necessary in order to fully absorb the federal deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009.    ALIGN="justify"> The Company recorded a pre-tax loss for financial statement purposes in 2009. Various book-tax differences result in the Company being in a positive taxable income position for 2009. In assessing our prospects for generating future pre-tax book income, we considered a number of factors, including: (a) our success in achieving strong and growing operating income (pre-tax, pre-provision)        100           results during 2009; (b) the concentration of credit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio; and (c) our significant excess tangible capital position relative to well capitalized regulatory standards and other industry benchmarks. These factors support our expectation of higher pre-tax earnings in future periods. We believe this in turn should give rise to taxable income levels (exclusive of reversing temporary differences) that more likely than not would be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets over a short time period.    SIZE="2"> Liabilities Associated with Unrecognized Tax Benefits    We file a U.S. federal income tax return and state income tax returns in various states. We are no longer subject to examinations by U.S. federal tax authorities for 2006 and prior years. We are also no longer subject to examinations by certain state departments of revenue for 2004 and prior years.    The Company adopted the provisions of the FASB pronouncement on Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes on January 1, 2007. Prior to 2009, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and accordingly no amounts were recognized and accrued for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:    SIZE="2"> Roll Forward of Unrecognized Tax Benefits    (Amounts in thousands)    STYLE="font-size:12px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">                  2009     Balance at beginning of year      $         Additions for tax positions related to prior years         876                 Balance at end of year      $  876               The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized in future periods, was $667,000. While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months, the Company does not anticipate this change to have a material impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.    The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognized interest and penalties, net of tax effect, of $68,000 in 2009 relating to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company had accrued interest and penalties, net of tax effect, of $68,000 at December 31, 2009. This amount is not included in the unrecognized tax benefits roll forward presented above.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER BENEFITS    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Share-Based Plans    2007 Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan)  - In 2007, the Board of Directors with subsequent approval of our stockholders, approved the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan allows for the issuance of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, equity-based performance stock and units and other cash and stock-based incentives to employees, including officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. The total number of shares of our common stock authorized for awards under the 2007 Plan is 5,000,000 (of which 1,500,000 shares may be granted in restricted stock or units.) As of December 31, 2009, 3,239,538 shares remain available for grant.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> At December 31, 2009, the 2007 Plan remains the Companys only active share-based compensation plan. The Company has three inactive plans for which no shares remain available for grant and in accordance with the plan provisions, effective December 31, 2009, includes the Strategic Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan which was established in 2007 as part of the Companys Strategic Growth Plan that provided for the granting of inducement equity awards as a means to attract talent and to promote the achievement of exceptional performance benchmarks. Although no new awards will be granted under the predecessor plans, all have unvested or unexercised awards outstanding at December 31, 2009.    All stock awards granted under the plans have an exercise price that is established at the closing price of our common stock on the date the awards were granted.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Stock options are issued to certain key employees and non-employee directors. Options vest generally from 1 to 5 years based on continuous service. We have issued both incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. All options have a 10-year term.         101          We may issue common stock with restrictions to certain key employees and non-employee directors. The shares are restricted as to transfer, but are not restricted as to voting rights and generally receive similar dividend payments. The transfer restrictions lapse from 1 to 5 years and are contingent upon continued employment. We also issue restricted stock units which settle in common stock when restrictions lapse. These units are issued on similar terms as restricted common stock but these instruments have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents rather than dividends.

Savings and Retirement Plan    ALIGN="justify"> The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan, The PrivateBancorp, Inc.

At the employees direction, employee contributions are invested among a variety of investment alternatives. For employees who have met a one-year service requirement and make voluntary contributions to the KSOP, we contribute an amount equal to $0.50 for each dollar        104           contributed up to a 6% annual indexed maximum of employees compensation. The KSOP also allows for a discretionary company contribution. The companys matching contribution vests in increments of 20% annually for each year in which 1,000 hours are worked. The discretionary component vests in increments of 20% annually over a period of 5 years based on the employees years of service.

The purpose of the Plan is to further our ability to attract and retain high quality executives and non-employee directors. Executive officers who participate in the Plan may elect to defer up to 50% of annual base salary and 100% of annual bonus amounts and directors may elect to defer up to 100% of annual directors fees. While deferred, amounts are credited with earnings as if they were invested in either a fixed income account with interest credited based on our prime rate (not to exceed 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate on the cash value of the funds deposited), or in deferred stock units (DSUs), as the participant may elect at the time the amounts are deferred. Except for an earnings credit on the deferred amounts, we do not provide any contributions or credits to participants under the Plan. At December 31, 2009 there were 54,381 DSUs and 28,749 at December 31, 2008 recorded in the Plan. At the time of distribution amounts credited in DSUs are paid in shares of our stock while amounts credited in the fixed income option are paid in cash. All elections and payments under the Plan are subject to compliance with requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code which may limit elections and require delay in payment of benefits in certain circumstances.

REGULATORY AND CAPITAL MATTERS    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company and our banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory requirements that impose restrictions on cash, loans or advances, and dividends. The Banks are required to maintain reserves against deposits. Reserves are held either in the form of vault cash or non-interest-bearing balances maintained with the FRB and are based on the average daily balances and statutory reserve ratios prescribed by the type of deposit account. Reserve balances totaling $19.8 million at December 31, 2009 and $8.5 million at December 31, 2008 were maintained in fulfillment of these requirements. In addition, the Company $22.0 million in cash and due from banks which was held as collateral for its standby letter of credit services.    Under current FRB regulations, the Banks are limited in the amount they may loan or advance to the Parent Company and its nonbank subsidiaries. Loans or advances to a single subsidiary may not exceed 10% and loans to all subsidiaries may not exceed 20% of the banks capital stock and surplus, as defined. Loans from subsidiary banks to nonbank subsidiaries, including the Parent Company, are also required to be collateralized.    The principal source of cash flow for the Company is dividends from the Banks. Various federal and state banking regulations and capital guidelines limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the Company by the Banks. Future payment of dividends by the Banks is dependent upon individual regulatory capital requirements and levels of profitability. As of December 31, 2009, without prior regulatory approval, the Banks can initiate aggregate dividend payments in $42.0 million.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> The Company and the Banks are also subject to various capital requirements set up and administered by the federal banking agencies. Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Banks must meet specific guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators regarding components of capital and assets, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (as defined). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could initiate certain mandatory, and possible additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, the Company and the Banks meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.         105          The Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve), the primary regulator of the Company and the Banks, establishes minimum capital requirements that must be met by member institutions. As of December 31, 2009, the most recent regulatory notification classified the Banks as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes would change the Banks classification.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are an end-user of certain derivative financial instruments which we use to manage our exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We also use these instruments for client accommodation as we make a market in derivatives for our clients.    None of the end-user and client related derivatives have been designated as hedging instruments. Both end-user and client related derivatives are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as either derivative assets or derivative        106           liabilities, with changes in their fair value recorded in current earnings. Refer to Table A for the fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross basis as of December 31, 2009, and where they are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Table B for the related net gains/(losses) recognized during the year ended December 31, 2009, and where they are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income.    Derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements as allowed under authoritative accounting guidance.    SIZE="2">Derivatives expose us to credit risk measured as replacement cost (current positive mark to market value plus potential future exposure from positive movements in mark to market). Credit risk is managed through the banks standard underwriting process. Actual exposures are monitored against various types of credit limits established to contain risk within parameters. Additionally, credit risk is managed through the use of collateral and netting agreements.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> End-User Derivatives  - We enter into derivatives that include commitments to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans. It is our practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of fixed rate residential mortgage loans when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates on our commitments to fund the loans as well as on our portfolio of mortgage loans held-for-sale. At December 31, 2009, we had approximately $35.4 million of interest rate lock commitments and $63.8 million of forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans with rate locks.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are also exposed at times to foreign exchange risk as a result of issuing loans in which the principal and interest are settled in a currency other than US dollars. Currently our exposure is to the British pound and we manage this risk by using currency forward derivatives.    Client Related Derivatives  - We offer, through our capital markets group, an extensive range of over-the-counter interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to our clients including but not limited to interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, interest rate options (also referred to as Caps, Floors, Collars, etc.), foreign exchange forwards and options as well as cash products such as foreign exchange spot transactions. These client generated activities are structured to mitigate our exposure to market risk through the execution of off-setting positions with inter-bank dealer counterparties. This permits the capital markets group to offer customized risk management solutions to our clients while maintaining high capital velocity. Although transactions originated by capital markets do not expose us to overnight market risk, they do expose us to other risks including counterparty credit, settlement, and operational risk.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">To accommodate our loan clients, we occasionally enter into risk participation agreements (RPAs) with counterparty banks to either accept or transfer a portion of the credit risk related to their interest rate derivatives. This allows clients to execute an interest rate derivative with one bank while allowing for distribution of the credit risk between participating members. We have entered into written RPAs in which the bank accepts a portion of the credit risk associated with a loan clients interest rate derivative in exchange for a fee. At December 31, 2009, written RPAs had remaining terms to maturity ranging from one-to-four years. The bank manages this credit risk through its loan underwriting process and when appropriate the RPA is backed by collateral provided by our clients under their loan agreement.    SIZE="2">The current payment/performance risk of written RPAs is assessed using internal risk ratings which range from 1 to 8 with the latter representing the highest credit risk. The risk rating is based on several factors including the financial condition of the RPAs underlying derivative counterparty, present economic conditions, performance trends, leverage, and liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, written RPAs were assigned a risk rating of between 3 and 7.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> The maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments that we could be required to make under our written risk participation agreements is approximately $4.9 million. This assumes that the underlying derivative counterparty defaults and that the floating interest rate index of the underlying derivative remains at zero percent. In the event that we would have to pay out any amounts under our RPAs, we will seek to recover these from assets that our clients pledged as collateral for the derivative and the related loan. We believe that proceeds from the liquidation of the collateral will cover approximately 61% of the maximum potential amount of future payments under our outstanding RPAs. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of written RPAs totaled ($101,100).         107          Table A    ALIGN="center"> Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition Location of and Fair Value of Derivative Instruments    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(Amounts in thousands)                                 As of December 31, 2009             Assets Derivatives        Liability Derivatives             Notional/Contract Amount  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(1)      Fair Value        Notional/Contract Amount  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(1)      Fair Value        Capital market group derivatives  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(2) :                              Interest rate contracts      $  2,759,586      $  75,728         $  2,759,586      $  76,475         Foreign exchange contracts         127,067         3,803            127,067         3,374         Credit contracts         4,629         1            81,537         101                                                Total fair value capital markets group derivatives               79,532                  79,950         Netting adjustments  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(3)               (7,992  )               (7,992  )                                             Total capital markets group derivatives            $  71,540               $  71,958                                                Other derivatives  STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">(4) :                              Foreign exchange derivatives         3,439      $  96               $             Mortgage banking derivatives               557                  445                                                Total other derivatives               653                  445                                                Total derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship            $  72,193               $  72,403                                                      (1) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    The weighted average notional amounts are shown for credit contracts.        (2) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    Capital market group asset and liability derivatives are reported as Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition, respectively.        (3) STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">    Represents netting of derivative asset and liability balances, and related cash collateral, with the same counterparty subject to master netting agreements.

These contingent features are triggered if we do not meet specified financial performance indicators such as capital or credit ratios.    The aggregate fair value of all derivatives and RPA transactions subject to credit risk contingency features that are in a net liability position on December 31, 2009, totaled $50.2 million for which we have posted collateral of $56.4 million in the normal course of business. If the credit risk contingency features were triggered on December 31, 2009, we would be required to post an additional $1.0 million of collateral to our derivative counterparties and immediately settle outstanding derivative instruments for $33.9 million, not taking into account posted collateral.         19.    COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Credit Extension Commitments and Guarantees    In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers, to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, and to conduct lending activities. These instruments principally include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.    Contractual or Notional Amounts of Financial Instruments    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"> (Amounts in thousands)                         December 31,          2009      2008         Commitments to extend credit:                 Home equity lines      $  186,618      $  149,845     All other commitments         3,600,335         2,950,498     Letters of credit:                 Standby         232,681         201,767     Commercial         1,085         9,697   Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and variable interest rates tied to the prime rate or LIBOR and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash-flow requirements.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the client to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party and are most often issued in favor of a municipality where construction is taking place to        110           ensure the borrower adequately completes the construction. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the client and the third party. This type of letter of credit is issued through a correspondent bank on behalf of a client who is involved in an international business activity such as the importing of goods.    In the event of a clients nonperformance, our credit loss exposure is equal to the contractual amount of those commitments. The credit risk is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and is subject to our normal credit policies. We use the same credit policies in making credit commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments, with such exposure to credit loss minimized due to various collateral requirements in place. In the event of nonperformance by the clients, we have rights to the underlying collateral, which could include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities.    The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under standby letters of credit arrangements are equal to the contractual amount of the commitment. The unamortized fees associated with standby letters of credit, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, totaled $562,000 as of December 31, 2009. We amortize these amounts into income over the commitment period. As of December 31, 2009, standby letters of credit had a remaining weighted-average term of approximately 14 months, with remaining actual lives ranging from less than 1 year to 8 years.    Legal Proceedings    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> As of December 31, 2009, there were certain legal proceedings pending against us and our subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, arising from these proceedings, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition as of December 31, 2009.    STYLE="font-size:18px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">     20.    ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We measure, monitor, and disclose certain of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis to account for securities available-for-sale, derivative assets, and derivative liabilities. In addition, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to apply lower-of-cost-or-market accounting to foreclosed real estate; evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment, including collateral-dependent impaired loans and for disclosure purposes. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, we use various valuation techniques and input assumptions when estimating fair value.    U.S. GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels based on the reliability of the input assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:    STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">               Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.    STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">               Level 2  Observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.    STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">               Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.    The categorization of where an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.    Valuation Methodology    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. However, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value. Additionally, the methods used may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.         111          The following describes the valuation methodologies we use for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, including the general classification of the assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.    SIZE="2"> Securities Available-for-Sale  - Securities available-for-sale includes U.S. Treasury, collateralized mortgage obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities, corporate collateralized mortgage obligations and state and municipal securities. Substantially all available-for-sale securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but may be traded in active markets. The fair value of these securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from external pricing services or dealer market participants where trading in an active market exists. In obtaining such data from external pricing services, we have evaluated the methodologies used to develop the fair values in order to determine whether such valuations are representative of an exit price in our principal markets. The principal markets for our securities portfolio are the secondary institutional markets, with an exit price that is predominantly reflective of bid level pricing in those markets. U.S. Treasury securities have been classified in level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Virtually all other remaining securities are classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans  - The carrying value of impaired loans is disclosed in Note 5, Loans. We do not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, fair value adjustments are recorded on these loans to reflect (1) partial write-downs that are based on the current appraised or market-quoted value of the underlying collateral or (2) the full charge-off of the loan carrying value. In some cases, the properties for which market quotes or appraised values have been obtained are located in areas where comparable sales data is limited, outdated, or unavailable. Accordingly, fair value estimates, including those obtained from real estate brokers or other third-party consultants, for collateral-dependent impaired loans are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="justify"> Other Real Estate Owned (OREO)  -  OREO is valued based on third-party appraisals of each property and our judgment of other relevant market conditions and are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.    Covered Assets-Foreclosed Real Estate  - Covered assets-foreclosed real estate is valued based on third-party appraisals of each property and our judgment of other relevant market conditions and are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.   Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities  - Client related derivative instruments with positive fair values are reported as an asset and derivative instruments with negative fair value are reported as liabilities and after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. The fair value of client related derivative assets and liabilities are determined based on the fair market value as quoted by broker-dealers using standardized industry models, third party advisors using standardized industry models, or internally generated models based primarily on observable inputs. Client related derivative assets and liabilities are generally classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.    Other Assets and Other Liabilities  - Included in Other Assets and Other Liabilities are end-user derivative instruments that we use to manage our foreign exchange and interest rate risk. End-user derivative instruments with positive fair value are reported as an asset and end-user derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported as liabilities and after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. The fair value of end-user derivative assets and liabilities are determined based on the fair market value as quoted by broker-dealers using standardized industry models, third party advisors using standardized industry models, or internally generated models based primarily on observable inputs. End-user derivative assets and liabilities are classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.         112          Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value    ALIGN="justify"> The following table provides the hierarchy level and fair value for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

SIZE="2">U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair values of certain financial instruments, both assets and liabilities, on and off-balance sheet, for which it is practical to estimate the fair value. Because the estimated fair values provided herein exclude disclosure of the fair value of certain other financial instruments and all non-financial instruments, any aggregation of the estimated fair value amounts presented would not represent our underlying value. Examples of non-financial instruments having significant value include the future earnings potential of significant customer relationships and the value of The PrivateWealth Groups operations and other fee-generating businesses. In addition, other significant assets including property, plant, and equipment and goodwill are not considered financial instruments and, therefore, have not been valued.         115          Various methodologies and assumptions have been utilized in managements determination of the estimated fair value of our financial instruments, which are detailed below. The fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in time based on relevant market information. Because no market exists for a significant portion of these financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, loss experience, and risk characteristics of the financial instruments. These estimates are subjective, involve uncertainties, and cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.    The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments.    Short-term financial assets and liabilities   For financial instruments with a shorter-term or with no stated maturity, prevailing market rates, and limited credit risk, the carrying amounts approximate fair value. Those financial instruments include cash and due from banks, funds sold and other short-term investments, accrued interest receivable, and accrued interest payable.    Mortgages held for sale   The fair value of mortgages held for sale are based on quoted market rates or, in the case where a firm commitment has been made to sell the loan, the firm committed price.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Securities Available-for-Sale   The fair value of securities is based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.    Non-marketable equity investments   Non-marketable equity investments include FHLB stock and other various equity securities. The carrying value of FHLB stock approximates fair value as the stock is non-marketable, but redeemable at par value. The carrying value of all other equity investments approximates fair value.   Loans   The fair value of performing loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit, liquidity risk and interest rate risk inherent in the loan. The estimate of maturity is based on our and the industrys historical experience with repayments for each loan classification, modified, as required, by an estimate of the effect of current economic and lending conditions. Fair value of impaired loans approximates their carrying value net of specific reserves because such loans are recorded at estimated recoverable value of the collateral or the underlying cash flow.    Covered assets   Covered assets include the acquired loans and foreclosed loan collateral (including the fair value of expected reimbursements from the FDIC).    SIZE="2"> Investment in Bank Owned Life Insurance   The fair value of our investment in bank owned life insurance is equal to its cash surrender value.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Deposit liabilities   The fair values disclosed for non-interest bearing demand deposits, savings deposits, interest-bearing deposits, and money market deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The fair value for certificate of deposits and brokered deposits were estimated using present value techniques by discounting the future cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.    Short-term borrowings   The fair value of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances with the remaining maturities of one year or less is estimated by discounting the agreements based on maturities using the rates currently offered for repurchase agreements or borrowings of similar remaining maturities. The carrying amounts of funds purchased and other borrowed funds approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Long-term debt   The fair value of subordinated debt was determined using available market quotes. The fair value of FHLB advances with remaining maturities greater than one year is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments. The fair value of the junior subordinated debentures was estimated by discounting future cash flows using a yield curve based on market rate data for similar debt while considering the Companys own credit risk.    Derivative assets and liabilities   The fair value of derivative instruments are based either on cash flow projection models acquired from third parties or observable market price. The Company provides client data to the third party source for purposes of calculating the credit valuation component of the fair value measurement of client derivative contracts. The Company has also considered its own credit risk in determining derivative valuations.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Commitments   Given the limited interest rate exposure posed by the commitments outstanding at year-end due to their general variable nature, combined with the general short-term nature of the commitment periods entered into, termination clauses provided in the agreements, and the market rate of fees charged, we have estimated the fair value of commitments outstanding to be immaterial.

OPERATING SEGMENTS     STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We have three primary operating segments, Banking and The PrivateWealth Group that are delineated by the products and services that each segment offers, and the Holding Company. The Banking operating segment includes both commercial and personal banking services and The PrivateBank Mortgage Company. Commercial banking services are primarily provided to corporations and other business clients and include a wide array of lending and cash management products. Personal banking services offered to individuals, professionals, and entrepreneurs include direct lending and depository services. The PrivateWealth Group segment includes investment management, investment advisory, personal trust and estate administration, custodial and escrow, retirement account administration, and brokerage services. The activities of the third operating segment, the Holding Company, include the direct and indirect ownership of our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries and the issuance of debt.    The accounting policies of the individual operating segments are the same as those of the Company as described in Note 1. Transactions between operating segments are primarily conducted at fair value, resulting in profits that are eliminated from consolidated results of operations. Financial results for each segment are presented below.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT (Unaudited)    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In connection with the Companys year-end compensation planning and review process, effective January 28, 2010, the Compensation Committee (Committee) of the Board of Directors (Board) and the Board approved amendments to certain previously granted performance share awards to modify the vesting provisions to provide for time vesting of the awards rather than performance vesting based on certain stock price appreciation targets established in 2007. The performance shares were awarded in late-2007 and 2008 to approximately 130 employees pursuant to the Companys Strategic Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and the Companys 2007 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan in connection with the recruitment of key employees to implement the Companys transformational strategic plan. The amendments do not change the number of shares, the vesting schedule, continued service requirements or any other terms or conditions set forth in the original awards.    The amended awards are intended to provide long-term incentives that continue to drive core operating performance and to position us to create long-term shareholder value, while also creating a meaningful retention benefit. The Company has not paid bonuses to executive officers or managing directors for 2009. The amendments will be in lieu of implementing an annual equity compensation program for the participating employees for 2010. Each amendment is contingent upon the holders acknowledgment and agreement that the amendment and all other compensation arrangements are subject to compliance with executive compensation restrictions and requirements under the TARP CPP. A total of 127 employees awards were modified. The incremental cost of this modification was $9.9 million and will be recognized from 2010 through 2012. Please refer to Note 16, Share-Based Compensation for further information regarding our share-based compensation plans.    SIZE="1">     122          ITEM 9.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.    SIZE="2"> Managements Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 was effective based on the specified criteria.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. That report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, is included in this Item under the heading Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    SIZE="2"> Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    The Board of Directors and Shareholders of PrivateBancorp, Inc.    We have audited PrivateBancorp, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). PrivateBancorp, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.    STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.         123          A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.    In our opinion, PrivateBancorp, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.    We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial condition of PrivateBancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of PrivateBancorp, Inc. and our report dated March 1, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.    /S/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> Chicago, Illinois    March 1, 2010        124          ITEM 9B.
