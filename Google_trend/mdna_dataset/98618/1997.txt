ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Liquidity and Capital Resources       As of June 30, 1997, the Company's current assets exceeded current liabilities by $1,083,000 or a ratio of 1.5 to 1.  This decrease from the prior year can be attributed largely to a reduction in inventory levels of $705,000 and an increase of $766,000 in current maturities of capitalized machine leases associated with the Fry Guy food program.  Subsequent to fiscal year end, the Company secured a line of credit to provide additional working capital, if needed. Aside from lease obligations, the Company is relatively debt free.  It does not see the need for further issuance of equity securities at this time.       The Company is not anticipating any significant capital additions aside from the Fry Guy expansion, which will be funded through available leasing sources.  As revenue from the food program increases, the Company will rely less upon outside funding to fulfill its requirements.       During June 1997, the Company signed a $1,050,000 contract for the installation of pollution control equipment in China.  This sale was finalized through the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Alanco Environmental Technology Co., Ltd., which is incorporated in Beijing, China.  The contract terms require deposits and progress payments during the construction period.  Subsequent to year end, the Company received a $120,000 deposit on the above contract.  Additional contracts are anticipated during the coming year.       The Company discontinued operating its insurance adjustment business in favor of concentrating its efforts on the Fry Guy expansion and sales in the environmental equipment business segments.  The shutdown of the insurance segment will result in significant savings in operating expenses and will help reduce the Company's overall cash requirements.       The manufacturing business segment has generated internally the necessary working capital to finance its activities.  It is projecting a profit and is not budgeting any significant capital needs.  During the past fiscal year, this segment successfully developed a state of the art commercial dust filter that currently has a patent pending.  Significant sales from this product line are anticipated during the year.  Results of Operations                        Fiscal 1997 Compared to Fiscal 1996       Consolidated revenues for fiscal year 1997 increased 87% or $3,289,000 over fiscal year 1996.  Effective June 30, 1997, the insurance business segment was shut down and all prior amounts have been restated for comparative purposes.  The food service segment, Fry Guy Inc., accounted for 82% of the increase in revenue as the food program developed rapidly during 1997.  Revenue in the manufacturing segment increased by 13% during the year.  Sales of                                                19   pollution control equipment during 1997 were $155,000.  There were no pollution equipment sales in the prior year.       Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $626,000 or 18% over the prior year.  Sixty-nine percent of the increase was in the food service segment and reflects expenses associated with sales growth. The balance of the increase was in the manufacturing segment and reflects additional marketing efforts.       Consolidated Loss from Operations, before other income and expenses, was a negative $1,650,000.  This was an improvement over the prior year by $1,346,000.  This gain can be directly attributed to the success of the Fry Guy good program which was not fully implemented during 1996.       Included under other income and expenses is a $2,593,000 asset write-down of the Company's mining properties.  This represents $0.08 per share of the loss reported from continuing operations of $0.14 per share.  This is a book entry necessitated by generally accepted accounting principles and complying with SFAS121 relating to the impairment of assets.  The write-down takes into account the cost of any sale and the time value of future cash flows.  The Company has not given up any mining rights and is not anticipating further reductions.  The Company is still seeking a joint venture or sale of the mining assets.       A decision was made to close the insurance business segment as of June 30, 1997.  This segment reported losses in both years and efforts to improve performance have not been successful.  Management felt the closure would conserve cash and shift resources toward the remaining core businesses.  The operating losses and write-off of the investment are reported under discontinued operations.  All anticipated expenses associated with the closure have been accrued in the 1997 statements.       Cash flow from continuing operating activities for current fiscal year end was a negative $1,233,000.  This is an improvement of $1,573,000 over the prior comparable period.  Management expects this trend to continue in the future.       The Company reported a loss per share from continuing operations of $0.14 for 1997.  Eliminating the write-down of the mining properties of $0.08, results in a $0.06 per share loss compared to a loss of $0.10 per share for fiscal year 1996.                        Fiscal 1996 Compared to Fiscal 1995       Consolidated revenues and expenses for fiscal years 1996 and 1995 have been restated to reflect the shutdown of the insurance segment effective June 30, 1997.  After restatement, the 1996 consolidated revenues increased by 10% over 1995.  The manufacturing revenues, which increased 8% from the prior period, accounted for 88% of consolidated revenues for fiscal year 1996.  The food distribution segment, which increased from $26,000 to $463,000, made up the balance of the revenues.                                                20        During 1996, 61% of food service revenue was generated from the sale of equipment.  The Company is currently retaining ownership of the equipment, ultimately leading to a significant increase in gross profit. The Company has an agreement in place for the sale of pollution control equipment which will not be installed or revenue recognized until after fiscal year end.  See Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional segment information.        For the year ended June 30, 1996, the restated consolidated loss from continuing operations was $3,205,000 compared to a loss of $4,753,000 in the prior year.  Fiscal year 1995 included a write down of assets of $1,743,000.  Loss from operations increased by $506,000 over the prior year.  Included in this increase is $262,000 due to higher depreciation and amortization of goodwill expense.       Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $808,000.  The food service segment, reporting for a full fiscal year, represented $489,000 or 61% of the increase.  The manufacturing segment represented 18% of the increase.  During 1996, the Company increased its marketing efforts especially in the food service and pollution control equipment segments, established a shareholder relations department and developed an information retrieval system for Fry Guy Inc.   Product and Environmental Contingencies       The Company is not aware of any material product or environmental liabilities.
