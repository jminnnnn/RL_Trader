ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION                 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The Company refers to Alanco Technologies, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  As discussed below and in footnotes to the Company’s attached consolidated financial statements, at June 30, 2011 the Company was effectively a holding company without operating entities.  The Company had stated in previous filings that its objective was to complete an appropriate merger (possibly a reverse merger) and remain an operating publicly traded company.    In previous SEC filings, Alanco reported three business segments: Data Storage, Wireless Asset Management and RFID Technology.  During fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the Company announced a plan to divest the operations of the Company’s Data Storage segment and reinvest the proceeds in to the remaining operating units.  The divestiture plan was expanded during the quarter ended September 30, 2009 when the Company announced its plan to sell its RFID Technology segment.  Finally, the plan was expanded further when, on February 23, 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement, subject to shareholder approval, to sell its Wireless Asset Management segment.  In compliance with the divestiture plan, the Data Storage segment was sold in March 2010 and the RFID Technology segment was sold in August 2010.  The sale of the Wireless Asset Management segment was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual meeting on May 10, 2011, with the transaction closing approximately one week later.  As a result, as of June 30, 2011 all segment operations had been sold and the segment’s operating results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were reported as Discontinued Operations.   Prior period activity has been reclassified to report operating segments as discontinued operations and certain balances have been reclassified in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform with the current year’s presentation.    Critical Accounting Policies    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” discusses our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions concerning classification and valuation of investments, valuation of contingent and non-cash consideration received in the sale of the Wireless Asset Management segment, the estimated fair value of stock based compensation, expense recognition, realization of deferred tax assets and accruals and contingencies.  We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  The result of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making conclusions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.    The SEC suggests that all registrants list their most “critical accounting policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.  A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Management has identified the critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  The Company’s Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the critical accounting policies identified.     These policies include, but are not limited to, the reclassification and valuation of marketable securities and fair value of financial instruments.        9            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES        Results of Operations     In compliance with the Company’s previously announced divestiture plan and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the Company is not reporting operating revenues for fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 because, as of June 30, 2011 all business segments had been sold.  Fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 operating results for the business segments are reported as Discontinued Operations.    Operating Expense  Operating expense for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011 was $1,179,800, an increase of $233,500, or 24.7%, compared to the $946,300 reported for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010.  The increase was due to increases in salary compensation and increases in stock based compensation related to the repricing in fiscal year 2011 of certain stock options.  The Company had reduced executive salary levels during fiscal year 2010 to conserve cash and had reinstated the original compensation levels on July 1, 2010 under the agreement that the salary increases would be deferred until Company shareholders had an opportunity to approve the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan.  That plan would allow the deferred amounts to be paid in Class A Common Stock of the Company.  The 2011 Stock Incentive Plan was approved by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 10, 2011 with the stock payments completed by June 30, 2011.  Amortization of stock-based compensation (Black Scholes value of granted and repriced stock options) increased $91,600, or 84.4%, to $200,100, compared to $108,500 reported for the previous year due to the re-pricing of certain stock options in September 2010.  Depreciation expense was $1,000 in fiscal 2011 compared to $800 in fiscal 2010.    Other Income and Expense  Net interest expense decreased $412,200, or 47.8%, to $450,100 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared to net interest expense of $862,300 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010.  The decrease in interest expense resulted from reductions in average interest rates paid and average borrowing during the year.    Loss from Continuing Operations  Loss from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011 was ($1,839,500), a 4.3%, or $81,900 improvement when compared to the loss of ($1,921,400) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010.  The improvement was due to decreases in interest expense of $412,200 offset by increases in operating loss.    Discontinued Operations  Total Consolidated Income from Discontinued Operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011 was $1,781,700 compared to a loss of ($7,206,000) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010, an improvement of $8,987,700.  $6,320,900 of the improvement resulted from reduced losses in discontinued operations, reporting a consolidated loss of ($885,100) in the current fiscal year compared to a loss of ($7,206,000), including ($4,873,700) of goodwill impairment charges, reported for the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2010;  $1,294,000 of the improvement was due to a gain on sale of Assets Held for Sale reported for year ended June 30, 2011, compared to zero reported on Sale of Assets Held for Sale in the prior year; and finally, $1,372,800 of the improvement resulted from the income recognized on dissolution of Alanco/TSI PRISM, Inc. (“TSI”), previously classified as discontinued operations.  The assets of TSI were sold in a transaction discussed in the attached audited financial statements with proceeds of the sale going to secured lenders; therefore, TSI does not have assets available to satisfy the $1,372,800 in recorded liabilities at time of dissolution of the subsidiary.  The stock of the subsidiary was sold in June 2011 to an independent third party for an immaterial amount.  Given these facts and circumstances and discussion with legal counsel, Alanco believes that it has no exposure to these liabilities.  See Note 5 – Sale of Operating Segments for additional discussion of the sale of segment operations.      The following table is a summary of the results of discontinued operations and other financial information by major segment:          10            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Discontinued Operations Gross Profit  Consolidated gross profit from discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2011 amounted to $5,580,000, a decrease of $170,900, or 3.0%, compared to $5,750,900 in gross profit reported for fiscal year 2010.  The Wireless Asset Management portion of the gross profit amounted to $5,566,500, representing an increase of $209,700, or 3.9%, compared to $5,356,800 reported for the year ended June 30, 2010.  The increase in Wireless Asset Management portion of gross profit reflects improved gross margins realized during the ten and one half months reporting period in fiscal 2011 compared to gross margins realized for the twelve month reporting period in the prior fiscal year.  The net decrease in gross profit was due to the sale of the RFID Technology segment in early fiscal year 2011 and the Data Storage segment in fiscal year 2010 as previously discussed.        11            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES           Discontinued Operations Selling, General & Administrative Expense  Wireless Asset Management segment reported total selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses, of $6,351,800, an increase of $357,600, or 6.0%, compared to $5,994,200 reported for the prior year.  The increase was primarily due to higher selling and engineering costs compared to the prior year.  SG&A comparisons for the RFID and Data Storage segments are not relevant due their previous discussed segment sales.    The Company recorded, during fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, an impairment charge of $4.5 million against the goodwill value of the RFID Technology segment in recognition of reduced value substantiated by the terms of the August 2010 sale of the RFID Technology segment.  The Data Storage segment also recorded a $373,700 impairment charge against Data Storage segment goodwill in fiscal year 2010 in recognition of reduced segment values.    Net Loss  Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2011 was ($57,800) compared to a loss of ($9,127,400).  The $9,069,600 improvement resulted from improvements in discontinued operations as discussed above.    Dividends  Preferred stock dividend expense for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011 was $268,700, a decrease of $116,600, or 30.3%, compared to the $385,300 in preferred stock dividends recorded in the twelve months ended June 30, 2010.  The decrease was due to the conversion of convertible preferred shares into Class A Common Shares, the acquisition and retirement of 500,000 shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Shares from ORBCOMM who submitted the shares as additional consideration in the purchase of StarTrak and the retirement of preferred stock outstanding through an exchange offer whereby the Company exchanged the remaining Series D and Series E convertible Preferred Stock for ORBCOMM Series A preferred stock acquired in the sale of StarTrak to ORBCOMM.  At June 30, 2011, no Series D and Series E preferred stock remained outstanding.    Net Loss Attributable to Common Shareholders  Net Loss Attributable to Common Shareholders for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011 amounted to ($326,500), or ($.06) per share, an improvement of $9,186,200 when compared to a loss of ($9,512,700), or ($2.22) per share, reported in the twelve months ended June 30, 2010.  The improvement is reflective of the Company’s divestiture plan resulting in the sale of its RFID Technology and Wireless Asset Management segments during the current fiscal year.    Other Comprehensive Income  The Company reported market value gain on securities held during the twelve months ended June 30, 2011 of $466,500.  The marketable securities consisted of ORBCOMM (NASDAQ: ORBC) Common Stock that the Company received in the sale of the assets of its StarTrak subsidiary to ORBCOMM.  The amount represents the increase in market value between the closing of the May 16, 2011 sale transaction of $2.91 per share and the $3.13 per share market value at June 30, 2011.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    The Company’s current assets exceeded its current liabilities by $7,028,400 at June 30, 2011, representing a current ratio of 13.1 to 1.  At June 30, 2010 the Company's current assets exceeded current liabilities by $9,983,300 and reflected a current ratio of 1.95 to 1.  The improvement in current ratio at June 30, 2011 versus June 30, 2010 resulted from the assets received and debt paid in the Company’s sale of its StarTrak Systems, LLC subsidiary to ORBCOMM Inc.    Net cash used in continuing operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was ($1,386,500) compared with net cash used in operating activities for the prior fiscal year of ($3,686,700).  The decrease of $2,300,200 resulted from a significant reduction in loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year.  See below for management's discussion of major items affecting the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.    Consolidated accounts receivable at June 30, 2011 was $149,900 compared to no accounts receivable at June 30, 2010 and represents amounts due the Company related to the sale of its StarTrak Systems, LLC subsidiary.        12            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES         Net cash provided from investing activities during the current year was $3,026,600, an increase of $3,002,300 compared to net cash provided in investing activities in fiscal 2010 of $24,300.   The current year increase was due primarily to the sale of the Company’s Wireless Asset Management and RFID Technology segments.    Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 amounted to ($1,257,400), a decrease of $4,906,800 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $3,649,400 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.  During fiscal year 2010, the Company raised over $3.1 million through the sale of preferred stock.  During the current fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Company repaid net borrowings by $2,427,900 compared to increase in net borrowing for the year ended June 30, 2010 of $264,400.    At June 30, 2011, the Company reported approximately $6.6 million in ORBCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:  ORBC) Common Stock which it received as part of the Company’s sale of its StarTrak Systems, LLC subsidiary in May 2011.  See Note 6 – Marketable Securities – Restricted to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the ORBCOMM investment.     Although management cannot assure that a future operation will be acquired, or that it will achieve projections, or that additional debt and/or equity will not be required, we believe our cash balances at year end, operating projections, and working capital will provide adequate capital resources to maintain operations as they currently exist for the next year.  If additional working capital is required during fiscal 2012 due to an acquisition or merger and not obtained through additional long-term debt, equity capital or operations, it could adversely affect future operations.  Management has historically been successful in obtaining financing and has demonstrated the ability to implement a number of cost-cutting initiatives to reduce working capital needs.  Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate and do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
