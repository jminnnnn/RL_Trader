ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION                 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    During fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the Company formed AES as a wholly owned subsidiary and constructed the Deer Creek water treatment and disposal facility located near Grand Junction, CO.  The facility started to receive produced water in August 2012.  During fiscal 2014 and 2013, the Company continued the permitting process for the 160 acre site known as Indian Mesa for water treatment and disposal and a landfill/land farm operation.    Current Status of Deer Creek facility    The Deer Creek produced water disposal facility, located near Grand Junction, CO, became operational in August 2012 with annual evaporative capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels, providing Piceance Basin producers with significant transportation cost savings compared to alternative water disposal sites.  In November 2013, the facility received approval from the Mesa County Board of Commissioners allowing 24 hours a day, seven days per week operations for one year and the Company is currently reapplying for an extension.  The facility had previously been restricted to daylight hours Monday through Saturday.    Current Status of Indian Mesa facility    The permitting process for the Indian Mesa facility, located approximately 4 miles North West of the Deer Creek site, has been in process for a number of years with an initial County Use Permit issued in 2010 covering, among other things, evaporation ponds and land farming.  In December 2013, in response to an AES request to amend its County Use Permit (“CUP”), the Mesa County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved a new CUP for AES to construct and operate on its 160 acre Indian Mesa site evaporation ponds and/or landfill for disposal of solid oil and gas (O&G) waste, such as drill cuttings, tank bottoms, sock filters, etc.  The approval also allows for solid and produced water disposal of Naturally-Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) and Technically Enhanced Naturally-Occurring Radioactive Materials (TENORM).  In June 2014 AES received final construction approval from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) for twelve produced water disposal ponds, which if developed as planned, would be located on the north 80 acres of the Indian Mesa site.    The capacity of Indian Mesa is dependent on its type of development, which the Company is still planning.  If 80 acres is developed as 12 ponds as discussed above, the annual capacity at Indian Mesa for produced water, not considering enhanced evaporation, would be approximately 1 million barrels.  If the remaining 80 acres were developed into landfills, the capacity would be approximately 3 million cubic yards.  If the entire 160 acres were developed into landfill, the solid waste capacity would increase to approximately 8 million cubic yards.  Complete build-out of its Indian Mesa facility, including both landfill and evaporative ponds, would result in a unique Western Colorado “one stop shop” for all O&G waste products, including NORM and TENORM contaminated waste streams.    Critical Accounting Policies    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” discusses our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions concerning classification and valuation of investments, the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation, realization of deferred tax assets, collectability of accounts and note receivable, estimated useful lives and carrying value of fixed assets, the recorded values of accruals and contingencies including the estimated fair values of the Company’s asset retirement obligation and the contingent land and purchase price liabilities, and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  The result of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making conclusions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.           7            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES       The SEC suggests that all registrants discuss their most “critical accounting policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.  A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Management has identified the critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  The Company’s Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the critical accounting policies identified.  These policies include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, the classification and valuation of marketable securities, realization of accounts and note receivable, stock-based compensation, the recorded values of accruals and fair values of assets and liabilities including the Company’s contingent liabilities.    Revenue Recognition  The Company uses four factors to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition.  Three of these factors are generally factual considerations that are not subject to material estimates (evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been performed and the fee is determinable).  The fourth factor includes judgment regarding the collectability of the sales price.  The Company’s written arrangement with customers establishes payment terms and the Company only enters into arrangements when it has reasonable assurance that it will receive payment from the customer.  The assessment of a customer’s credit-worthiness is reliant on management’s judgment on factors such as credit references and market reputation.  If any sales are made that become uncollectible, the Company establishes a reserve for the uncollectible amount.    Classification and Valuation of Marketable Securities  The Company classifies its investments in marketable securities at the time of acquisition and reviews such classifications at each balance sheet date.  Marketable securities are classified as held to maturity, trading, or available for sale depending on the Company’s ability and plans for sale.  Marketable securities are valued based on their classification.  The Company’s current marketable securities on hand are classified as available for sale and are measured at fair value on a recurring basis by using quoted market prices.  The cost of the securities sold is based on average cost of the security.    Realization of Accounts and Note Receivable  The Company uses the allowance method for potentially uncollectible trade accounts and note receivable.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is established based a review of outstanding account balances.  The Company reviews payment history and credit worthiness in the determination of its allowance for doubtful accounts.  In addition, the Company has reviewed ACC projected revenues, related assumptions and cash flows when evaluating the collectability of the note receivable.    Stock-Based Compensation  The Company has stock-based compensation plans and the associated compensation cost is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes valuation model using the following inputs:  the plain-vanilla method for expected term based on the contractual term and vesting period of the award, the expected volatility of daily changes in the market price of the Company’s common stock, the assumed risk-free interest rate and an assumption of future forfeitures based on historical cancellations and management’s analysis of potential forfeitures.    Recorded Values of Accruals  The Company makes accruals for liabilities based on reasonable estimates for known or anticipated obligations.  Estimates may be based on known inputs, experience with similar situations, or anticipated outcomes.  Estimates for the Company’s asset retirement obligation and contingent payments are determined at discrete points in time based upon unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists that is significant to the fair value of the liability, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.  Estimates for the asset retirement obligation were developed by a consultant knowledgeable about the State of Colorado regulatory requirements and use vendor estimates for the various activities required for the closure of the Deer Creek facility.  Estimates for the contingent payments were calculated based on projected income, cash flows and capital expenditures for the Deer Creek and Indian Mesa facilities under current plans.           8            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES       Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities  The Company estimates fair values for assets and liabilities at certain points in time based on information known at that time using the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and recognizes transfers as they occur.  The ASC uses a three level hierarchy:  Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets, Level 2 – observable inputs, other than quoted prices included with Level 1, and Level 3 – unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists that are significant to the fair value.  The fair value of the Company’s Marketable Securities is based on Level 1 inputs using ORBCOMM’s quoted prices.  The asset retirement obligation and contingent payments discussed above use Level 3 inputs.    Results of Operations    Net Revenues  Revenues for the year ended June 30, 2014 were $649,000 as compared to revenues for the year ended June 30, 2013 of $390,600, an increase of $258,400, or 66.2%.  Revenues are comprised of produced water delivery fees and sales of reclaimed oil.  Revenues for fiscal 2014 were concentrated approximately 87.9% with four customers versus revenues for fiscal 2013 which were concentrated approximately 96.6% to two customers.  The significant customers represented $77,700, or 79.5% of the accounts receivable balance at June 30, 2014, while the significant customers for fiscal 2013 did not have any accounts receivable balances outstanding at June 30, 2013.  The change in concentrations is representative of the Company’s continued development of relationships with customers in the region, which the Company anticipates to continue to improve. Revenues can be impacted by weather conditions, the prices of oil and gas which may impact drilling activities in the region, and alternative uses of produced water, such as for fracking fluid that some current and potential customers are utilizing.    Cost of Revenues  Cost of revenues for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 were $447,700 and $402,000, respectively, an increase of $45,700 or 11.4%.  Cost of revenues consists of direct labor costs, equipment costs (including depreciation), land lease costs and other operating costs.  The increase is due to higher depreciation in the current year plus additional pond maintenance costs.  Fixed costs such as depreciation, amortization, accretion and lease costs represent approximately 50% and 47% of the cost of revenues for the fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2014 was $201,300 with a gross margin of 31% and for the year ended June 30, 2013 was a gross (loss) of ($11,400).  The improvement is primarily due to increased revenues and gross profit is anticipated to improve as revenue increases.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 (consisting of corporate expenses, AES selling, general and administrative expense, amortization of stock-based compensation and impairment charges) was $1,278,500, a decrease of $254,800, or 16.6%, compared to $1,533,300 reported for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. During fiscal 2014, the allocation of corporate service cost to AES was increased.  As a result, total corporate expenses plus AES selling, general and administrative expense are being compared in this discussion.  For fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, corporate expense plus AES selling, general and administrative expense was $1,118,000 as compared to $1,294,700 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of $176,700, or 13.6%.  The combined decrease is primarily due to a reduction in corporate salaries reflecting a change in staff levels and a decrease in fees paid for professional services, offset by increases in legal expense.  Amortization of stock-based compensation for the fiscal year 2014 is zero as compared to $238,600 for fiscal year 2013.  There were no new stock options grants during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $160,500 related to an injection well located on the Deer Creek property.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company met with State of Colorado officials regarding the injection well permit and due to the length of time the process was taking and the uncertainty of a positive outcome, decided to record the impairment charge.    Operating Loss  Operating Loss for the year ended June 30, 2014 was ($1,077,200), a decrease of $467,500, or 30.3%, compared to an Operating Loss of ($1,544,700) reported for the prior year.  The decreased operating loss resulted from an increase in revenues and a corresponding increase in gross profit as well as a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013.             9            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES        Other Income and Expense  Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2014 was $37,500, an improvement of $14,600 when compared to interest income of $22,900 for the year ended June 30, 2013.  The increase in interest income related to the increase in the outstanding amount of the ACC note and the increase in the interest rate effective during the current fiscal year.    During fiscal year 2014, the Company recorded a gain of $121,700 on the settlement of the fuel sensor escrow and working capital adjustment related to the sales of its StarTrak subsidiary in fiscal 2011 to ORBCOMM.  In addition, the Company recorded a gain of $913,800 on the sale of 349,192 shares of ORBCOMM Common Stock at an average selling price of $6.08 as compared to the prior fiscal year which has a gain of $751,500 on the sale of 747,873 shares of its ORBCOMM Common Stock at an average selling price of $3.91 per share plus a gain of $86,800 on the sale of its Symbius investment.  Finally, the Company had $102,000 of other expense during the year ended June 30, 2014 as compared to other income of $500 reported in the comparable period of the prior year.  Other expense in fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of an accrual recorded for a legal matter for which the Company is pursuing an appeal offset by other income from the amendment fee negotiated on the ACC note during the current year.    Net Loss  Net Loss for the year ended June 30, 2014 was ($106,200), a decrease of $576,800, or 84.5%, when compared to the net loss of ($683,000) for the previous year ended June 30, 2013.  The decrease in net loss was primarily due to the improved revenue and gross profit and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses during the current year.    Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive Income for the year ended June 30, 2014 represents the unrealized change in market value of the Company’s Marketable Securities held at June 30, 2014 compared to June 30, 2013.  Comprehensive income for the year ended June 30, 2014 consisted of the net value of three items:  1) the reclassification adjustment for realized gains included in Net Income of $913,800; 2) an Unrealized Loss on Marketable Securities, net of tax, of ($65,600) resulting from a decrease in the market value of the shares held at June 30, 2014 compared to the market value at June 30, 2013, and; 3) the net unrealized gain on marketable securities sold during the period of $550,700.  At June 30, 2014 the Company valued 85,000 shares of ORBCOMM, Inc. Common Stock at $6.59 per share for a total value of $560,100.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    The Company’s current assets exceeded its current liabilities by $2,066,400 at June 30, 2014, representing a current ratio of 7.3 to 1.  At June 30, 2013 the Company's current assets exceeded current liabilities by $2,526,500 and reflected a current ratio of 10.3 to 1.  The decrease in current ratio at June 30, 2014 versus June 30, 2013 resulted primarily from the sale of marketable securities, proceeds of which were primarily used to invest in Land, Property and Equipment, pay ORBCOMM pursuant to the StarTrak sale, and fund operating losses.    Net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 was ($769,700) compared with net cash used in operating activities for the prior fiscal year of ($1,588,200).  The decrease of $818,500 resulted primarily from a $308,900 decrease in net loss before non-cash income and expenses and $622,300 changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses, offset by $77,600 change in accounts receivable and $86,000 change in prepaid expenses.  Overall, the decrease in cash used in operations reflects an increase in sales as AES increased its customer base in its second year of operations.    Consolidated receivables at June 30, 2014 were $106,000 compared to receivables at June 30, 2013 of $42,400.  The receivables at June 30, 2014 relate to $96,800 of trade receivables for AES plus $9,200 of receivables from ACC.  The receivable at June 30, 2013 relate to $9,600 of trade receivables for AES plus $32,800 of receivables from ACC.    Net cash provided by investing activities during the current year was $1,315,000, a decrease of $924,300 compared to net cash provided by investing activities in the prior year of $2,239,300.   The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $803,800 and an increase in expenditures for payments pursuant to the StarTrak sale of $643,800, offset by a reduction in expenditures of approximately $792,200 for the purchase of land, property and equipment.    Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 amounted to ($26,100), a decrease of $212,900 compared to net cash used in financing activities of ($239,000) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.  The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in net repayment of borrowings offset by a small increase in the purchase of treasury shares.           10            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES       At June 30, 2014, the Company reported Marketable Securities that consisted of 85,000 shares of ORBCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ: ORBC) Common Stock, valued at approximately $560,100, or $6.59 per share.  The shares were received as part of the Company’s asset sale of its StarTrak Systems, LLC subsidiary in May 2011.  At June 30, 2014, these available for sale securities were valued using a Level 1 fair value measurement based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets which is more fully described in Note 1 – Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements.   At June 30, 2013, the Company held approximately 348,011 shares of ORBCOMM Common Stock valued at approximately $1.6 million.  We anticipate selling the remaining stock over a period of time to maximize our return.  As long as the ORBCOMM Common Stock constitutes a substantial portion of our assets, fluctuations in the market price of such stock may significantly affect our value.  See Note 4 – Marketable Securities to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the ORBCOMM investment.    The Company has made a significant investment through June 30, 2014 in Alanco Energy Services, Inc. investing approximately $1.5 million in land and $2.9 million in evaporation ponds and equipment for the Deer Creek water disposal site.  The Company plans on continuing its sale of ORBCOMM stock discussed above to fund the additional investments.    The Company has a note receivable from American Citizenship Center, LLC (“ACC”), a related party, established to provide ACC working capital.  As of June 30, 2014, the note has an outstanding balance of $409,000.  The note is secured by all assets of ACC and bears interest at the rate of 9% per annum.  Under the agreement and amendments thereto, the Company was issued a total of 300,000 warrants to purchase membership units of ACC at an exercise price of $1.00 per unit.  The expiration date of the warrants are August 31, 2016 and the value of said warrants is considered immaterial at both June 30, 2014 and 2013 due to the startup nature of ACC and the premium exercise price compared to the most recent membership unit sales, therefore, no value has been recorded for these warrants.    Although management cannot assure that it will achieve projections, or that additional debt and/or equity will not be required, we believe our cash balances at year end, projected cash flows from operations, and working capital will provide adequate capital resources to maintain operations as they currently exist for the next year.  If additional working capital is required during fiscal 2015 due to an acquisition or merger and not obtained through additional long-term debt, equity capital or operations, it could adversely affect future operations.  Management has historically been successful in obtaining financing and has demonstrated the ability to implement a number of cost-cutting initiatives to reduce working capital needs.
