ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION                 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Critical Accounting Policies    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” discusses our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation allowances for inventory and receivables, estimated fair value of stock based compensation, warranty reserves, percentage of completion method of accounting, income and expense recognition, realization of deferred tax assets and investments, and impairment of long-lived and intangible assets.  We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  The result of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making conclusions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.    The SEC suggests that all registrants list their most “critical accounting policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.  A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Management has identified the critical accounting policies presented below as those accounting policies that affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  The Company’s Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the critical accounting policies identified.    These policies include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, estimates related to the valuation of inventory and receivables and the ultimate resolution of the current StarTrak litigation that is more fully discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings.    Results of Operations    In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the Company is reporting revenues for fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 from StarTrak Systems, LLC, its Wireless Asset Management segment. The RFID Technology and Data Storage segments, reported as operating segments in prior years, are reported as discontinued operations on the accompanying financial statements.            9                  ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

If the RFID Technology and Data Storage segments had been included in the consolidated operating results, consolidated sales for the year ended June 30, 2010 would have been $16,435,900 compared to $21,259,100 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, a decrease of $4,823,200, or 22.7%.            10               ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES       Gross Profit     The Company reported gross profit for fiscal year 2010 of $5,968,000 (40.8% of sales), an increase of $2,020,500 or 51.2%, when compared to $3,947,500 (29.0% of sales) for the prior year.  The improvement in gross margin resulted from improved margins in sales for both hardware products and monitoring services.  The increase in both gross profit and gross margin was due primarily to reduced warranty costs related to an early version of ReeferTrak product shipments that negatively affected margins, and the completion of low margin hardware sales in the prior year required to convert several major customers from analog to digital products.  Gross margin can be impacted by economic conditions and specific market pressures.  As a result, the change in gross margin reported for the current period is not considered to be a trend. Management does expect fiscal year gross margins will continue to improve compared to the same periods in the prior year, although the gross margin improvement may not be as significant as was reported for the year ended June 30, 2010.    If the RFID Technology and Data Storage segments had been included in consolidated operating results, consolidated gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2010 would have increased to $6,362,100 (38.7% of sales), a decrease of $99,100, or 1.5%, compared to $6,461,200 that would have been reported for the same period of the prior year.    Selling, General & Administrative Expense    Fiscal year 2010 total Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, including stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization decreased to $7,661,000, a decrease of $339,300, or  4.2%, when compared to $8,000,300 reported for fiscal year 2009.  The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in reported stock based compensation from $1,412,400 in fiscal year 2009 to $400,300 in the current fiscal year due to the FYE 2009 election to change certain amortization assumptions ($135,000), change stock option vesting for Company directors and officers ($700,000) and to reprice certain employee stock options ($166,900) for a total cost of approximately $1 million.    SG&A expense, excluding corporate expense, stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization actually increased by $607,800, or 11.8%, to $5,779,500 from $5,171,700 reported for fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 due to increases in sales and marketing, engineering and administrative expenses.  Corporate expenses increased to $946,300, an increase of $30,500, or 3.3%, compared to $915,800 reported for fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.  Stock based compensation for the year ended June 30, 2010 decreased significantly to $400,300, a decrease of $1,012,100, or 71.7% from $1,412,400 for the year ended June 30, 2009 as discussed above, and depreciation and amortization increased slightly to $534,900, a 6.9% increase from the $500,400 reported in the previous year.    If the discontinued operations had been included in consolidated operating results, total SG&A expenses for the year ended June 30, 2010 would have been $14,623,700, an increase of $3,957,600, or 37.1% when compared to $10,666,100 that would have been reported in fiscal year 2009.  The increase resulted from $4,873,700 in impairment charges recorded during the current fiscal year to reduce the value of Assets Held for Sale.  Excluding the impairment charges, total SG&A expense for the current fiscal year would have decreased $916,100 from $10,666,100 reported in fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 to $9,750,000 reported in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.    Operating Loss     The operating loss for fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was ($1,693,000), a $2,359,800, or 58%, improvement when compared to the operating loss for the prior fiscal year of ($4,052,800).  The significant improvement in operating loss was due primarily to improved gross profit margins on both hardware product sales and monitoring services revenue.  If the discontinued operations had been included in the consolidated operating results, consolidated operating loss for the year ended June 30, 2010 would have been ($8,261,600), an increase of ($4,056,700), a 96% increase when compared to the operating loss (including discontinued operations) of ($4,204,900), primarily due to the previously discussed impairment charges of $4,873,700 recorded in fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.            11               ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES      Loss From Continuing Operations    The loss from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was ($2,558,800), a $2,737,600 improvement when compared to the loss from continuing operations of ($5,296,400) reported for fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.   The decrease in loss from continuing operations resulted from the improvement in reported operating loss for the current fiscal year discussed above, a decrease in interest expense from $900,700 in fiscal year 2009 to $862,300 in the current fiscal year due to a fiscal year 2009 interest charge of $216,000 related to a prepayment on the ComVest term loan, and the reduction of other expense of $339,400, from ($342,900) in fiscal year 2009 to ($3,500) in the current fiscal year, due to a $345,100 charge recorded during fiscal year 2009 to reduce the estimated value of the Company’s investment in TSIN.    The operations of TSI were acquired in May of 2002 by the issuance of 2.4 million (post October 16, 2006 reverse split) shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and the assumptions of certain specific liabilities.  In anticipation of the transaction, the Company had acquired approximately 8.9% of the then outstanding shares of TSIN.  TSIN had stated it was its intent to liquidate enough shares of the Alanco stock to pay off all TSIN liabilities and to distribute the remaining Alanco shares to the TSIN stockholders.  To reflect the 8.9% investment in TSIN subsequent to the acquisition, the Company estimated that approximately 2.25 million shares would be remaining after payment of all TSIN liabilities and that an 8.9% ownership would receive approximately 200,000 shares upon distribution.  Therefore, the Company recorded 200,000 treasury shares valued at market price on the transaction date.    On January 30, 2003, a shareholder of TSIN filed suit naming as defendants the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, ATSI.  The complaint set forth various allegations and sought damages arising out of the Company's acquisition of substantially all of the assets of TSIN.  Eventually, the lawsuit was transferred to TSIN who became the plaintiff and continued the legal process until September 2007 when the parties to the lawsuit entered into a Settlement Agreement.  From 2003 through September 2007, TSIN incurred significant legal expenses associated with the lawsuit, forcing TSIN to sell a significant portion of the Alanco shares held, thereby reducing the number of Alanco shares available to TSIN shareholders upon distribution.  To reflect that reduction in investment value of the Company’s 8.9% ownership in TSIN, the Company, during fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, reduced the estimated number of treasury shares to be acquired upon distribution from 200,000 shares to 16,000 shares and recorded a charge to other expenses of $345,100.    Loss From Discontinued Operations    The loss from discontinued operations represents the operating results for the Data Storage and RFID Technology segments which have been classified as Assets Held for Sale.  The Data Storage operations were sold in the third quarter ended March 31, 2010 and the RFID Technology segment was sold subsequent to June 30, 2010 in the first quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 the loss from discontinued operations was ($6,568,600) or ($1.53) per share compared to a loss from discontinued operations of   ($152,100), or ($.04) per share.  $4,873,700, or ($1.13) per share of the increased loss from discontinued operations related to impairment charges recorded in fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.    EBITDAS    The Company believes that (loss) earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation (EBITDAS), is an important measure used by management to measure performance.  EBITDAS may also be used by certain investors to compare and analyze our operating results between accounting periods.  However, EBITDAS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows or other financial statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of our performance or liquidity.  EBITDAS for Alanco’s fiscal year 2010 represents a loss of ($761,300) compared to a loss of ($2,482,800) for the same period of the prior year.  EBITDA before stock-based compensation decreased to ($1,161,600) compared to ($3,895,300) reported in the prior period an improvement of $2,733,700 or 70%.  Reconciliation between EBITDAS and Loss From Continuing Operations is presented below:            12               ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES         EBITDA RECONCILIATION TO LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS                                       Fiscal Years Ended               June 30, 2010          June 30, 2009        EBITDA before Stock-based compensation      $  (761,300  )     $  (2,482,800  )                                 Stock-based compensation         (400,300  )        (1,412,500  )                                  EBITDA      $  (1,161,600  )     $  (3,895,300  )                                  Net interest expense         (862,300  )        (900,700  )    Depreciation and amortization         (534,900  )        (500,400  )                                  LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS      $  (2,558,800  )     $  (5,296,400  )      Dividends    Preferred Stock dividends expensed during fiscal year 2010 amounted to $385,300, including preferred stock dividends of $200,000 paid in-kind, $81,000 paid in Class A Common Stock, $17,200 paid by note payable, $30,700 paid in cash and $56,400 accrued but unpaid at June 30, 2010.  The $385,300 in preferred dividend expense was a significant decrease compared to Preferred Stock dividends of $478,200 paid in the prior year.  The decrease is due to the conversion of approximately $1.7 million of Series D into Notes Payable in November 2009 and therefore the elimination of associated dividends.  See Note 12 – Shareholders’ Equity for additional discussion of Preferred Stock transactions.    Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders    Consolidated net loss attributable to Common stockholders for fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was ($9,512,700), or ($2.22) per share, an increase of 60.5% when compared to a net loss attributable to Common stockholders of ($5,926,700), or ($1.49) per share, for the prior year.           Any new FASB Accounting Standards Codification updates affecting the Company are disclosed in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included under Item 8 to this Form 10-K.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    The Company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $3,388,900 at June 30, 2010, representing a current ratio of .67 to 1.  At June 30, 2009 the Company's current assets exceeded current liabilities by $5,209,500 and  reflected a current ratio of 1.74 to 1.  The deterioration in current ratio at June 30, 2010 versus June 30, 2009 resulted from Operating Losses during the twelve-month period, including $4,873,700 in impairment charges, and the recording of all notes payable at June 30, 2010 as current due to the January 1, 2011 maturity date of the line of credit agreement with a balance at June 30, 2010 of $5.7 million with the Anderson Trust.  The Company is committed to either retire the balance or extend the due date of the loan.            Net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was ($3,686,700) compared with net cash used in operating activities for the prior fiscal year of ($1,476,500).  The increase of ($2,210,200) resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable of $190,900 during the current fiscal year (compared to a accounts receivable decrease of $487,600 in the prior period), an increase of $304,400 in inventories in fiscal year 2010 compared to a $1.9 million increase in the prior year and an approximate $1.5 million reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities compared to an increase in the prior year of $117,800.  See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for management's discussion of major items affecting the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.     Consolidated accounts receivable at June 30, 2010 of $2,493,900, fifty-five days’ sales in receivables, reflects an increase of $190,900, or 8.3%, compared to the $2,303,000, forty days’ sales in receivables, reported at the end of fiscal year 2009.  The increase in days’ sales was reported in all segments.            13               ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES       The Wireless Asset Management segment reported an Accounts Receivable balance at June 30, 2010 of $2,289,000, or 91.8% of the current fiscal year end consolidated balance, compared to 64.5% of the consolidated balance at the prior fiscal year end.  The $2,289,000 June 30, 2010 balance for the Wireless Asset Management segment represented fifty-seven days’ sales compared to an accounts receivable balance at June 30, 2009 of $1,484,600, representing forty days’ sales.  The increase in days’ sales resulted from an increase in Accounts Receivable resulting from a 32.4% increase in the fourth quarter sales as compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year.    Receivables for the Data Storage segment decreased by $11,500, or 14.1%, and RFID Technology segment decreased by $601,900, or 81.7%.  The Data Storage segment accounts receivable balance at June 30, 2010 of $70,000 represented twenty-six days’ sales in receivables compared to $81,500 or fourteen days, at fiscal year end 2009.  The increase in days’ sales in receivables for the Data Storage segment is due to the balance due by the purchaser of the Data Storage segment.  Days’ sales for the RFID Technology segment, fifty-nine days at June 30, 2010 is higher than the forty-nine days at June 30, 2009 and is primarily due to contract holdback which was received subsequent to year end.    Consolidated inventories at June 30, 2010, excluding inventory presented as “Assets Held for Sale,” amounted to $1,222,500, an increase of $132,200, or 9.8%, when compared to $1,354,700 at June 30, 2009.  The Wireless Asset Management segment inventory of $1,222,500 at June 30, 2010 represents an inventory turnover of 7.1 as compared to 7.0 for the prior fiscal year end.  If the RFID Technology and Data Storage segments were included in consolidated inventories, the inventory at June 30, 2010 would amount to $2,133,400, a decrease of $728,600, or 25.5% as compared to $2,862,000 as of June 30, 2009.  The RFID Technology segment inventory decreased to $860,900 at June 30, 2010, a decrease of $119,100, or 12.2% when compared to $980,000 in the prior year.  The decrease reflects shipments on contracts in progress during the fiscal year.  The Data Storage inventory at June 30, 2010 amounted to $50,000, a decrease of $477,200, or 90.5% when compared to inventory at June 30, 2009 of $527,200.  The decrease is reflective of the sale of Data Storage segment assets during the quarter ended March 31, 2010.

AND SUBSIDIARIES                       Although management cannot assure that future operations will achieve projections, or that additional debt and/or equity will not be required, we believe our cash balances at year end, operating projections, and working capital that we plan on raising during the year, may provide adequate capital resources to maintain operations for the next year.  If additional working capital is required during fiscal 2011 and not obtained through additional long-term debt, equity capital or operations, it could adversely affect future operations.  Management has historically been successful in obtaining financing and has demonstrated the ability to implement a number of cost-cutting initiatives to reduce working capital needs.  Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate and do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  As a result, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 discussing the substantial doubt of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.       ITEM 7A.
