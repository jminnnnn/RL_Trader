ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION                 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    During fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the Company formed AES as a wholly-owned subsidiary and constructed the Deer Creek water treatment and disposal facility located near Grand Junction, CO.  The facility started to receive produced water in August 2012.  During fiscal 2015 and 2014, the Company continued the permitting process for the 160 acre site known as Indian Mesa for water treatment and disposal and a landfill/land farm operation.    Current Status of Deer Creek facility    The Deer Creek produced water disposal facility, located near Grand Junction, CO, became operational in August 2012 with annual evaporative capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels without using enhanced evaporation methods, providing some Piceance Basin producers with significant transportation cost savings compared to alternative water disposal sites.  In November 2014, the facility received approval from the Mesa County Board of Commissioners allowing 24 hours a day, seven days per week operations for two years with an administrative review conducted by the Planning Division after one year.  During fiscal year 2015, the facility experienced anaerobic bacterial conditions in its evaporation ponds and as a result, restricted water intake during the fourth quarter while it was treating the ponds.  The pond conditions have significantly improved and the Company is currently following a bioremediation maintenance program to maintain pond health.  The Company anticipates increased water revenues during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 which will be achieved by allowing increased water deliveries as well as an increase to the average revenue per barrel for water deliveries.    Current Status of Indian Mesa facility    The permitting process for the Indian Mesa facility, located approximately 4 miles North West of the Deer Creek site, has been in process for a number of years with an initial County Use Permit issued in 2010 covering, among other things, evaporation ponds and land farming.  In December 2013, in response to an AES request to amend its County Use Permit (“CUP”), the Mesa County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved a new CUP for AES to construct and operate on its 160 acre Indian Mesa site evaporation ponds and/or landfill for disposal of solid oil and gas (O&G) waste, such as drill cuttings, tank bottoms, sock filters, etc.  The approval also allows for solid and produced water disposal of Naturally-Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) and Technically Enhanced Naturally-Occurring Radioactive Materials (TENORM).  In June 2014 AES received final construction approval from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) for twelve produced water disposal ponds, which if developed as planned, would be located on the north 80 acres of the Indian Mesa site.    The capacity of Indian Mesa is dependent on its type of development, which the Company is still planning.  If 80 acres is developed as 12 ponds as discussed above, the annual capacity at Indian Mesa for produced water, not considering enhanced evaporation, would be approximately 1 million barrels.  If the remaining 80 acres were developed into landfills, the capacity would be approximately 3 million cubic yards.  If the entire 160 acres were developed into landfill, the solid waste capacity would increase to approximately 8 million cubic yards.  Complete build-out of its Indian Mesa facility, including both landfill and evaporative ponds, would result in a unique Western Colorado “one stop shop” for all O&G waste products, including NORM and TENORM contaminated waste streams.    Critical Accounting Policies    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” discusses our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions concerning classification and valuation of investments, the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation, realization of deferred tax assets, collectability of accounts and note receivable, estimated useful lives and carrying value of fixed assets, the recorded values of accruals and contingencies including the estimated fair values of the Company’s asset retirement obligation and the contingent land and purchase price liabilities, and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  The result of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making conclusions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.           7            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES       The SEC suggests that all registrants discuss their most “critical accounting policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.  A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Management has identified the critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  The Company’s Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the critical accounting policies identified.  These policies include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, the classification and valuation of marketable securities, realization of accounts and note receivable, estimated useful lives and carrying value of fixed assets, stock-based compensation, the recorded values of accruals and fair values of assets and liabilities including the Company’s contingent liabilities.    Revenue Recognition  The Company uses four factors to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition.  Three of these factors are generally factual considerations that are not subject to material estimates (evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been performed and the fee is determinable).  The fourth factor includes judgment regarding the collectability of the sales price.  The Company’s written arrangement with customers establishes payment terms and the Company only enters into arrangements when it has reasonable assurance that it will receive payment from the customer.  The assessment of a customer’s credit-worthiness is reliant on management’s judgment on factors such as credit references and market reputation.  If any sales are made that become uncollectible, the Company establishes a reserve for the uncollectible amount.  Any sales tax for which the Company is responsible is recorded as a reduction of the associated revenue.    Classification and Valuation of Marketable Securities  The Company classifies its investments in marketable securities at the time of acquisition and reviews such classifications at each balance sheet date.  Marketable securities are classified as held to maturity, trading, or available for sale depending on the Company’s ability and plans for sale.  Marketable securities are valued based on their classification.  The Company’s current marketable securities on hand are classified as available for sale and are measured at fair value on a recurring basis by using quoted market prices.  The cost of the securities sold is based on average cost of the security.    Realization of Accounts and Note Receivable  The Company uses the allowance method for potentially uncollectible trade accounts and note receivable.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is established based a review of outstanding account balances.  The Company reviews payment history and credit worthiness in the determination of its allowance for doubtful accounts.  In addition, the Company has reviewed the note holder’s projected revenues, related assumptions and cash flows when evaluating the collectability of the note receivable.    Estimated Useful Lives and Carrying Value of Fixed Assets  The Company values fixed assets based on cost and depreciates fixed assets based on estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, generally over a 3 to 20 year period.  Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated and a gain or loss is recorded in the statement of operations.  The Company analyzes the carrying value of fixed assets by reviewing income projections and undiscounted cash flows which include assumptions based on current market conditions for anticipated revenues and expenses.  These assumptions are reasonably likely to change in the future based on changing markets, which may have a material effect.    Stock-Based Compensation  The Company has stock-based compensation plans and the associated compensation cost is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes valuation model using the following inputs:  the plain-vanilla method for expected term based on the contractual term and vesting period of the award, the expected volatility of daily changes in the market price of the Company’s common stock, the assumed risk-free interest rate and an assumption of future forfeitures based on historical cancellations and management’s analysis of potential forfeitures.             8            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES        Recorded Values of Accruals  The Company makes accruals for liabilities based on reasonable estimates for known or anticipated obligations.  Estimates may be based on known inputs, experience with similar situations, or anticipated outcomes.  Estimates for the Company’s asset retirement obligation and contingent payments are determined at discrete points in time based upon unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists that is significant to the fair value of the liability, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.  Estimates for the asset retirement obligation were developed by a consultant knowledgeable about the State of Colorado regulatory requirements and use vendor estimates for the various activities required for the closure of the Deer Creek facility.  Estimates for the contingent payments were calculated based on projected income, cash flows and capital expenditures for the Deer Creek and Indian Mesa facilities under current plans.    Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities  The Company estimates fair values for assets and liabilities at certain points in time based on information known at that time using the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and recognizes transfers as they occur.  The ASC uses a three level hierarchy:  Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets, Level 2 – observable inputs, other than quoted prices included with Level 1, and Level 3 – unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists that are significant to the fair value.  The fair value of the Company’s Marketable Securities is based on Level 1 inputs using ORBCOMM’s quoted prices.  The asset retirement obligation and contingent payments discussed above use Level 3 inputs.    Results of Operations    Net Revenues  Revenues for the year ended June 30, 2015 were $785,700 as compared to revenues for the year ended June 30, 2014 of $638,500, an increase of $147,200, or 23.1%.  Revenues are comprised of produced water delivery fees and sales of reclaimed oil (net of associated taxes).  Revenues for fiscal 2015 were concentrated approximately 85.1% with four customers versus revenues for fiscal 2014 which were concentrated approximately 87.9% to four customers.  The significant customers represented $14,900, or 32.5% of the accounts receivable balance at June 30, 2015, while the significant customers for fiscal 2014 represented $77,700, or 79.5% of the accounts receivable balance outstanding at June 30, 2014.  While the concentration percentages are similar over the last two fiscal years, the Company has continued development of relationships with customers in the region, which the Company anticipates to continue to improve. Revenues can be impacted by weather conditions, the prices of oil and gas which may impact drilling activities in the region, and alternative uses of produced water, such as for fracking fluid that some current and potential customers are utilizing.    Cost of Revenues  Cost of revenues for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $925,700 and $437,200, respectively, an increase of $488,500 or 111.7%.  Cost of revenues consists of direct labor costs, equipment costs (including depreciation), land lease costs, pond maintenance and other operating costs.  The increase is primarily due to higher pond maintenance costs including pond treatments to manage anaerobic bacterial conditions plus associated rental equipment and related fuel costs.  In addition, other variable costs increased due to higher revenues and include labor costs and fees tied to water volumes.  Fixed costs such as depreciation, amortization, accretion and lease costs represent approximately 19% and 50% of the cost of revenues for the fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Fixed costs for the current year decreased due to the reversal of the contingent earn-out and the recovery of the associated amortization.  Gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2015 was a gross (loss) of ($140,000) with a gross margin of (18%) and for the year ended June 30, 2014 was a gross profit of $201,300 with a gross margin of 31%.  The gross loss in the current year is primarily due to the increased pond maintenance costs mentioned above.  Without these extra costs of approximately $418,000, the Company would have had a gross profit of approximately $278,000, or 35%, which would reflect an improvement of $76,700, or 4% improvement in gross margin over the fiscal year 2014.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 (consisting of corporate expenses, AES selling, general and administrative expense and stock-based compensation) was $1,033,800, a decrease of $244,700, or 19.1%, compared to $1,278,500 (consisting of corporate expenses, AES selling, general and administrative expense and impairment charges) reported for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. During fiscal 2015, the allocation of corporate service cost to AES was decreased.  As a result, total corporate expenses plus AES selling, general and administrative expense are being compared in this discussion.  For fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, corporate expense plus AES selling, general and administrative expense was $960,500 as compared to $1,118,000 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, a decrease of $157,500, or 14.1%.  The combined decrease is primarily due to a reduction in corporate salaries and benefits reflecting a change in staff levels and a decrease in travel expenses, offset by an increase in professional services.  Stock-based compensation for the fiscal year 2015 is $73,300 as compared to zero for fiscal year 2014.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $160,500 related to an injection well located on the Deer Creek property.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company met with State of Colorado officials regarding the injection well permit and due to the length of time the process was taking and the uncertainty of a positive outcome, decided to record the impairment charge.           9            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES       Operating Loss  Operating Loss for the year ended June 30, 2015 was ($1,173,800), an increase of $96,600, or 9%, compared to an Operating Loss of ($1,077,200) reported for the prior year.  The increased operating loss resulted from an increase in revenues offset by an increase in cost of revenues, resulting in a gross loss, offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014.    Other Income and Expense  Interest income for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $41,500, an improvement of $4,000 when compared to interest income of $37,500 for the year ended June 30, 2014.  The increase in interest income related to the increase in the outstanding amount of the note receivable and the increase in the interest rate effective during the current fiscal year.    During fiscal year 2014, the Company recorded a gain of $121,700 on the settlement of the fuel sensor escrow and working capital adjustment related to the sales of its StarTrak subsidiary in fiscal 2011 to ORBCOMM.  During the fiscal year 2015, the Company recorded a gain of $103,200 on the sale of 85,000 shares of ORBCOMM Common Stock at an average selling price of $6.38 as compared to the prior fiscal year which had a gain of $913,800 on the sale of 349,192 shares of ORBCOMM Common Stock at an average selling price of $6.08 per share. Finally, the Company had other income during the year ended June 30, 2015 of $128,500 of which $128,300 reflects the reversal of the previously accrued amount related to the TSI lawsuit which was reversed in the appellate court.  During the year ended June 30, 2014, the Company had $102,000 of other expense.  Of this amount, $128,300 was the accrual for the TSI case, offset by other income from the amendment fee negotiated on the note receivable during fiscal 2014.    Net Loss  Net Loss for the year ended June 30, 2015 was ($900,600), an increase of $794,400, or 748%, when compared to the net loss of ($106,200) for the previous year ended June 30, 2014.  The increase in net loss was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit plus the decrease in the gain on sale of investments as compared to the prior year.    Comprehensive Loss  Comprehensive Loss for the year ended June 30, 2015 represents the unrealized change in market value of the Company’s Marketable Securities held compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.  Comprehensive loss for the year ended June 30, 2015 consisted of the net value of two items:  1) the six months ending market value reclassification adjustment for gain included in Net Loss of ($103,200) and 2) the net unrealized loss on marketable securities sold during the period of ($18,000).  As of December 31, 2014 the Company had sold all shares of ORBCOMM, Inc. Common Stock.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    The Company’s current assets exceeded its current liabilities by $670,600 at June 30, 2015, representing a current ratio of 2.7 to 1.  At June 30, 2014 the Company's current assets exceeded current liabilities by $2,066,400 and reflected a current ratio of 7.3 to 1.  The decrease in current ratio at June 30, 2015 versus June 30, 2014 resulted primarily from the sale of marketable securities, proceeds of which were primarily used to fund operating losses.    Net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was ($667,500) compared with net cash used in operating activities for the prior fiscal year of ($769,700).  The decrease of $102,200 resulted primarily from a $810,600 decrease in the gain on marketable securities offset by the increase in net loss of $794,400.    Consolidated receivables at June 30, 2015 were $50,100 compared to receivables at June 30, 2014 of $106,000.  The receivables at June 30, 2015 relate to $45,900 of trade receivables for AES plus $4,200 of receivables from American Citizenship Center, LLC (“ACC”), a related party.  The receivable at June 30, 2014 relate to $96,800 of trade receivables for AES plus $9,200 of receivables from ACC.    Net cash provided by investing activities during the current year was $261,600, a decrease of $1,053,400 compared to net cash provided by investing activities in the prior year of $1,315,000.   The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $1,581,900 plus an increase in capital expenditures of $230,500, offset by a decrease in expenditures for payments pursuant to the StarTrak sale of $643,800.           10            ALANCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES       Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 amounted to ($20,800), a decrease of $5,300 compared to net cash used in financing activities of ($26,100) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.  The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the purchase of treasury shares.    At June 30, 2015, the Company had zero remaining shares of ORBCOMM Inc.  At June 30, 2014, the Company reported Marketable Securities that consisted of 85,000 shares of ORBCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ: ORBC) Common Stock, valued at approximately $560,100, or $6.59 per share.  The shares were received as part of the Company’s asset sale of its StarTrak Systems, LLC subsidiary in May 2011.  At June 30, 2014, these available for sale securities were valued using a Level 1 fair value measurement based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets which is more fully described in Note 1 – Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements.    The Company has made a significant investment through June 30, 2015 in Alanco Energy Services, Inc. investing approximately $1.6 million in land and $2.7 million in evaporation ponds and equipment for the Deer Creek water disposal site.    The Company has a note receivable from ACC, which was established to provide ACC working capital.  As of June 30, 2015, the note has an outstanding balance of $322,800.  The note is secured by all assets of ACC and bears interest at the rate of 9.5% per annum.  Under the agreement and amendments thereto, the Company was issued a total of 300,000 warrants to purchase membership units of ACC at an exercise price of $1.00 per unit.  The expiration date of the warrants is August 31, 2016 and the value of said warrants is considered immaterial at both June 30, 2015 and 2014 due to the startup nature of ACC and the premium exercise price compared to the most recent membership unit sales, therefore, no value has been recorded for these warrants.    The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  As discussed in Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company’s fiscal 2016 operating plan contemplates development of the AES Indian Mesa site.  In order to develop the Indian Mesa site, the Company will need additional financing which may be in the form of public or private debt or equity financing, or both.  Management cannot assure that it will secure additional financing in order to achieve projections.  If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company’s business, operating results, financial condition and ability to continue operations may be materially adversely affected.   Management has historically been successful in obtaining financing and has demonstrated the ability to implement a number of cost-cutting initiatives to reduce working capital needs or the Company may seek to sell assets.  Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate and do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  As a result, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 discussing the substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
