ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (a)(1)  Liquidity and Capital Resources.       The Company's working capital as of June 30, 1995, was $2,451,520.  A decrease from the prior year of $979,604.  This represents a reduction in the current ratio from 5.0:1 to 3.76:1.  The change in working capital was primarily due to cash used by operations of $1,831,642 and additions to plant property and equipment of $410,550 offset by the proceeds from the sale of the corporate office of $603,500.       As a result of entering the restaurant equipment and supply industry, the Company had 236 Perfect Fry 686 machines, valued at $724,470 added to property, plant and equipment this fiscal year. Of these machines, 150 have been placed in Wal-Mart Stores, which were financed on capitalized leases. The lease balances at fiscal year end were $523,280 with $463,834  included in long term liabilities.  Future additions of capital equipment in this industry segment may utilize the availability of lease financing, which management believes is available.       For additional information regarding liquidity and capital resources please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, specifically Notes 16, 17, 22, and 23.  (a)(2)  Results of Operations (a)(2)  (a) Fiscal 1995 compared to fiscal 1994       Consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 1995, were $3,438,183.  An increase of $1,856,668 or 117.4%.  The manufacturing operations accounted for 91% of this increase.  The balance of the increase was principally due to the new business segments added, restaurant equipment and supply and insurance adjusting.  Since the new business segments were consolidated for a two month period only,  significant increases in revenue are anticipated for the upcoming year (See Note 25 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).       For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995, the Company's net loss increased by $913,415 (23.79%) over the prior fiscal year.  Net losses include the operations of newly added subsidiaries for a two month period only.  The consolidated results also contain extraordinary losses of  $2,321, 449 for fiscal 1995 compared to extraordinary losses of $453,080 for the prior year.  The extraordinary losses more than account for the increase in net losses for the year.  Losses before extraordinary items decreased by $954,954. This decrease is attributable to an increase in manufacturing revenues and a decrease in mining expenditures.       Table F sets forth a breakdown by segments of the Company's business, in the form of a comparison of net income (losses):                               TABLE F                        For the year ended          Category            June 30,     June 30,    Increase       %                 1995         1994   (Decrease)  Change  Environmental     (   162,753)  (1,542,165)  1,379,412     89.45 Restaurant         3,972       N/A       3,972     - Insurance             105,926       N/A        105,926       - Mining       (   195,446)  (  479,646)    284,200     59.25 Manufacturing         425,278   (  344,414)    769,692    123.48 G & A & Other  ( 4,930,356)  (1,473,739) (3,456,617) 134.55  Net Income   (Loss)      (4,753,379)   (3,839,964) (   913,415)   23.79      Table G sets forth a breakdown by segments of the Company's business, in the form of a comparison of operating expenses:                                   TABLE G                        For the year ended          Category            June 30,     June 30,    Increase       %                  1995         1994  (Decrease)    Change  Environmental         269,753    1,647,165   (1,377,412)  (83.62) Restaurant        22,065         N/A        22,065      - Insurance           74,252       N/A        74,252      - Mining           205,446     480,646    (  275,200)   (57.26) Manufacturing       2,644,495   1,719,046       925,449     53.84 G & A          2,711,652     888,642     1,823,010    105.15 Other              -         226,560    (  226,560)  (100.00)  Totals         5,927,663   4,962,059       965,604     19.46      The decrease in the amount of operating expenses of the environmental services is directly related to a reduction in the required research and development costs and the amount of corporate overhead allocated to this business segment as a result of entering into two (2) new segments this year.  Operating expenses for the restaurant equipment and supply and insurance operations were included from May 1, 1995.  Direct service in the mining industry decreased by $275,200, most of which is attributable to a reduction in delay rental fees due the Bureau of Land Management and a watchman's contract for services at one of the Company's mine sites. Direct service expenses for the manufacturing division increased by $925,449 or 54%.  This is a result of a full years operating history versus the six months consolidated the previous year. The increase in general and administrative expenses can be attributed to the inclusion of two new business segments, increased volumes in the manufacturing and the distribution of resources from the environmental segment direct service.     For the year ended June 30, 1995, the Company had significant items that were listed as extraordinary. These items are of a singular nature and would not be considered a part of ongoing operations.  Extraordinary items consisted of a write down of marketable securities of $431,000, a reevaluation of the Boone, Iowa manufacturing plant of $713,000, a write off of mining claims of $598,000, and a loss from sale of the corporate office building of $666,000.  (a)(2) (b) Fiscal 1994 Compared to Fiscal 1993     In fiscal 1994, the Company's net loss decreased by $262,209 (6.39%) over the same period last year. This decrease is attributable to a substantial decrease in costs in the mining industry which outweighed the increased costs in the environmental industry.

This has increased staff.     The increase in operating expenses for the environmental segment of business is attributable to engineering expenses associated with the new design, research and development expenditures and marketing.     The decrease in operating expenses for the mining segment of business is attributable to only one minor write-down taken this year on the valuation of a property and no acquisition expenses. The total dollar amount attributed to these items during the year ended June 30, 1993 was $2,700,908. If this was factored out, operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 1993 would be $131,093 versus $312,435 for the year ended June 30, 1994.      This is an increase of $181,432, which is mostly attributed to the rental fees paid to the Bureau of Land Management on the mineral properties. These fees, recently approved by Congress, were for two years. One year paid in arrears and one year paid in advance. In coming years the fee will be paid in advance only.     In miscellaneous operating expenses, the major item was a loss incurred in the manufacturing segment on the sale of a product line which the Company would no longer represent. This loss was from the sale of inventory and is of a non-reoccurring nature.     The Company recorded $1,581,515 in revenues during the year ended June 30, 1994 of which $1,374,632 was in the recently acquired manufacturing segment of business, which means revenues from ongoing business were actually $206,883. These revenues represent an increase of $195,896 (1,782.98%) over the same period last year. This increase is composed of the following components: i.) an increase in corporate revenue of $100,883 (100%) from sublease rentals of office space and warehouse space; ii.) an increase in environmental revenues of $105,000 (100%) associated with the contract in process at Prescott Valley, Arizona and iii) a decrease in mining revenues of $2,000 (66.67%).
