ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ON FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS      OF OPERATIONS  Results of Operations  Fiscal 1998 Compared to Fiscal 1997       Consolidated revenues for fiscal year 1998 increased 59% to $10,976,000, or an increase of $4,072,000 over fiscal year 1997.  The Restaurant Equipment/Food Service Products segment, Fry Guy Inc., accounted for 55% or $2,224,000 of the increase.  The Company had revenue increases of over $1,848,000 in its pollution control segment, of which CDSI system sales represented an increase of approximately $900,000.       Direct service and cost of goods sold for fiscal year 1998 increased $1,617,000 or 46% over fiscal year 1997 due primarily to costs associated with increased sales in all the Company's business segments.  Selling, general and administrative expenses remained flat because increases in sales expense were offset by reductions in administrative overhead.       For the fiscal year 1998 the Company incurred non-cash charges for impairment of certain assets.  The charges are recorded in the operating expense section of the statement of operations.  These charges were necessary to properly reflect a deterioration of the Company's food business due to termination of Wal-Mart's food service contract with Fry Guy, which accounted for approximately 45% of the consolidated fiscal 1998 revenue.  The contract termination resulted in a write-down of related goodwill of $3,658,000, an additional write-down of $1,500,000 against Fry Guy deep fryer units that Wal- Mart is returning to the Company and a $100,000 restructuring charge.       Consolidated loss from operations, before other income and expenses, was   $4,581,000 compared to a loss of $1,555,000 for the prior year.  The current loss from operations includes non-cash charges for impaired assets in the amount of $5,258,000 related to the loss of the Wal-Mart contract.       The net loss for fiscal year ended June 30, 1998 was $6,655,000 or $1.32 per share, compared to $7,107,000 or $1.45 per share reported in the prior year.       Relative to the Company's mining properties, which continued to be categorized as "assets held for sale", continuing deflation in precious metals markets has further impacted the marketability and valuation of these assets.  Therefore, an additional write-down of $1,800,000 was taken on the mining properties to reflect management's estimated value for these assets of $2,443,000 at June 30, 1998.       Cash flow from continuing operating activities for current fiscal year end was a positive $1,801,000.  This is an improvement of $3,034,000 over the prior comparable period.       Any new Statements of the Financial Accounting Standards affecting the Company are disclosed in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" on page F-10.   Fiscal 1997 Compared to Fiscal 1996       Consolidated revenues for fiscal year 1997 increased 83% or $3,135,000 over fiscal year 1996.  Effective June 30, 1997, the insurance business segment was shut down and all prior years have been restated for comparative purposes.  The food service segment, Fry Guy Inc., accounted for 86% of the increase in                                        12   revenue as the Wal-Mart food program developed rapidly during 1997.  Revenue in the pollution control segment increased 13% during the year.       Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $531,000 or 15% over the prior year.  Seventy-four percent of the increase was in the food service segment and reflects expenses associated with sales growth.  The balance of the increase was in the pollution control segment and reflects additional sales and marketing efforts.       Consolidated loss from operations, before other income and expenses, was $1,555,000.  This was an improvement of $1,441,000 over the prior year's loss.   This gain can be directly attributed to the success of the Fry Guy food program, which was not fully implemented during 1996.       Included under other discontinued operations is a $2,593,000 asset write- down of the Company's mining properties.  This is a book entry necessitated by generally accepted accounting principles and complying with SFAS121 relating to the impairment of assets.  The write-down takes into account the cost of any sale and the time value of future cash flows.  The Company has not given up any mining rights and is not anticipating further reductions.  The Company is still seeking a joint venture or sale of the mining assets.       A decision was made to close the insurance business segment as of June 30, 1997.  This segment reported losses in both years and efforts to improve performance have not been successful.  Management felt the closure would conserve cash and shift resources toward the remaining core businesses.  The operating losses and write-off of the investment are reported under discontinued operations.  All anticipated expenses associated with the closure have been accrued in the 1997 statements.       Cash flow from continuing operating activities for current fiscal year end was a negative $1,233,000.  This is an improvement of $1,573,000 over the prior comparable period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       At June 30, 1998, the Company's current assets exceeded current liabilities by approximately $1,288,000, a current ratio of 1.6 to 1.  At June 30, 1997, the Company's current assets exceeded current liabilities by approximately $1,083,000 and reflected a current ratio of 1.5 to 1.  The current ratio improved, compared to the prior year end, due to a $285,000 increase in current assets, while current liabilities remained relatively constant.  Current assets increased due to increased cash balances from increased sales, without a related increase in accounts receivable, and reduced prepaid expenses.        Net cash provided (used) in operating activities in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $1,573,300, ($1,589,700) and ($3,027,000), respectively.  The major provider of cash for the current fiscal year was the improved operating results, before the non-charges for impairment of assets, resulting from increased operating revenues while reducing administrative overhead expenses.  In fiscal years 1997 and 1996, cash was used in operating activities due primarily to operating losses from continuing operations.       The Company's cash position has improved to $1,116,900 at the end of the current fiscal year from $526,900 in fiscal year 1997 and $552,000 in fiscal year 1996.                                         13        Cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and investment in intangible assets has continued to decrease over the three year period ended June 30, 1998, to $185,300 for the current year from $370,200 in fiscal year 1997 and $312,700 in fiscal year 1996.  The balance of activity relating to cash flow from investing activity during the three year period related to the collection and advance of notes receivable.       Cash provided by (used in) financing activity changed dramatically over the three year period.  In fiscal year 1998, the Company used cash in financing activity of $882,900 primarily to meet current capital lease obligations.  In fiscal years 1997 and 1996, the Company issued additional stock to finance cash operating losses.       During fiscal year 1998, Wal-Mart, which accounted for approximately 45% of the Company's revenue, terminated its contract with the Fry Guy food service operations and is returning over 1,500 fryers to the Company.  Although there will be continued Fry Guy sales to Wal-Mart through the first 1999 fiscal quarter, the Company anticipates the Wal-Mart revenue to cease in the second quarter.  Wal-Mart elected to purchase new fryer equipment for its stores and self-manage the finger food program.        To respond to the contract loss, the Company is quickly revitalizing its sales program to replace declining revenues and is attempting to reduce operating expenses.  The loss of the Wal-Mart account is projected to result in a shortfall in working capital and impair the ability of the Company to meet its short-term capital lease obligations.  The Company believes this working capital shortfall will be resolved by additional borrowing, placement of the fryers in new locations, and sale or lease of the fryers.  The Year 2000 Issue       The Company has consulted with an outside Management Information Systems analyst and determined that all computer systems currently in use by the Company are either in compliance with the Year 2000 issue or can be made to comply with minor modifications.       The Company does not anticipate significant problems with any of its suppliers of data necessary for the Company's operations.  The potential risk to the Company concerning the Year 2000 issue appears to be problems that customers may incur and the effect on their ability to pay the Company for services and products.  The Company does not have a formal contingency plan to resolve this issue.  However, due to the Company's diverse customer base, management anticipates the problems should be limited in scope.  Product and Environmental Contingencies       The Company is not aware of any material product or environmental liabilities.
