ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Liquidity and Capital Resources       As of June 30, 1996, the Company's current assets exceeded current liabilities by $3,032,000, a ratio of 4.7 to 1.  This improvement over the prior year is the result of an increase in current assets of $503,000 and a decrease in current liabilities of $197,000.  The Company will continue to need significant capital for equipment purchases and working capital.  Projections indicate a stronger need in the earlier part of the year and less as revenues improve.  Subsequent to year end, the Company (i) issued $1,100,000 of Class A preferred stock to enhance the interim cash position and (ii) received a letter of intent to provide financing for equipment purchases for the Fry Guy program.  The Company plans continued reductions in overhead expenses wherever possible.       Inventories increased by $270,000 since fiscal year end June 30, 1995.  The majority of this increase was the build up in restaurant equipment needed to fulfill contracts in place.  Much of this equipment will be utilized in the Wal-Mart program which calls for the placement of over 1,200 machines.  Deployment of this equipment began in late June, 1996.  The restaurant equipment segment (Fry Guy) is anticipating a significant increase in revenues from utilization of this equipment.  Cooperative promotional funds from several major corporations are available to assure the success of the program with Wal- Mart and related vendors.  The Company is also pursuing additional loan funds to finance the long term equipment needs of the Fry Guy program.  The Company believes financing is currently available.       The insurance adjustment business completed its expansion in Arizona and Florida during the past year utilizing internal cash supplemented with advances from the parent company.  This segment has a strong client base and will continue to grow through its four locations.  With no further expansion and reduced overhead planned, positive cash flow and profits are projected for this business segment.       During the quarter ended June 30, 1996, the Company received cash deposits for the installation of CDSI equipment in China.  Income will be recognized during the quarter ended September 30, 1996.  Additional CDSI sales are expected in the upcoming year.  The Company will continue to solicit sales through its China corporation and independent agents with worldwide sales capabilities.  Potential customers in developing countries have access to funds for the purchase of pollution control equipment through organizations such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, U.S. Export-Import Bank, as well as interested highly developed countries, such as Japan and South Korea.  This business segment is expected to be profitable and produce positive cash flow.       For the past two years the manufacturing business segment has generated the necessary cash flow needed to operate effectively.  This business is typically slow during the winter months.  Management is planning to take the necessary steps to control costs in relation to revenues generated.  At the present time, the assets of this segment are free from any encumbrances and would be available as collateral should the need arise.  Results of Operations                        Fiscal 1996 Compared to Fiscal 1995       Consolidated revenues for fiscal year 1996 were $4,960,000, representing an increase of 44% over fiscal 1995.  The insurance segment and restaurant service, consolidated for a full year, accounted for 66% and 29%, respectively, of the increase in revenues.  Manufacturing revenues, which increased only slightly, accounted for 67% of consolidated revenue.       During 1996, 61% of revenue in the restaurant service segment was  generated from the sale of equipment.  The Company is currently retaining ownership of the equipment, ultimately leading to a significant increase in gross profit.  Regarding the sale of pollution control equipment, the Company has agreements in place, but installation and revenue recognition will not take place until after fiscal year end.  See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional segment information on revenues and results of operations.       For the year ended June 30, 1996, consolidated net loss was $3,528,000 compared to a loss of $4,753,000 in the prior year.  Fiscal year 1995 included significant write downs of assets reported as other expense.  Loss on operations increased by $830,000.  Forty-nine percent (49%) of this increase can be attributed directly to higher depreciation and amortization expense.       Consolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased by $1,636,000.  The following table lists the amount of expense by major categories and percentage of total general and administrative expense for 1996 and 1995.                             1996         1996          1995            1995      Category             Amount     Percentage      Amount        Percentage  Manufacturing           $  884,000       20        $  655,000          24  Insurance                  827,000       19           108,000           4  Restaurant Service         624,000       14           112,000           4  Environmental              522,000       12           301,000          11  Mining                      65,000        2           205,000           8  Corporate and Other      1,445,000       33         1,350,000          49                          ----------     -----       ----------        -----                         $4,367,000      100        $2,731,000         100        The insurance and restaurant service segments, consolidated for a full year, accounted for 44% and 31% of the increase, respectively.  The Company increased its marketing efforts of the CDSI pollution control equipment, thus incurring additional costs over fiscal 1995 of $221,000.  During fiscal year 1996, corporate expenses increased 7%.  Portions of this increase were due  to the establishment of a Public/Shareholder Relations Department and the establishment of an information retrieval system for Fry Guy Inc.                         Fiscal 1995 Compared to Fiscal 1994       Consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 1995, were $3,438,000, an increase of $1,857,000 or 117%.  The manufacturing operations accounted for 91% of this increase.  The balance of the increase was principally due to the new business segments added May 1, 1995:  restaurant equipment and supply, and insurance adjusting.       For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995, the Company's net loss increased by $913,000 (24%) over the prior fiscal year.  Net losses include the operations of newly added subsidiaries for a two month period only.  The consolidated results for fiscal year 1995 include, under the caption of Other Income (Expense), a write down of property of $1,311,000, loss on the sale of a building and furniture of $666,000, and a write down of investment securities of $431,000, compared to similar losses of $841,000 for the prior year.  These items are of a singular nature and would not be considered a part of ongoing operations.  The above items more than account for the increase in net losses for the year.  Loss from operations decreased by $505,000.  This decrease is attributable to an increase in manufacturing revenues and a decrease in mining expenditures.       Consolidated direct service and cost of sales increased by $1,022,000 from fiscal year 1994 to 1995.  Manufacturing cost of goods sold increased by 54% or $925,000.  This was the result of reporting a full year's operating history  versus the six months that were consolidated the previous year.  Resources relating to environmental research and development were more properly reclassed into the marketing and general and administrative category.       Consolidated selling, general and administrative costs increased by $103,000 from fiscal year 1994.  The net increase in general and administrative expenses was attributed to: (i) the addition of two new business segments, (ii) increased volumes in the manufacturing segment due to its inclusion for a full year, and (iii) a reduction in mining expenses of $275,000 principally due to loss fees paid to the Bureau of Land Management.  Product and Environmental Contingencies       The Company is not aware of any material product or environmental liabilities.
