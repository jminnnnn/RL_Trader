Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ---------------------------------------------    The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data, the Financial  Statements of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. and the Notes thereto and the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements of The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership and the Notes thereto.  General Background and Performance Measurement    The Company,  through its interest in and as managing  general partner of TRG, participates in TRG's Managed Businesses.  TRG's Managed Businesses include: (i) wholly owned Taubman Shopping Centers,  development projects for future regional shopping  centers  (Development   Projects)  and  The  Taubman  Company  Limited Partnership (the Manager), (collectively, the Consolidated Businesses); and (ii) Taubman  Shopping   Centers   partially  owned  through  joint  ventures  (Joint Ventures).    TRG consolidates the wholly owned Taubman  Shopping  Centers,  the Development Projects, and the Manager. The Joint Ventures are accounted for under the equity method in TRG's Consolidated Financial Statements.    Certain  aspects  of  the  performance  of the  Managed  Businesses  are  best understood by measuring  their  performance as a whole,  without regard to TRG's ownership interest. For example, mall tenant sales and shopping center occupancy trends fit this  category  and are so analyzed  below.  In  addition,  trends in certain  items of revenue  and  expense  are often best  understood  in the same fashion, and the discussions following take this approach when appropriate. When relevant,  these  items  are  also  discussed  separately  with  regard  to  the Consolidated Businesses and the Joint Ventures.  Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues    Over  the long  term,  the  level of mall  tenant  sales  is the  single  most important  determinant of revenues of the Taubman  Shopping Centers because mall tenants  provide  over 90% of these  revenues  and  because  mall  tenant  sales determine  the  amount  of  rent,  percentage  rent,  and  recoverable  expenses (together,  total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However, levels of mall tenant sales can be  considerably  more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs.    The Company  believes that the ability of tenants to pay  occupancy  costs and earn  profits  over long  periods of time  increases  as sales per  square  foot increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot.    The following table summarizes occupancy costs, excluding utilities,  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales.                                           1994          1995          1996                                          ----          ----          ---- Mall tenant sales (in thousands)   $2,561,555    $2,739,393    $2,827,245 Sales per square foot                     335           346 (1)       365  Minimum rents                            10.2%         10.4%         10.4% Percentage rents                          0.3           0.3           0.3 Expense recoveries                        4.3           4.4           4.5                                          ----          ----          ---- Mall tenant occupancy costs              14.8%         15.1%         15.2%                                          ====          ====          ====  (1) Sales per square foot was $352, excluding Bellevue Center.                                          20      Occupancy    Historically,  average  annual  occupancy for TRG as a whole has been within a narrow band. In the last ten years,  average annual occupancy has ranged between 86.5% and 88.8%.  Rental Rates    As leases have expired in the Taubman Shopping Centers, TRG has generally been able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. In a period of increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In  periods  of  slower  growth or declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason.  However,  Center revenues  nevertheless  increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current  rental  rates that are usually  higher  than the  average  rates for existing leases. The following table contains certain information  regarding per square foot base rent, excluding renewals, at Taubman Shopping Centers that have been owned and open for five years.

(2)  Includes 18 centers owned and open prior to January 1, 1991.    TRG anticipates  that the spread between opening and closing rents will narrow in 1997.  This  statistic is difficult to predict in part because  TRG's leasing policies  and  practices  may result in early  lease  terminations  with  actual average  closing  rents which may vary from the average  rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations. In addition, the opening or closing of large tenant spaces,  which  generally  pay a lower rent per square foot,  can  significantly change the spread in a given year.  Seasonality    The regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall tenant sales  highest in the  fourth  quarter  due to the  Christmas  season,  and with lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and  back-to-school  events.  While  minimum  rents and  recoveries  are generally not subject to seasonal  factors,  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter,  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Accordingly,  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.                                          21        The following  table  summarizes  certain  quarterly  operating data for TRG's Managed Businesses for 1996:                                1st       2nd       3rd      4th                            Quarter   Quarter    Quarter  Quarter    Total                              1996      1996      1996      1996      1996                           --------------------------------------------------                                             (in thousands) Mall tenant sales         $591,677  $617,821  $627,791  $989,956  $2,827,245 Revenues                   129,764   128,497   129,730   138,250     526,241  Occupancy   Average occupancy           87.8%     87.3%     86.8%     87.6%       87.4%   Ending occupancy            87.7%     87.3%     86.8%     88.0%       88.0% Leased space                  89.5%     88.2%     87.6%     89.0%       89.0%    Because the  seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and  recoveries,  mall tenant  occupancy costs (the sum of minimum rents,   percentage  rents  and  expense  recoveries)   relative  to  sales  are considerably  higher in the first  three  quarters  than they are in the  fourth quarter.  The following table summarizes  occupancy costs,  excluding utilities, for mall tenants as a percentage of sales for each quarter of 1996:                                1st       2nd       3rd      4th                            Quarter   Quarter    Quarter  Quarter    Total                              1996      1996      1996      1996      1996                           -------------------------------------------------- Minimum rents                12.3%     11.7%     11.7%      7.6%     10.4% Percentage rents              0.3       0.3       0.3       0.3       0.3 Expense recoveries            5.6       5.0       4.6       3.5       4.5                              ----      ----      ----      ----      ---- Mall tenant occupancy costs  18.2%     17.0%     16.6%     11.4%     15.2%                              ====      ====      ====      ====      ====  Results of Operations  Equity Transactions    In December  1996,  the  Company  purchased  3,048  newly  issued TRG units of partnership  interest with the $75 million proceeds from the Company's  December 1996 offering of 5.97 million  shares of common stock.  TRG bore all expenses of the  Company's  offering  which have been  accounted  for as a reduction  of the proceeds  from TRG's  issuance of units.  TRG used the net  proceeds to pay down short term floating  rate debt and to acquire La Cumbre Plaza (see below).  Also in  December  1996,  the  Company  exchanged  common  shares  for TRG  units  of partnership   interest   newly  issued  under  TRG's   incentive   option  plan. Additionally  in 1996,  TRG  issued  3,096  units  of  partnership  interest  in connection  with the  acquisition  of the  remaining  interest in Fairlane  Town Center (see below). As a result of these transactions,  at December 31, 1996 the Company had 50.7 million shares of common stock  outstanding  and TRG had 69,998 units of partnership interest outstanding, of which the Company owned 36.68%.  Acquisitions and Disposition    The  following  discussion  of  TRG's  acquisitions  contains  forward-looking statements  regarding  the  impact of these  acquisitions  on EBITDA  (EBITDA is defined and described in Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Distributions).  The actual  impact  may  vary  based  on a  variety  of  factors,  including  actual occupancy,  rents achieved and operating expenses of the Centers.  See Note 3 to TRG's   consolidated   financial   statements  for  further  discussion  of  the acquisitions.  Acquisition of La Cumbre Plaza - ------------------------------    In December 1996,  TRG acquired a 100%  leasehold  interest in La Cumbre Plaza (La Cumbre) located in Santa Barbara, California for $22.25 million in cash. The acquisition  was  funded  with  proceeds  from  an  issuance  of  TRG  units  of partnership  interest (see Equity Transactions  above). The operating results of La  Cumbre  have  been  consolidated  in  TRG's  financial  statements  from the acquisition  date.  The  acquisition  had an immaterial  effect on net income in 1996.  The  acquisition  is expected to add EBITDA in excess of $2.8  million in 1997.                                          22      Acquisition of Remaining Interest in Fairlane Town Center - ---------------------------------------------------------    In July 1996, TRG completed  transactions  that resulted in the acquisition of the 75% interest in Fairlane Town Center  (Fairlane)  previously held by a Joint Venture Partner.  In connection with the  transaction,  TRG issued to the former Joint Venture  Partner 3,096 units of  partnership  interest,  exchangeable  for approximately  6.1 million  shares of the Company's  common  stock,  which had a closing  price of $10.75 per share on the day prior to the  issuance  date.  TRG also assumed mortgage debt of approximately $26 million, representing the former Joint  Venture  Partner's  beneficial  interest  in the $34.6  million  mortgage encumbering  the property.  TRG used unsecured debt to fund the repayment of the 9.73% mortgage and the prepayment  penalty of  approximately  $1.2 million.  The operating  results  of  Fairlane  have  been  consolidated  in  TRG's  financial statements  from the acquisition  date.  Prior to the  acquisition  date,  TRG's interest  in  Fairlane  was  accounted  for under the  equity  method as a Joint Venture.  The acquisition is expected to  incrementally  add  approximately  $11 million to EBITDA over the twelve months following the purchase date.  Acquisition of Paseo Nuevo - --------------------------    In June 1996, TRG acquired a 100% leasehold  interest in Paseo Nuevo,  located in Santa  Barbara,  California,  for $37 million in cash. TRG borrowed under its existing lines of credit to fund the acquisition. The operating results of Paseo Nuevo have been consolidated in TRG's financial  statements from the acquisition date.  The  acquisition  had an  immaterial  effect on net  income in 1996.  The acquisition  is  expected  to produce  EBITDA of over $3.7  million in its first twelve months following the purchase date.  Disposition of Bellevue Center - ------------------------------    In  December  1995,  the bank  group  holding  the $99.5  million  nonrecourse mortgage  encumbering  Bellevue  Center  acquired  title to the Center through a nonjudicial  foreclosure  sale.  The mortgage  matured on November 1, 1995.  TRG ceased to recognize  the results of Bellevue  Associates  (Bellevue),  TRG's 60% owned Joint Venture that owned the Center,  as of November 1, 1995.  TRG's share of Bellevue's net loss from operations for 1994 and the ten months ended October 31, 1995, was $1.1 million and $0.7 million,  respectively.  The Company's share of the net loss was $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.    In  1995,  TRG  recognized  an  extraordinary  gain of  $18.9  million  on the extinguishment  of debt and an ordinary gain of $5.0 million on the  disposition of the Center,  which was based on the  carrying  value of TRG's  investment  in Bellevue.  The Company's share of these gains was $6.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively.    Bellevue's  operations,  which included the effect of the below current market mortgage  interest rate of 5.91%,  contributed  in 1994 and the ten months ended October 31, 1995, $1.4 million and $1.1 million,  respectively, to Distributable Cash  Flow  and  for  these  same  periods,   $0.5  million  and  $0.4  million, respectively,  to Funds from Operations  (Distributable Cash Flow and Funds from Operations  are defined and  discussed  in  Liquidity  and Capital  Resources -- Distributions).  Memorial City Mall Lease    In November  1996,  TRG entered into an agreement to lease  Memorial City Mall (Memorial  City), a 1.4 million square foot shopping  center located in Houston, Texas. The lease of this unencumbered property grants TRG the exclusive right to manage,  lease and operate the  property.  TRG has the option to  terminate  the lease  after the third full lease year by paying $2 million to the  lessor.  TRG will use this option period to evaluate the  redevelopment  opportunities of the Center.  As a  development  project,  Memorial  City has been  excluded from all operating  statistics in this report,  and Memorial City's results of operations have been  presented as a net line item in the following  tabular  comparison of TRG's 1996 results of operations to the prior year. Memorial City is expected to have an immaterial effect on EBITDA and net income during the option period.                                          23      Comparison of Fiscal Year 1996 to Fiscal Year 1995  Taubman Centers, Inc.    The  Company  is the  managing  general  partner  of TRG and  shares  in TRG's financial  performance to the extent of its ownership  percentage.  During 1996, the Company's ownership of TRG changed as a result of several  transactions (see Equity  Transactions  above). The Company's average ownership  percentage of TRG was 34.5% for 1996 and 35.1% for  1995.  The  Company's  ownership  in TRG as of December  31, 1996 was 36.68%.  As of December  31,  1996,  the Company had 50.7 million shares outstanding, up from 44.1 million at December 31, 1995.    Equity in income of TRG consists of the Company's $29.1 million  proportionate share of TRG's income before  extraordinary items for 1996 and $28.0 million for 1995.  These  amounts  were  reduced by $7.6 million in 1996 and $8.1 million in 1995,  representing  adjustments arising from the Company's  additional basis in TRG's net assets.  Equity in income of TRG for 1995 includes a $1.8 million gain related to the disposition of Bellevue Center (see  Acquisitions and Disposition above).  Income before  extraordinary  items for 1996 was $20.7 million or $0.47 per share as compared to $19.3 million or $0.44 per share in 1995.    The  Company  recognized  an  extraordinary  item of $(0.4)  million  in 1996, consisting   of  its  share  of  TRG's   extraordinary   item   related  to  the extinguishment of debt. In 1995, the Company recognized  extraordinary  items of $5.8 million consisting of its share of TRG's extraordinary items related to the disposition of Bellevue  Center (see  Acquisitions  and  Disposition  above) and other extinguishment of debt. Net income for 1996 was $20.3 million or $0.46 per share compared to $25.1 million or $0.57 per share in 1995.  TRG  Occupancy and Mall Tenant Sales    Average  occupancy  in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers was 87.4% in 1996 versus 88.0% in 1995. Ending occupancy for the Taubman Shopping Centers at December 31, 1996 was 88.0% versus  89.4% at December 31, 1995.  Leased space at December 31, 1996 was 89.0% compared to 90.6% at the same date in 1995. Average occupancy for 1996 was somewhat  less than the previous  year's level but  comfortably  within TRG's historic range of average annual  occupancy.  TRG expects that it will not achieve year over year increases in average  occupancy before the fourth quarter of 1997.    Total sales for Taubman Shopping Center mall tenants increased in 1996 by 3.2% to $2.83  billion  from $2.74  billion  in 1995.  Tenant  sales per square  foot increased  by 5.2% to $365 in 1996 from $346 in 1995.  Sales per square  foot in 1995 was $352, excluding Bellevue. Mall tenant sales for Centers that were owned and open for all of 1996 and 1995 (which excludes Paseo Nuevo and Bellevue) were $2.81  billion,  a 3.9%  increase  over 1995.  Sales  statistics  for the fourth quarter  of 1996  were  negatively  affected  by new  competition  near  certain Centers.  TRG expects that the effect of the  competition on sales will moderate after the anniversary date of the opening of the competing centers.    Occupancy  and mall  tenant  sales  statistics  for 1996,  other  than  ending occupancy and leased space, do not include La Cumbre.                                          24     Comparison of

Supplemental Information, amounts represent 100%      of the Joint Ventures. Amounts are net of intercompany profits. (2)  The results of operations of Memorial City are presented net in this table.      Memorial City's partial year results are not indicative of future results.      TRG expects that Memorial City's net operating income will approximate the      ground rent payable under the lease for the immediate future.

(3)  EBITDA, TRG's Beneficial Interest Expense and  Distributable  Cash Flow are      defined and  discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Distributions.      EBITDA  for 1995 does not include the gain related to the disposition  of      Bellevue Center. (4)  Distributable  Cash Flow contribution for 1995 has been restated to reflect      NAREIT's  clarified definition of Funds from  Operations (see Liquidity and      Capital Resources -- Distributions).

Minimum rents for 1996 increased $18.8 million, of which $8.7 million was caused by the Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo acquisitions. The results of Fairlane have been  consolidated  in TRG's  results  subsequent to the  acquisition  date (prior to that date  Fairlane  was  accounted  for under the equity  method as a Joint Venture). Minimum rent also increased due to the expansions at Short Hills and Meadowood and tenant rollovers.  The increase in expense recoveries was also primarily  due to the Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo  acquisitions  and  recoveries of increased  maintenance  costs and property taxes. The increase in other revenues of $3.0 million was  primarily  due to  increases  in revenue  from  management, leasing, and development services, rental fees on exterior advertising signs and gains on sales of  peripheral  land,  partially  offset by a  decrease  in lease cancellation revenue.    Total operating  costs  increased $22.1 million,  or 10.7%, to $229.2 million. The  increase in  recoverable  expenses  for 1996 was due to Fairlane  and Paseo Nuevo and to increases in maintenance costs and property taxes,  including those related to the expansion at Short Hills.  Other operating expenses increased due to Fairlane and Paseo  Nuevo,  and an increase in the charge to  operations  for development  pre-construction  reserves.  General  and  administrative  expenses increased  $2.0 million due  primarily to increases in  compensation,  including costs of the new long-term  performance  compensation plan and the allocation of internal  acquisition costs,  travel, and professional fees in 1996, offset by a decrease  resulting  from a $0.8  million  charge  in  1995  for  severance  and termination  benefits.  Interest expense increased $4.7 million due primarily to an increase in debt levels,  including  debt used to finance the  acquisition of Paseo Nuevo and capital  expenditures and the assumption of debt relating to the Fairlane acquisition,  and a decrease in capitalized interest,  partially offset by decreased  interest rates.  The increase in depreciation and amortization was due primarily to the acquisitions of Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo and the expansions at Short Hills and Meadowood.    Revenues  and expenses as  presented  in the  preceding  table differ from the amounts  shown  in  TRG's   consolidated   income   statements  by  the  amounts representing  Memorial City's revenues and expenses,  which are presented in the preceding table as a net amount.  Joint Ventures - --------------    Total revenues for 1996 were $265.3 million,  a $25.8 million or 8.9% decrease from 1995, primarily  representing a $23.8 million decrease caused by the change in Fairlane from a Joint Venture to a Consolidated  Business and by the November 1995  disposition  of  Bellevue.  Minimum  rent  decreases  due to Fairlane  and Bellevue  were offset by increases  due to the expansion at Woodfield and tenant rollovers.  Expense recoveries decreased primarily due to Fairlane and Bellevue, offset by increases at other  Centers.  Other income  decreased due to a gain on the sale of  peripheral  land in 1995 and  decreased  interest  income  in 1996, offset by an increase in lease cancellation revenue in 1996.    Total operating  costs decreased by $12.7 million,  or 6.9%, to $171.1 million for 1996,  representing  a $19.9 million  decrease due to Fairlane and Bellevue, offset by  increases  at other  Centers.  Recoverable  expenses  decreased  $6.4 million due to Fairlane and Bellevue,  offset by increases in maintenance  costs and property taxes.  Other  operating  costs  increased $0.5 million  reflecting increases in property  management  costs,  promotion and advertising  costs, bad debt expense and a nonrecurring  $0.5 million payment to an anchor at one of the Centers,  offset by decreases  due to Bellevue and  Fairlane.  Interest  expense decreased  $5.1  million  due to a  decrease  in debt  related to  Fairlane  and Bellevue and an increase in capitalized interest,  partially offset by increases due to an increase in debt used to finance  capital  expenditures  and to higher interest rates on certain debt refinanced in 1995.  Operating costs as presented in the preceding table differ from the amounts shown in the combined, summarized financial  statements  of the  unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  (Note 4 to TRG's financial statements) by the amount of intercompany profit.                                          26        As a result of the foregoing,  income before  extraordinary items of the Joint Ventures was $94.3 million in 1996, a decrease of 12.1% from 1995.  TRG's equity in income  before  extraordinary  items of the  Joint  Ventures  decreased  $5.7 million, or 9.8%, to $52.2 million for 1996.  Net Income - ----------    As a  result  of  the  foregoing,  TRG's  income  before  extraordinary  items increased by $4.4 million,  or 5.5%,  to $84.1  million for 1996.  In 1996,  TRG recognized a $(1.3)  million  extraordinary  charge related to the prepayment of Fairlane's  debt. In 1995,  TRG recognized an $18.9 million  extraordinary  gain related to the  disposition  of  Bellevue  and $(2.2)  million in  extraordinary charges  related  to the  prepayment  of  debt  at TRG  and at one of its  Joint Ventures.  Net income for 1996 was $82.8  million,  compared to $96.3 million in 1995.  Comparison of Fiscal Year 1995 to Fiscal Year 1994  Taubman Centers, Inc.    The acquisition of Biltmore Fashion Park (Biltmore) in December 1994, resulted in the Company's ownership percentage of TRG changing from 35.97% to 35.10% (see TRG -- Consolidated Businesses below).    Equity in income of TRG consists of the Company's $28.0 million  proportionate share of TRG's income before  extraordinary items for 1995 and $26.0 million for 1994.  These  amounts  were  reduced by $8.1 million in 1995 and $8.3 million in 1994,  representing  adjustments arising from the Company's  additional basis in TRG's net assets.  Equity in income of TRG for 1995 includes a $1.8 million gain related to the disposition of Bellevue.  Income before  extraordinary  items for 1995 was $19.3  million or $0.44 per share as compared to $17.0 million or $0.38 per share in 1994.    The Company recognized extraordinary items of $5.8 million in 1995, consisting of its share of TRG's extraordinary items related to the disposition of Bellevue and other extinguishment of debt. In 1994, the Company recognized  extraordinary charges  of  $(16.1)   million,   representing  the  Company's  share  of  TRG's extraordinary charges related to the extinguishment of debt. Net income for 1995 was $25.1  million or $0.57 per share  compared  to $927  thousand  or $0.02 per share in 1994.  TRG  Occupancy and Mall Tenant Sales    Average  occupancy  in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers was 88.0% in 1995 versus 86.6% in 1994. Ending occupancy for the Taubman Shopping Centers at December 31, 1995 was 89.4% versus  89.3% at December 31, 1994.  Leased space at December 31, 1995 was 90.6% compared to 90.9% at the same date in 1994.    Occupancy rates increased in part due to a change in the method of calculating occupancy  statistics to be consistent  with  International  Council of Shopping Centers guidelines. The change increased reported average occupancy for the year by  approximately  one percent.  The acquisition of Biltmore also contributed to the increases.    Total sales for Taubman  Shopping  Centers mall  tenants  increased in 1995 by 6.9% to $2.74 billion from $2.56  billion in 1994.  Tenant sales per square foot increased  by 3.3% to $346 in 1995 from $335 in 1994.  Tenant  sales per  square foot reached  $352 in 1995,  excluding  Bellevue.  Mall tenant sales for Centers that were owned and open for all of 1995 and 1994 (which  excludes  Bellevue and Biltmore) were $2.61 billion, a 4.0% increase over 1994.                                          27      Comparison of Fiscal Year 1995 to Fiscal Year 1994    The following table sets forth operating results for TRG's Managed  Businesses for 1994 and 1995, showing the results of the Consolidated  Businesses and Joint Ventures:                                                         1994                                       1995                                  -----------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------                                            TRG                     TOTAL:             TRG                     TOTAL:                                   CONSOLIDATED       JOINT       MANAGED     CONSOLIDATED       JOINT        MANAGED                                     BUSINESSES    VENTURES(1)  BUSINESSES      BUSINESSES    VENTURES(1)  BUSINESSES                                  -----------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------                                                                 (in millions of dollars)              REVENUES:   Minimum rents                          111.3        157.4         268.7          130.4         166.2         296.6   Percentage rents                         3.8          4.8           8.6            5.6           3.6           9.2   Expense recoveries                      68.1         96.7         164.8           75.3         101.5         176.8   Other                                   13.9          9.9          23.8           17.6          11.5          29.1   Gain on disposition of Bellevue                                                                  8.3           8.3                                          -----        -----         -----          -----         -----         ----- Total revenues                           197.1        268.8         465.9          228.9         291.1         520.0  OPERATING COSTS:   Recoverable expenses                    58.4         83.5         141.9           62.9          88.2         151.1   Other operating                         21.0         15.6          36.6           22.5          12.3          34.8   Management, leasing and        development                          3.5                        3.5            3.7                         3.7   General and administrative              17.9                       17.9           19.8                        19.8   Interest expense                        47.7         52.3         100.0           65.8          58.6         124.4   Depreciation and amortization           27.7         23.5          51.2           32.4          24.7          57.1                                          -----        -----         -----          -----         -----         ----- Total operating costs                    176.2        174.9         351.1          207.1         183.8         390.9                                           20.9         93.9         114.8           21.8         107.3         129.1                                                       =====         =====                        =====         ===== Equity in income before extraordinary   items of Joint Ventures (including    $5.0 million in 1995 related to the   disposition of Bellevue)                51.3                                      57.9                                          -----                                     ----- Income before extraordinary items         72.2                                      79.7 Extraordinary items                      (44.7)                                     16.6                                          -----                                     ----- NET INCOME                                27.5                                      96.3                                          =====                                     =====  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION(2)    EBITDA contribution                     96.3         90.3         186.6          120.0          96.1         216.1   TRG's Beneficial Interest Expense      (47.7)       (26.6)        (74.3)         (65.8)        (30.4)        (96.2)   Non-real estate depreciation                                                      (2.0)                       (2.0)                                          -----        -----         -----          -----         -----         -----   Distributable Cash Flow     contribution(3)                       48.6         63.7         112.3           52.1          65.7         117.8                                          =====        =====         =====          =====         =====         =====   (1)  With the exception of the Supplemental Information, amounts represent 100%      of the Joint Ventures.

TRG  borrowed  $81.5  million  to fund the cash  portion of the purchase  price.  The operating  results of Biltmore have been  consolidated  in TRG's financial  statements  from the  acquisition  date. The acquisition had an immaterial effect on net income in 1994 and 1995.    Total revenues for 1995 were $228.9 million, a $31.8 million or 16.1% increase from 1994,  of which $13.7  million was due to Biltmore.  Minimum rents for 1995 increased   $19.1   million,   of  which  $7.8  million  was  due  to  Biltmore. Additionally,  minimum  rents  increased  because  of tenant  rollovers  and the expansion at Short Hills.  The increase in percentage  rent was due primarily to Biltmore.  The increase in expense  recoveries was caused by higher  recoverable expenses  and  Biltmore.   Other  income   increased   primarily  due  to  lease cancellation income, interest income, and insurance recoveries.    Total  operating  costs increased by $30.9 million or 17.5%, to $207.1 million for 1995,  of which  $4.7  million  was due to  Biltmore's  operating  expenses, excluding interest and depreciation and amortization.  The $4.5 million increase in recoverable  expenses for 1995 was primarily due to Biltmore and increases in property  taxes and  maintenance  costs.  General  and  administrative  expenses increased by $1.9 million,  primarily due to a $0.8 million charge for severance and  termination  benefits and increases in  professional  fees and office rent. Interest  expense  for 1995  increased  by  $18.1  million  primarily  due to an increase  in debt  levels,  including  debt used to finance the  acquisition  of Biltmore  and  capital  expenditures,   and  to  increases  in  interest  rates. Depreciation and amortization  also increased,  primarily due to the acquisition of Biltmore and the expansion at Short Hills.  Joint Ventures - --------------    Total revenues for 1995 were $291.1 million,  a $22.3 million or 8.3% increase from  1994,  of  which  $8.3  million  was due to a gain on the  disposition  of Bellevue.  The increase in minimum rents was caused by tenant  rollovers and the expansions  at  Woodfield  and Cherry  Creek,  offset by an  approximately  $1.4 million decrease due to Bellevue.  The increase in expense recoveries was due to the increase in recoverable  expenses.  Other income increased  primarily due to lease cancellation  income and interest income. The $8.3 million gain related to the disposition of Bellevue represents the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the Center (net of accumulated  intercompany profit). As a result,  this  amount  differs  from the  amount  included  in  revenues  in the combined,  summarized  financial statements of the unconsolidated Joint Ventures (Note 4 to TRG's financial statements).    Total operating  costs  increased by $8.9 million,  or 5.1%, to $183.8 million for  1995.  Recoverable  expenses  increased  $4.7  million,  primarily  due  to increases in property taxes and maintenance  costs.  Interest expense  increased $6.3  million,  primarily  due to  increased  debt  levels and  interest  rates. Operating  costs as  presented  in the  preceding  table differ from the amounts shown in the combined,  summarized  financial  statements of the  unconsolidated Joint  Ventures  (Note  4 to  TRG's  financial  statements)  by  the  amount  of intercompany profit.    As a result of the foregoing,  income before  extraordinary items of the Joint Ventures  was $107.3  million in 1995,  an  increase  of 14.3% from 1994.  TRG's equity in income  before  extraordinary  items of the Joint  Ventures  was $57.9 million in 1995, an increase of 12.9% from 1994.                                          29      Net Income - ----------    As a result of the foregoing, TRG's income before extraordinary items for 1995 increased by $7.5 million,  or 10.4%, to $79.7 million.  In 1995, TRG recognized an $18.9 million  extraordinary  gain related to the  extinguishment  of debt at Bellevue and $(2.2) million in  extraordinary  charges related to the prepayment of debt at TRG and at one of its Joint  Ventures.  TRG also  recognized  $(44.7) million in  extraordinary  charges in 1994,  consisting  primarily of prepayment penalties,  related to the  extinguishment of debt. Net income in 1995 was $96.3 million, compared to $27.5 million in 1994.                                                    30      Liquidity and Capital Resources  Taubman Centers, Inc.    As of December 31, 1996,  the Company had a cash balance of $9.4 million,  the source  of  which  was  primarily  TRG's  distributions,  and  had  incurred  no indebtedness.  During 1996 and 1995, the Company received distributions from TRG of $41.3  million and $40.8  million,  respectively.  On December 10, 1996,  the Company declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.23 per common share payable January 20, 1997 to shareholders of record December 31, 1996.    The Company pays regular quarterly dividends to its shareowners. The Company's ability to pay dividends is affected by several factors,  most importantly,  the receipt of distributions  from TRG (see Distributions  below).  Dividends by the Company are at the  discretion  of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash available  to  the  Company,   its  financial   condition,   capital  and  other requirements, and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.    Dividends  declared  totaled  $0.89 per common  share in 1996,  of which $0.41 represented return of capital and $0.48 represented ordinary income, compared to dividends declared in 1995 of $0.88 per common share, of which $0.52 represented return of capital and $0.36 represented ordinary income. The tax status of total 1997 dividends declared and to be declared, assuming continuation of a $0.23 per common share quarterly dividend,  is estimated to be approximately 35% return of capital,  and  approximately  65% of ordinary income.  This is a forward-looking statement  and certain  significant  factors  could cause the actual  results to differ materially, including: 1) the amount of dividends declared; 2) changes in the  Company's  share of  anticipated  taxable  income of TRG due to the  actual results of TRG; 3) changes in the number of the Company's outstanding shares; 4) property  acquisitions or  dispositions;  5) financing  transactions,  including refinancing of existing debt; and 6) changes in the Internal Revenue Code or its application.    In December 1996, the Company issued 5.97 million shares of common stock under a $250 million equity shelf  registration  statement.  The $75 million  proceeds were used to acquire newly issued units of partnership interest in TRG.    The  Company's  Board of Directors  has  authorized  the purchase of up to 750 thousand shares of the Company's common stock in the open market.  The stock may be  purchased  from  time to time as  market  conditions  warrant.  The  Company purchased 19 thousand shares of its common stock for approximately $0.2 million, 436 thousand shares for approximately $4.2 million, and 36.8 thousand shares for approximately $0.3 million in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  As of December 31, 1996, the Company had purchased a cumulative  total of 491.8 thousand shares of its common stock for  approximately  $4.7 million.  Funding for the purchases was  provided by excess  cash that  otherwise  would have been  invested in cash equivalents.    As of December  31,  1996,  the Company had 50.7  million  shares  outstanding compared to 44.1 million at December 31, 1995.                                          31      TRG    As of December  31,  1996,  TRG had a cash  balance of $7.9  million.  TRG had available  for  general  partnership  purposes  an  unsecured  revolving  credit facility of $200  million,  which was  scheduled to expire in May 1998. In March 1997, TRG completed the  renegotiation  of terms increasing the facility to $300 million,  reducing the current  contractual  interest rate by 60 basis points to LIBOR plus 90 basis points and extending the maturity until March 2000. Included in the credit  facility is a competitive  bid option program which allows TRG to hold auctions,  among the banks  participating  in the facility,  for short term borrowings of up to $150 million.  There were no borrowings  under this facility at December 31, 1996. TRG also has available an unsecured bank line of credit of up to $30 million with  borrowings of $10.1  million at December 31, 1996.  This line expires in August 1998. TRG also has available a secured  commercial  paper facility of up to $75 million,  with  borrowings  of $45 million at December 31, 1996.  Commercial paper is generally sold with a 30 day maturity.  This facility is supported by a line of credit  facility,  which is renewable  quarterly for a twelve month period.    Proceeds from short term  borrowings of $121.2  million  provided  funding for 1996 compared to $67.7 million in 1995. The proceeds in 1996 were used primarily for the $37  million  acquisition  in June  1996 of Paseo  Nuevo  and the  $65.6 million acquisition in July 1996 of the 75% interest in Fairlane previously held by TRG's Joint Venture Partner, and related acquisition costs. Proceeds of $65.6 million  from the  issuance of TRG units of  partnership  interest to the former Joint  Venture  Partner  were used to repay short term  borrowings.  Also during 1996,  proceeds of $81.4  million from the issuance of TRG units of  partnership interest  were used to pay down short term  floating rate debt and for the $22.3 million   acquisition   of  La  Cumbre  (see  Results  of  Operations  -  Equity Transactions and Acquisitions and Disposition).    During 1996, TRG issued $154 million of unsecured  notes under its medium-term note program compared to $133.4 million in 1995. In 1996, the notes were used to pay down TRG's  floating rate bank lines as well as to pay off the $34.6 million mortgage on Fairlane and the related  prepayment  penalty of approximately  $1.2 million, leaving the wholly owned property unencumbered. In 1995, the notes were used to pay down floating rate debt under TRG's revolving  credit  facilities as well as to pay off the $22.6  million  mortgage  securing a wholly owned Center. TRG has issued a total of $287 million of medium-term  notes since the program's inception in 1995 under TRG's $500 million shelf registration statement.    Scheduled  principal payments on installment notes were $793 thousand and $897 thousand in 1996 and 1995, respectively.    At December 31, 1996,  TRG's debt and its  beneficial  interest in the debt of its Joint  Ventures  (excluding  $42.3  million  of capital  lease  obligations) totaled $1,398.4 million. As shown in the following table, there was no unhedged floating  rate debt at December  31, 1996.  Interest  rates shown do not include amortization of debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs. These items are  reported  as  interest  expense  in TRG's  results  of  operations.  In the aggregate,  these costs accounted for 0.37% of the effective rate of interest on TRG's  beneficial  interest  in debt at  December  31,  1996.  Included in TRG's beneficial  interest  in  debt  at  December  31,  1996  is  debt  used  to fund development and expansion costs.  TRG's  beneficial  interest in assets on which interest is being  capitalized  totaled  $157.0 million as of December 31, 1996. TRG's beneficial interest in capitalized interest was $8.9 million for 1996.                                          32                                                Beneficial Interest in Debt                                 ------------------------------------------------                                     Amount    Interest LIBOR  Frequency   LIBOR                                 (In millions   Rate at  Cap   of Rate      at                                  of dollars)  12/31/96  Rate   Resets   12/31/96                                  ----------   --------  ----   ------  ---------  Total beneficial interest   in fixed rate debt             1,113.2(1)    7.55%(2) Floating rate debt hedged via  interest rate caps:     Through July 1997              31.6(3)    6.77 (2)  9.60% Monthly      5.53%     Through January 1998          100.0       6.17 (2)  6.50  Monthly      5.53     Through January 1998           65.0       6.31      6.50  Monthly      5.53     Through July 1998              24.3       6.17 (2)  8.35  Monthly      5.53     Through October 1998           39.3       6.06      6.00  Three Months 5.56     Through October 2001           25.0       6.06      8.55  Monthly      5.53                                 ------- Total beneficial interest  in debt                        1,398.4       7.29 (2)                                 =======  (1) Includes TRG's $100 million  floating rate notes due in November 1997, which     were swapped to a fixed rate of 6.15% until  maturity.  The interest rate on     the  refinancing  of this debt is  hedged  via an  interest rate cap for the     period  November  1997 to December  1998 at a three  month LIBOR cap rate of     6.5%. (2) Denotes weighted average interest rate. (3) This debt is additionally hedged via an interest rate cap for the period      July 1997 through July 2002 at a one month LIBOR cap rate of 9.95%.    TRG's loan  agreements and indenture  contain  various  restrictive  covenants including  limitations  on the amount of secured and unsecured  debt and minimum debt service coverage ratios,  the latter being the most restrictive.  TRG is in compliance with all of such covenants.    In January  1997,  Arizona  Mills,  L.L.C.  closed on a secured  $145  million construction  facility  maturing in 2002.  The loan bears  interest at one month LIBOR plus 1.3%. The loan is hedged until maturity at a one month LIBOR cap rate of 9.5%.  The payment of the  principal  and interest is recourse to each of the owners of Arizona Mills, L.L.C. to the extent of their ownership percentage. TRG owns a 37% interest in Arizona Mills, L.L.C.  Distributions    A  principal  factor  considered  by TRG in  deciding  upon  distributions  to partners is an amount,  which TRG defines as  Distributable  Cash Flow, equal to EBITDA less TRG's Beneficial  Interest Expense and non-real estate  depreciation and  amortization.  This  measure  of  performance  is  influenced  not  only by operations but also by capital structure.  EBITDA is defined as TRG's beneficial interest in revenues,  less operating costs before  interest,  depreciation  and amortization,  meaning  TRG's  pro  rata  share of this  result  for each of the Managed Businesses, after recording appropriate intercompany eliminations. TRG's Beneficial  Interest Expense is defined as 100% of the interest expense of TRG's Consolidated  Businesses and TRG's pro rata share of the interest expense on the debt of the Joint  Ventures.  Funds from  Operations is calculated by adding the Company's  beneficial interest in TRG's Distributable Cash Flow to the Company's other income, less the Company's operating expenses. EBITDA,  Distributable Cash Flow and Funds from Operations do not represent cash flows from  operations,  as defined  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,   and  should  not  be considered  to be an  alternative  to net income as an  indicator  of  operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. However, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) suggests that Funds from Operations is a useful supplemental measure of operating  performance for REITs.                                          33        In March 1995,  NAREIT issued a clarification  of the definition of Funds from Operations.  Beginning in 1996,  the Company  modified its  calculation of Funds from  Operations  and  TRG's  calculation  of  Distributable  Cash  Flow  to  be consistent with NAREIT's  clarified  definition.  As a result,  TRG adjusted the depreciation  and  amortization  amount added back to net income to include only depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely  significant to the real estate industry.  Distributable  Cash Flow and Funds from Operations for 1995 have been restated in the table below to reflect the clarified definition.    The following table summarizes TRG's Distributable Cash Flow and the Company's Funds from Operations for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996:                                                     Year ended                             Year ended                                               December 31, 1995                     December 31, 1996                                     -------------------------------------  -----------------------------------                                               TRG                                   TRG                                      CONSOLIDATED         JOINT            CONSOLIDATED         JOINT                                        BUSINESSES   VENTURES(1)   TOTAL      BUSINESSES   VENTURES(1)   TOTAL                                     ------------------------------------  ------------------------------------                                                                 (in millions of dollars)               TRG's Net Income(2)(3)                                             96.3                                  82.8 Gain on disposition of Bellevue(3)                                 (5.0) Extraordinary items(3)(4)                                         (16.6)                                  1.3 Depreciation and amortization(4)(5)                                45.2                                  47.5 TRG's Beneficial Interest Expense(4)                               96.2                                  98.2                                                                   -----                                 ----- EBITDA                                      120.0       96.1      216.1           138.1       91.7      229.8 TRG's Beneficial Interest Expense(4)        (65.8)     (30.4)     (96.2)          (70.5)     (27.7)     (98.2) Non-real estate depreciation                 (2.0)                 (2.0)           (1.9)                 (1.9)                                             -----      -----      -----           -----      -----      ----- Distributable Cash Flow(6)                   52.1       65.7      117.8            65.7       64.0      129.7                                             =====      =====      =====           =====      =====      =====  TCI's share of Distributable  Cash Flow(6)                                                      41.4                                  44.7 Other income/expenses, net                                         (0.6)                                 (0.6)                                                                   -----                                 ----- Funds from Operations(6)                                           40.8                                  44.1                                                                   =====                                 =====  (1)  Amounts represent TRG's beneficial interest in the operations of its Joint       Ventures. (2)  Includes TRG's share of gains on peripheral land sales of $1.7 million and      $1.0  million in 1995 and 1996, respectively.   (3)  In 1995, TRG recognized an ordinary gain of $5.0 million and an       extraordinary gain of $18.9 million related to the disposition of Bellevue.      Extraordinary charges related to the extinguishment of debt, primarily       consisting of prepayment penalties, were recorded in 1995 and 1996. (4)  Amounts represent TRG's and TRG's beneficial interest in the Joint       Ventures' extraordinary items, depreciation and amortization, and interest      expense. (5)  Includes $3.2 million and $3.3  million  of  amortization  of mall  tenant      allowances in 1995 and 1996, respectively.   (6)  Distributable Cash Flow and Funds from Operations have been restated from      the previously reported amounts for 1995 of $119.9 million and $41.5       million, respectively. (7)  Amounts may not add due to rounding.     For 1996,  EBITDA and  Distributable  Cash Flow were $229.8 million and $129.7 million,  compared to $216.1 million and $117.8 million,  as restated,  in 1995. TRG  distributed  $119.1  million to its  partners  in 1996,  compared to $116.2 million in 1995. The Company's Funds from Operations for 1996 was $44.1 million, compared to $40.8 million, as restated, in 1995.    The Partnership  Committee of TRG makes an annual determination of appropriate distributions   for  each  year.  The  determination  is  based  on  anticipated Distributable  Cash Flow,  as well as  financing  considerations  and such other factors  as  the  Partnership  Committee  considers  appropriate.  Further,  the Partnership  Committee has decided that the growth in distributions will be less than the growth in Distributable Cash Flow for the immediate future.     Except under unusual  circumstances,  TRG's  practice is to  distribute  equal monthly  installments of the determined  amount of distributions  throughout the year.  Due  to  seasonality  and  the  fact  that  cash  available  to  TRG  for distributions  may be  more  or less  than  net  cash  provided  from  operating activities  plus  distributions  from Joint  Ventures  during the year,  TRG may borrow  from  unused  credit  facilities  (described  in  Liquidity  and Capital Resources -- TRG above) to enable it to  distribute  the amount  decided upon by the TRG Partnership Committee.                                          34        Distributions  by each Joint Venture may be made only in  accordance  with the terms of its  partnership  agreement.  TRG acts as the managing  partner in each case and, in general,  has the right to determine  the amount of cash  available for  distribution  from the Joint Venture.  In general,  the provisions of these agreements  require the  distribution  of all available cash (as defined in each partnership agreement), but most do not allow borrowing to finance distributions without approval of the Joint Venture Partner.    As a result,  distribution  policies of many Joint  Ventures will not parallel those of TRG.  While TRG may not,  therefore,  receive as much in  distributions from each Joint Venture as it intends to  distribute  with respect to that Joint Venture,   the  Company  does  not  believe  this  will  impede  TRG's  intended distribution  policy  because  of TRG's  overall  access  to  liquid  resources, including borrowing capacity.    Any inability of TRG or its Joint Ventures to secure  financing as required to fund  maturing  debts,  capital  expenditures  and  changes in working  capital, including development activities and expansions,  may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such  obligations,  thereby possibly  reducing  distributions to partners of TRG and funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends.    In  addition,  if the GM Trusts  exercise  their  rights under the Cash Tender Agreement (see Liquidity and Capital  Resources -- Cash Tender Agreement below), TRG will be  required  to pay the GM  Trusts  $10.9  million  and may  borrow to finance such expenditures.  Capital Spending    Capital  spending for routine  maintenance of the Taubman  Shopping Centers is generally recovered from tenants. Capital spending by the Managed Businesses not recovered from tenants is summarized in the following table:                                                          1995                                     --------------------------------------------                                     Consolidated        Joint     TRG's Share of                                       Businesses  Ventures(1)  Joint Ventures(1)                                     --------------------------------------------                                               (in millions of dollars)  Development, renovation, and expansion:   Existing centers                          33.2         41.7            25.4   New centers                               15.0 Pre-construction development activities,   net of charge to operations                9.8 Mall tenant allowances                       3.5          1.9             1.0 Corporate office improvements                1.5 Other                                        0.3          0.6             0.2                                             ----         ----            ---- Total                                       63.3         44.2            26.6                                             ====         ====            ====                                                            1996                                     --------------------------------------------                                     Consolidated        Joint     TRG's Share of                                       Businesses  Ventures(1)  Joint Ventures(1)                                     --------------------------------------------                                               (in millions of dollars)  Development, renovation, and expansion:   Existing centers                           5.2         40.3            30.5   New centers                                6.6         66.7            27.2 Pre-construction development activities,   net of charge to operations                4.1 Mall tenant allowances                       4.5          5.2             2.5 Corporate office improvements                1.5 Other                                        2.3          1.4             0.8                                             ----        -----            ---- Total                                       24.2        113.6            61.0                                             ====        =====            ====  (1) Costs are net of intercompany profits.                                          35        In 1995 and 1996, TRG's share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased during the year,  excluding expansion space and new developments,  was $7.72 and $9.96,  respectively.  In addition,  TRG's share of its Consolidated Businesses' and Joint Ventures' capitalized leasing costs,  excluding new developments,  was $6.7 million, or $10.40 per square foot leased during the year in 1995, and $8.5 million or $10.47 per square foot leased during the year in 1996.    An expansion  at  Westfarms,  which will open in the summer of 1997,  will add approximately  135,000  square  feet of mall  GLA and  Nordstrom  as an  anchor. Approximately  75% of  this  space  has  been  leased  or  has  leases  out  for signatures.  The expansion is expected to cost  approximately  $100 million.  An expansion at Cherry Creek will include a newly  constructed Lord & Taylor store, which will open in the fall of 1997,  and the addition of 132,000 square feet of mall GLA, which will open in the fall of 1998. The expansion is expected to cost approximately $50 million. TRG has a 79% and 50% ownership interest in Westfarms and Cherry Creek, respectively.    Additionally,  a project is now under  construction  to add over 30,000 square feet of new mall tenant  space in the  building  vacated  when Saks Fifth Avenue moved to the I. Magnin site at Biltmore.  The new stores are presently  expected to open beginning in the spring of 1997. The project is expected to cost between $5 and $10 million.    The Mall at  Tuttle  Crossing,  a 980,000  square  foot  Center  in  northwest Columbus,  Ohio,  will be anchored by Marshall  Field's,  Lazarus,  JCPenney and Sears. TRG is leasing the land and mall buildings from Tuttle Holding Co., which owns the land on which the Center is being  built.  TRG will make ninety  annual minimum lease  payments of $4.4 million  beginning when the Center opens in July 1997. Substantially all of each payment in the first ten years of operation will be recognized as interest  expense.  TRG will also pay additional  rent based on achieved  levels of net  operating  income,  a measure of operating  performance before rent payments,  as specified in the agreement (NOI);  100% of the portion of NOI which is over $11.6 million but less than or equal to $14.4 million,  30% of the portion of NOI between  $14.4 million and $18.3  million,  and 50% of the portion of NOI over $18.3 million.  TRG estimates this  additional  rent,  which will be recognized as other operating expense, will approximate $2 million to $3 million annually  beginning in 1999.  Substantially all of the Center's mall GLA has been  leased.  The Center is expected to cost  approximately  $115  million, including capital lease assets of $55 million.    Arizona Mills, an enclosed value  super-regional  mall in Tempe,  Arizona,  is opening in November 1997. TRG has a 37% ownership interest in Arizona Mills. The 1.2 million square foot  value-oriented  mall is expected to cost  approximately $180 million.    MacArthur Center, a new Center being developed by TRG in Norfolk, Virginia, is expected  to open in the  spring of 1999.  The Center is  expected  to total 1.1 million  square feet and will  initially be anchored by Nordstrom and Dillard's. This Center will be owned by a joint venture in which TRG has a 70% interest and is projected to cost approximately $150 million.    In 1996,  TRG entered  into an agreement  to lease  Memorial  City Mall, a 1.4 million square foot shopping center located in Houston,  Texas. Memorial City is anchored by Sears, Foley's,  Montgomery Ward and Mervyn's. TRG has the option to terminate  the  lease  after the third  full  year by paying $2  million  to the lessor.   TRG  is  using  this  option  period  to  evaluate  the  redevelopment opportunities  of the  Center.  Under the terms of the lease,  TRG has agreed to invest a minimum of $3  million  during the three  year  option  period.  If the redevelopment  proceeds,  TRG is required to invest an additional $22 million in property  expenditures not recoverable from tenants during the first 10 years of the lease term.                                          36        Assuming no acquisitions,  planned capital spending by the Managed  Businesses not recovered from tenants for 1997 is summarized in the following table:                                                          1997                                     --------------------------------------------                                     Consolidated        Joint     TRG's Share of                                       Businesses  Ventures(1)  Joint Ventures(1)                                     --------------------------------------------                                               (in millions of dollars)  Development, renovation, and expansion      61.5 (2)    225.1 (3)       120.3 Mall tenant allowances                       5.8          3.7             2.2 Pre-construction development and   other                                     10.7 (4)      1.0             0.6                                             ----        -----           -----  Total                                       78.0        229.8           123.1                                             ====        =====           =====  (1) Costs are net of intercompany profits. (2) Includes  costs  related  to  leasehold improvements  at The Mall at  Tuttle     Crossing;  excludes  capital lease assets (see Note 9 to TRG's  consolidated     financial statements). (3) Includes  costs related to expansion projects at Westfarms and Cherry Creek.     Also includes construction costs for MacArthur Center and Arizona Mills. (4) Includes  costs to explore the  possibilities  of  building an enclosed  1.7     million square foot value super-regional mall in Auburn Hills, Michigan.     Also includes the costs to evaluate the redevelopment of Memorial  City and     required property expenditures under the terms of the lease.    TRG's share of costs for  development and expansion  projects  scheduled to be completed in 1998 and 1999 is  anticipated  to be as much as $60 million in 1998 and $19 million in 1999.    TRG's   estimates   regarding   capital   expenditures   presented  above  are forward-looking  statements  and  certain  significant  factors  could cause the actual  results to differ  materially,  including  but not limited to: 1) actual results of negotiations with anchors, tenants and contractors; 2) changes in the scope of projects;  3) cost overruns;  4) timing of expenditures;  and 5) actual time to complete projects.  Capital Resources    TRG believes that its net cash provided by operating activities, together with distributions  from the Joint  Ventures,  the  unutilized  portion of its credit facilities  and its ability to generate  cash from the  issuance of  medium-term notes under TRG's shelf registration  statement,  other securities  offerings or mortgage  financings,  assure  adequate  liquidity to conduct its  operations in accordance with its distribution and financing policies.    The financing of TRG is intended to maintain an investment grade credit rating for  TRG  and  (i)  minimize,  to the  extent  practical,  secured  indebtedness encumbering  TRG's wholly owned  properties,  (ii)  mitigate  TRG's  exposure to increases  in  floating  interest  rates,  (iii)  assure that the amount of debt maturing in any future year will not pose a significant  refinancing  risk, (iv) provide for additional capital and liquidity resources, and (v) maintain average maturities  for TRG's  debt  obligations  of between  five and ten years.  TRG's intent to continue to minimize  secured  indebtedness  is  dependent  on actions taken by credit rating agencies and market conditions.    TRG  expects to  finance  its  capital  requirements,  including  development, expansions and working capital,  with available cash, borrowings under its lines of credit and cash from future  securities  offerings under its medium-term note program, other securities offerings,  or mortgage financings.  TRG's acquisition activities are discretionary in nature, and will only be undertaken by TRG after arranging  adequate  financing on terms that are consistent with TRG's financing policies.  TRG's Joint  Ventures  expect to finance  development  and  expansion spending with secured debt to the extent it is available.    TRG's  borrowings are not and will not be recourse to the Company  without its consent.                                          37      Cash Tender Agreement    A. Alfred  Taubman  and the GM Trusts each have the annual  right to tender to the Company units of  partnership  interest in TRG (provided  that the aggregate value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender Agreement).  The Company  will have the option to pay for these  interests  from available  cash,  borrowed  funds,  or from the  proceeds  of an offering of the Company's  common  stock.  Generally,  the  Company  expects  to  finance  these purchases  through the sale of new shares of its stock.  The tendering  partners will  bear all  market  risk if the  market  price at  closing  is less than the purchase  price.  Any proceeds of the  offering in excess of the purchase  price will be for the sole benefit of the Company.  At A. Alfred  Taubman's  election, his family, and Robert C. Larson and his family may participate in tenders.  The GM Trusts will be entitled  to receive  from TRG an amount (not to exceed  $10.9 million in the aggregate over the term of the Partnership)  equal to 5.5% of the amounts that the Company pays to the GM Trusts under the Cash Tender Agreement.    Based on a market  value at  December  31, 1995 and 1996 of $10.00 and $12.875 per common share,  the aggregate  value of interests in TRG that may be tendered under the Cash Tender Agreement was approximately $743 million and $954 million, respectively.  Purchase  of these  interests  at  December  31,  1996 would have resulted in the Company owning an additional 53% interest in TRG.    Although certain partners in TRG have pledged,  and other partners may pledge, their  units of  partnership  interest,  the Company is not aware of any present intention of any partner to sell its interest in TRG.                                          38      Item 8.
