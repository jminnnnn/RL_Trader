Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations  contains various"forward-looking  statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,  and Section 21Eof  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  These  forward-looking   statements  represent  the  Company'sexpectations or beliefs concerning future events,  including the following:  statements  regarding future  developments andjoint  ventures,  rents and returns,  statements  regarding the  continuation of trends,  and any statements  regarding thesufficiency of the Company's  cash balances and cash  generated  from operating and financing  activities for the Company'sfuture  liquidity and capital resource needs. The Company  cautions that although  forward-looking  statements  reflect theCompany's  good faith  beliefs and best  judgment  based upon  current  information,  these  statements  are  qualified  byimportant  factors that could cause  actual  results to differ  materially  from those in the  forward-looking  statements,including  those  risks,  uncertainties,  and  factors  detailed  from time to time in reports  filed with the SEC,  and inparticular those set forth under the headings "General Risks of the Company" and  "Environmental  Matters" in the Company'sAnnual Report on Form 10-K. The following  discussion  should be read in  conjunction  with the  accompanying  ConsolidatedFinancial Statements of Taubman Centers, Inc. and the Notes thereto. General Background and Performance Measurement    The Company owns a managing general  partner's  interest in The Taubman Realty Group Limited  Partnership (the OperatingPartnership or TRG), through which the Company conducts all of its operations.  The Operating  Partnership owns,  develops,acquires, and operates regional shopping centers nationally.  The Consolidated  Businesses consist of shopping centers thatare controlled by ownership or contractual  agreement,  development  projects for future regional shopping centers, and TheTaubman  Company LLC (the  Manager).  Shopping  centers that are not  controlled  and that are owned through joint ventureswith third parties (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.   The operations of the shopping centers are best understood by measuring their performance as a whole,  without regard tothe  Company's  ownership  interest.  Consequently,  in addition to the  discussion of the  operations of the  ConsolidatedBusinesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented and discussed as a whole.   During 2001, the Company opened four new shopping centers (Results of Operations-New  Center Openings).  Also, in August2000, the Company completed a transaction to acquire an additional  interest in one of its  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures;the Operating  Partnership  became the 100% owner of Twelve Oaks Mall and the joint venture  partner  became the 100% ownerof  Lakeside.  Additional  2001 and 2000  statistics  that exclude the new centers and Lakeside are provided to present theperformance of comparable centers. Current Operating Trends    In 2001, the regional shopping center  industry  has  been  affected  by the softening  of  the national economic cycle.Economic pressures that affect consumer confidence, job growth, energy costs, and income  gains  can  affect  retail  salesgrowth and impact the Company's ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates.  A number of regionaland national retailers  have  announced  store closings or filed for bankruptcy. During 2001, 4.5% of the Company's tenantssought the protection of the bankruptcy laws, compared to 2.3% in 2000. The impact of a softening economy  on the Company'scurrent results of operations is  moderated by lease cancellation  income, which  tends to  increase  in down-cycles of theeconomy.   In addition to overall economic  pressures,  the events of September 11 had a negative impact on tenant sales subsequentto  September.  Tenant sales per square foot in the fourth  quarter of 2001  decreased by 3.8%  compared to the same periodin 2000.  Although this was an improvement  from the 9.8% decrease in sales per square foot in the month of September,  thefourth  quarter  decrease was  significantly  greater than the 0.3%  decrease in sales per square foot that the Company hadexperienced  through August 2001. In addition,  fourth quarter  comparable center average  occupancy  declined by 1.7% fromthe prior year.                                                              17   The tragic  events of September 11 will also have an impact on the  Company's  future  insurance  coverage.  The Companypresently  has  coverage  for  terrorist  acts in its  policies  that expire in April 2002.  The Company  expects that suchcoverage will be excluded from its standard property policies at the Company's  renewal.  Based on preliminary  discussionswith its  insurance  agency,  such  coverage  will be  available  as a separate  policy with lower  limits than the presentcoverage, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources-Covenants and Commitments".   Given the state of the insurance  industry  prior to September 11, and the impact of September 11, the Company  believesits premiums,  including the cost of a separate  terrorist  policy,  could increase by over 100% for property  coverage andover 25% for liability  coverage.  These increases would impact the Company's annual common area maintenance  rates paid bythe  Company's  tenants by about 55 cents per square foot.  Total  occupancy  costs paid by tenants  signing  leases in theCompany's traditional centers are on average about $70 per square foot. Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues    Over the long term, the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important  determinant of revenues of the shoppingcenters  because mall tenants  provide  approximately  90% of these  revenues and because mall tenant sales  determine  theamount of rent,  percentage rent, and recoverable  expenses (together,  total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can affordto pay.  However,  levels of mall tenant  sales can be  considerably  more  volatile in the short run than total  occupancycosts.   The Company  believes  that the ability of tenants to pay  occupancy  costs and earn  profits  over long periods of timeincreases as sales per square foot increase,  whether through inflation or real growth in customer  spending.  Because mostmall tenants have certain fixed  expenses,  the occupancy  costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable  are ahigher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot.   The following table summarizes  occupancy costs,  excluding  utilities,  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenantsales.                                                                 2001             2000              1999                                                                 ----             ----              ----      Mall tenant sales (in thousands)                     $2,797,867       $2,717,195        $2,695,645      Sales per square foot                                       456              466(1)            453      Minimum rents                                              10.0%             9.7%              9.7%      Percentage rents                                            0.2              0.3               0.2      Expense recoveries                                          4.5              4.4               4.3                                                                  ---              ---               ---      Mall tenant occupancy costs                                14.7%            14.4%             14.2%                                                                 ====             ====              ====(1)  2000 sales per square foot has been restated to include MacArthur Center, which opened in March 1999.   For the year ended December 31, 2001, for the first time in the Company's history as a public company,  sales per squarefoot  decreased in  comparison  to the prior year,  reflecting  the current  difficult  retail  environment  as well as thedirect  impact of the events of September 11. The negative  sales trend  directly  impacts the amount of  percentage  rentscertain  tenants and anchors  pay. The effects of declines in sales  experienced  during 2001 on the  Company's  operationsare moderated by the relatively  minor share of total rents  (approximately  three  percent)  percentage  rents  represent.However,  if lower levels of sales were to continue,  the  Company's  ability to lease  vacancies  and  negotiate  rents atadvantageous rates could be adversely affected. Rental Rates    As leases have expired in the shopping centers,  the Company has generally been able to rent the available space, eitherto the existing tenant or a new tenant,  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired  leases.  In a period ofincreasing  sales,  rents  on new  leases  will  tend to  rise as  tenants'  expectations  of  future  growth  become  moreoptimistic.  In periods of slower growth or declining sales,  such as the Company is currently  experiencing,  rents on newleases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason.  However,  center revenues  nevertheless  increase asolder leases roll over or are  terminated  early and replaced with new leases  negotiated at current  rental rates that areusually higher than the average rates for existing  leases.  The following  table contains  certain  information  regardingper square foot minimum rent at the shopping centers that have been owned and open for at least two years.                                                           18                                                              2001              2000(1)           1999                                                              ----              ----              ----      Average minimum rent per square foot:         All mall tenants                                      $40.97            $39.77           $39.58         Stores closing during year                             40.76             40.06            39.49         Stores opening during year                             49.58             46.21            48.01(1)  2000 rent per square foot information has been  restated  to  include  MacArthur  Center, which  opened in March 1999.   Generally,  the rent spread  between  opening and closing  stores is in the Company's  historic range of $5.00 to $10.00per square foot.  This statistic is difficult to predict in part because the Company's  leasing  policies and practices mayresult in early lease  terminations  with actual average closing rents per square foot which may vary from the average rentper square foot of scheduled lease expirations. Occupancy    Historically,  annual average  occupancy has been within a narrow band. In the last ten years,  annual average occupancyhas ranged  between  84.9% and 89.4%.  Mall tenant  average  occupancy,  ending  occupancy,  and leased  space rates are asfollows:                                                                 2001             2000              1999                                                                 ----             ----              ----   All Centers   -----------      Average occupancy                                         84.9%             89.1%            89.0%      Ending occupancy                                          84.0              90.5             90.4      Leased space                                              87.7              93.8             92.1   Comparable Centers   ------------------      Average occupancy                                         88.1%             89.3%      Ending occupancy                                          88.8              90.5      Leased space                                              91.8              93.8   The lower occupancy and leased space in 2001 reflect the opening of the four new centers at occupancy  levels lower thanthe average of the existing  portfolio.  A number of unanticipated  early lease terminations  accounted for the majority ofthe decline in comparable center occupancy. Seasonality    The regional  shopping center  industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter dueto the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations  associated with the Easter holidayand back-to-school  events.  While minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors,  most leasesare  scheduled  to expire in the first  quarter,  and the  majority  of new stores  open in the second  half of the year inanticipation of the Christmas  selling  season.  Additionally,  most  percentage  rents are recorded in the fourth quarter.Accordingly, revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.                                               1st            2nd             3rd            4th                                             Quarter        Quarter         Quarter        Quarter          Total                                              2001            2001            2001           2001           2001                                         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                         (in  thousands)  Mall tenant sales                         $570,223       $605,945       $617,805      $1,003,894     $2,797,867  Revenues                                   132,903        137,964        139,640         169,330        579,837  Occupancy:       Average                                87.0%          85.5%          84.0%           83.7%          84.9%       Ending                                 85.1           85.6           83.0            84.0           84.0       Average-comparable (1)                 88.1           87.9           87.6            88.6           88.1       Ending-comparable (1)                  88.4           87.7           87.7            88.8           88.8  Leased space:       All centers                            90.8           90.0           88.0            87.7           87.7       Comparable (1)                         92.4           91.8           91.5            91.8           91.8(1)  Excludes centers that opened in 2001-see Results of Operations-New Center Openings.                                                           19    Because the  seasonality  of sales  contrasts  with the generally  fixed nature of minimum rents and  recoveries,  malltenant  occupancy  costs (the sum of minimum  rents,  percentage  rents,  and  expense  recoveries)  relative  to sales areconsiderably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter.                                                 1st            2nd             3rd            4th                                             Quarter        Quarter         Quarter        Quarter            Total                                                2001           2001            2001           2001             2001                                            -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Minimum rents                                 11.2%          10.5%          11.2%            8.3%          10.0%  Percentage rents                               0.3            0.1            0.1             0.4            0.2  Expense recoveries                             5.0            5.1            4.8             3.6            4.5                                                 ---            ---            ---             ---            ---  Mall tenant occupancy costs                   16.5%          15.7%          16.1%           12.3%          14.7%                                                ====           ====           ====            ====           ==== Results of Operations  New Center Openings    In March 2001, Dolphin Mall, a 1.3 million square foot value regional center, opened in Miami, Florida.  Dolphin Mall isa 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint Venture and is accounted for under the equity method. The Operating  Partnership will beentitled to a preferred  return on approximately  $30 million of equity  contributions as of December 2001, which were usedto fund construction costs.   The Shops at Willow  Bend,  a wholly owned  regional  center,  opened  August 3, 2001 in Plano,  Texas.  The 1.5 millionsquare foot center is anchored by Neiman Marcus,  Saks Fifth Avenue,  Lord & Taylor,  Foley's,  and  Dillard's.  Saks FifthAvenue will open in 2004.   International  Plaza,  a 1.25  million  square foot  regional  center,  opened  September  14,  2001 in Tampa,  Florida.International  Plaza  is  anchored  by  Nordstrom,  Lord &  Taylor,  Dillard's,  and  Neiman  Marcus.  The  Company  has anapproximately  26%  ownership  interest in the center.  However,  because the  Company  provided  approximately  53% of theequity  funding for the project,  the Company  will  receive a  preferential  return.  The Company  expects to be initiallyallocated  approximately  33% of the net operating  income of the project,  with an additional  7%  representing  return ofcapital.  The  Operating  Partnership  will be  entitled  to a  preferred  return on  approximately  $19  million of equitycontributions as of December 2001, which were used to fund construction costs.   The Mall at Wellington Green, a 1.3 million square foot regional center,  opened October 5, 2001 in Wellington,  Floridaand is initially anchored by Lord & Taylor,  Burdines,  Dillard's,  and JCPenney. A fifth anchor,  Nordstrom,  is obligatedunder the  reciprocal  easement  agreement to open within 24 months of the opening of the center and is presently  expectedto open in  2003.  The  center  is owned by a joint  venture  in which  the  Operating  Partnership  has a 90%  controllinginterest.   Although  Dolphin Mall opened on schedule,  the center  encountered  significant  levels of tenant and  landlord-relatedissues arising from the construction  process,  far exceeding those historically  experienced by the Company. The difficultopening resulted in lower than expected  occupancy in 2001. In addition,  lower than anticipated  sales, in part due to theeffect of September 11 on major tourist  areas,  have caused  significant  tenant issues  resulting in early  terminations,lower recoveries, and higher levels of uncollectible receivables.   In addition,  general  economic  conditions have also affected the performance of Willow Bend and to a lesser extent theother two new  centers.  Leased  space as of  December  31,  2001 at the four new  centers  was 75 to 80%,  lower  than theCompany would have previously  expected.  As a result,  the Company  presently  expects that the return on the four centerswill be  under 9% in  2002.  Over  100  additional  stores  remain  to be  leased  at  these  centers  in order to  achievestabilization.  Estimates  regarding returns on projects are  forward-looking  statements and certain  significant  factorscould cause the actual results to differ  materially,  including but not limited to: 1) actual results of negotiations withtenants,  2) timing of tenant openings, and 3) early lease terminations and bankruptcies.                                                           20 Other Transactions    In October 2001, the Operating Partnership committed to a restructuring of its development  operations.  A restructuringcharge of $2.0 million was recorded  primarily  representing  the cost of certain  involuntary  terminations  of personnel.Pursuant to the restructuring plan, 17 positions were eliminated within the development department.   In April 2001,  the Operating  Partnership's  $10 million  investment  in Swerdlow was converted  into a loan which boreinterest at 12% and matured in December  2001.  This loan is  currently  delinquent  and is accruing  interest at 18%.  Allinterest due through the December maturity date was received.  Although the Operating  Partnership expects to fully recoverthe  amount due under this note  receivable,  the  Company  is  currently  in  negotiations  with  Swerdlow  regarding  therepayment. An affiliate of Swerdlow is a partner in the Dolphin Mall joint venture.   In August 2000,  the Company  completed a transaction  to acquire an additional  ownership in one of its  UnconsolidatedJoint  Ventures.  Under the terms of the  agreement,  the Operating  Partnership  became the 100% owner of Twelve Oaks Malland the joint venture  partner became the 100% owner of Lakeside,  subject to the existing  mortgage debt. The  transactionresulted in a net payment to the joint venture partner of  approximately  $25.5 million in cash. The results of Twelve Oakshave been  consolidated in the Company's  results  subsequent to the acquisition date (prior to that date,  Twelve Oaks wasaccounted for under the equity method as an Unconsolidated  Joint Venture).  A gain of $85.3 million on the transaction wasrecognized by the Company  representing  its share of the excess of the fair value over the net book basis of the Company'sinterest in Lakeside, adjusted for the $25.5 million paid and transaction costs.   During 2000,  the Operating  Partnership  recognized  its $9.5 million share of  extraordinary  charges  relating to theArizona  Mills and  Stamford  Town Center  refinancings,  which  consisted  of a  prepayment  premium and the  write-off ofdeferred financing costs.   In 1996,  the Operating  Partnership  entered into an agreement to lease  Memorial City Mall, a 1.4 million  square footshopping  center  located in  Houston,  Texas.  The lease was subject to certain  provisions  that  enabled  the  OperatingPartnership  to explore  significant  redevelopment  opportunities  and  terminate  the lease  obligation in the event suchredevelopment  opportunities  were not deemed to be  sufficient.  The Operating  Partnership  terminated  its Memorial Citylease on April 30, 2000.   During October and November  2001, the Operating  Partnership  completed an $82.5 million  financing  secured by RegencySquare and closed on a new $275 million  line of credit.  The net  proceeds of these  financings  were used to pay off $150million  outstanding  under  loans  previously  secured by Twelve Oaks Mall and the balance  under the  expiring  revolvingcredit facility.  In May 2001, the Company closed on a $168 million construction loan for The Mall at Wellington Green.   During  October 2000,  Arizona Mills  completed a $146 million  secured  refinancing of its existing  mortgage.  Also inOctober  2000,  MacArthur  Center  completed  a  $145  million  secured  financing,  repaying  the  existing  $120  millionconstruction  loan.  The  remaining  net  proceeds  of  approximately  $23.9  million  were  distributed  to the  OperatingPartnership,  which  contributed  all of the equity funding for the  development of the center.  In January 2000,  StamfordTown Center completed a $76 million secured  refinancing.  During 2000,  construction  facilities for $160 million and $220million were obtained for The Mall at Millenia and The Shops at Willow Bend, respectively. Investments in Technology Businesses    During 2001, the Company committed to invest  approximately $2 million in Constellation Real Technologies LLC, a companythat forms and sponsors  real estate  related  internet,  e-commerce,  and  telecommunications  enterprises.  The Company'sinvestment was $0.5 million at December 31, 2001.   In May 2000, the Company  acquired an approximately  6.8% interest in  MerchantWired,  LLC, a service company  providinginternet  and network  infrastructure  to shopping  centers and  retailers.  As of December  31,  2001,  the Company had aninvestment of  approximately  $3.6 million in this venture and has guaranteed  obligations of  approximately  $3.8 million.The principal  shareholder of  MerchantWired  has disclosed that the future  profitability of MerchantWired is dependent onit  obtaining  outside  capital  and other  management  expertise;  there is no  assurance  as to its  success in doing so.During  2001  and  2000,  the  Company  recognized  its  $2.4  million  (including  $0.6  million  of  real  estate-relateddepreciation) and $0.5 million share of MerchantWired losses, respectively.                                                           21    In April 1999,  the Company  obtained a $7.4 million  preferred  investment  in  fashionmall.com,  Inc.,  an e-commercecompany originally organized to market, promote,  advertise,  and sell fashion apparel and related accessories and productsover the  internet.  In  2001,  fashionmall.com  significantly  scaled  back its  operations  and  experienced  significantdecreases  in operating  revenues.  Fashionmall.com  management  has  disclosed  that they have more cash than is needed tofund current  operations and are  considering how best to use such cash,  including  making  acquisitions,  issuing specialdividends,  or finding  other  options to provide  opportunities  for  liquidity  to its  shareholders  at some time in thefuture.  While the Company's  right to a preference in the event of a liquidation is not disputed,  and while there is morethan sufficient cash in fashionmall.com to fund the Company's  liquidation  preference,  the Company has been in settlementdiscussions  with  fashionmall.com's  management to return the Company's  preferred  investment at a discount,  in order tofacilitate  these  potential  uses of the cash.  There is no  assurance  that the  settlement  discussions  will  achieve aresolution  and/or  what their  ultimate  outcome  will be.  During  2001,  the Company  recorded a charge of $1.9  millionrelating to its investment in fashionmall.com; the Company's investment was $5.5 million at December 31, 2001. New Accounting Pronouncements    Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133 and its related amendments and interpretations,  which establishaccounting  and  reporting  standards  for  derivative  instruments.   All  derivatives,   whether  designated  in  hedgingrelationships  or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  If the  derivative is designated asa cash  flow  hedge,  the  effective  portions  of  changes  in the fair  value of the  derivative  are  recorded  in othercomprehensive  income (OCI) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects  earnings.  Ineffectiveportions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are  recognized  in the Company's  earnings as interest  expense.The Company uses  derivative  instruments  primarily to manage  exposure to interest  rate risks  inherent in variable ratedebt and refinancings.  The Company  routinely uses cap, swap, and treasury lock agreements to meet these  objectives.  Forinterest rate cap instruments  designated as cash flow hedges,  changes in the time value were excluded from the assessmentof hedge  effectiveness.  The swap  agreement on the Dolphin  construction  facility does not qualify for hedge  accountingalthough its use is consistent with the Company's overall risk management  objectives.  As a result, the Company recognizesits share of losses and income related to this agreement in earnings as the value of the agreement changes.   The initial adoption of SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in a reduction to income of  approximately  $8.4 million asthe cumulative effect of a change in accounting  principle and a reduction to OCI of $0.8 million.  These amounts representthe transition  adjustments  necessary to mark the Company's  share of interest rate agreements to fair value as of January1, 2001.   In addition to the transition  adjustments,  the Company recognized a $3.3 million reduction of earnings during the yearended December 31, 2001,  representing  unrealized  losses due to the decline in interest rates and the resulting  decreasein  value  of  the  Company's  and  its  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures'  interest  rate  agreements.  Of  these  amounts,approximately  $2.8 million  represents the change in value of the Dolphin swap agreement and the remainder  represents thechanges in time value of other instruments.   As of December 31, 2001, the Company has $3.1 million of derivative  losses included in Accumulated OCI. Of this amount,$2.8  million  relates to a realized  loss on a hedge of the  October  2001  Regency  Square  financing.  This loss will berecognized as additional  interest  expense over the ten-year  term of the debt.  The remaining  $0.3 million of derivativelosses included in Accumulated OCI at December 31, 2001 relates to a hedge of the Dolphin Mall  construction  facility thatwill be  recognized as a reduction of earnings  through its 2002  maturity  date.  The Company  expects that  approximately$0.6 million will be  reclassified  from  Accumulated  OCI and recognized as a reduction of earnings during the next twelvemonths.   In October 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement No. 144,  "Accounting for the Impairment orDisposal of Long-Lived  Assets",  which  replaced  FASB  Statement No. 121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment of Long-LivedAssets and for Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of".  Statement 144 broadens the reporting of  discontinued  operations toinclude disposals of operating  components;  each of the Company's  investments in an operating center is such a component.The provisions of Statement 144 are effective for financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after December15, 2001 and generally  are to be applied  prospectively.  The  Statement is not expected to have a material  effect on thefinancial  condition or results of  operations  of the Company;  however,  if the Company were to dispose of a center,  thecenter's  results of  operations  would  have to be  separately  disclosed  as  discontinued  operations  in the  Company'sfinancial statements.                                                           22 Comparable Center Operations    The  performance  of the Company's  portfolio can be measured  through  comparisons of comparable  centers'  operations.During 2001,  revenues  (excluding land sales) less operating costs  (operating and recoverable  expenses) of those centersowned and open for the entire period  increased  approximately  two percent in  comparison to the same centers'  results in2000.  This growth was  primarily due to increases in minimum  rents,  revenue from  advertising  space  arrangements,  andlease  cancellation  income,  partially  offset by a decrease in percentage  rent and an increase in expenses.  The Companyexpects that  comparable  center  operations  will increase  annually by two to three  percent.  This is a  forward-lookingstatement and certain significant  factors could cause the actual results to differ materially;  refer to the General Risksof the Company in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001. Other Income    The Company has certain additional sources of income beyond its rental revenues,  recoveries from tenants,  and revenuesfrom  management,  leasing,  and development  services,  as summarized in the following table. The Company expects that theshopping  center-related  revenues,  such as income from parking  garages or  sponsorship  agreements,  will grow at a rateslightly higher than the rate of inflation.  During 2001,  gains on peripheral land sales were less than the  approximately$6 million  average of the  preceding  three  years;  the  Company  expects  that 2002 gains on land sales will return to arange of $6 million to $7 million.  Interest  income in 2001 and 2000 exceeded  historical  averages;  the Company  expectsthat 2002  interest  income will range  between $2 million and $3 million.  Lease  cancellation  income is dependent on theoverall  economy and  performance  of particular  retailers in specific  locations and is difficult to predict;  2001 leasecancellation income  significantly  exceeded  historical  averages.  Estimates regarding  anticipated 2002 other income areforward-looking  statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially,  includingbut not  limited  to: 1) actual  results  of  negotiations  with  tenants,  counterparties,  and  potential  purchasers  ofperipheral land, and 2) timing of transactions.                                                                      2001                         2000                                                                      ----                         ----                                                               (Operating Partnership's share in millions of dollars)         Shopping center related revenues                             13.8                         13.6         Gains on peripheral land sales                                4.6                          9.1         Lease cancellation revenue                                   10.3                          1.6         Interest income                                               4.9                          4.3                                                                       ---                          ---                                                                      33.6                         28.6                                                                      ====                         ==== Subsequent Events    In early 2002,  the  Operating  Partnership  entered  into a definitive  purchase and sale  agreement to acquire for $88million a 50% general  partnership  interest in  SunValley  Associates,  a  California  general  partnership  that owns theSunvalley  Shopping Center located in Concord,  California.  The $88 million purchase price consists of $28 million of cashand $60 million of existing  debt that  encumbers the  property.  The Company's  interest in the secured debt consists of a$55 million  primary note bearing  interest at LIBOR plus 0.92% and a $5 million note bearing  interest at LIBOR plus 3.0%.The notes mature in September 2003 and have two one-year  extension  options.  The center is also subject to a ground leasethat  expires in 2061.  The Manager has managed the property  since its  development  and will  continue to do so after theacquisition.  The other 50% partner in the  property  is an entity  owned and  controlled  by Mr. A.  Alfred  Taubman,  theCompany's largest shareholder and recently retired Chairman of the Board of Directors.   Also in early 2002,  the Company  entered  into  agreements  to sell its  interests  in LaCumbre  Plaza and Paseo Nuevo,subject to satisfying closing  conditions,  for $77 million.  The centers are subject to ground leases and are unencumberedby debt. The centers were purchased in 1996 for $59 million.   These  transactions are expected to close during the first half of 2002, and the Company expects to use the net proceedsfrom the sale of the two centers to fund the  acquisition of Sunvalley and pay down  borrowings  under the Company's  linesof credit.  Assuming  the  operations  of these two centers are included in Funds from  Operations  for the period owned in2002, the Company  expects that these  transactions  will have a neutral effect on Funds from Operations in 2002. This is aforward-looking  statement and certain  significant  factors could cause the actual effect to differ materially,  includingbut not limited to 1) the occurrence and timing of the  transactions,  2) actual  operations of the centers,  3) actual useof proceeds, 4) actual transaction costs, and 5) resolution of closing conditions.                                                           23 Presentation of Operating Results    The  following  tables  contain  the  combined  operating  results  of the  Company's  Consolidated  Businesses  and theUnconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  Income  allocated to the minority  partners in the  Operating  Partnership  and preferredinterests is deducted to arrive at the results  allocable to the Company's  common  shareowners.  Because the net equity ofthe  Operating  Partnership  is less than zero,  the income  allocated to the minority  partners is equal to their share ofdistributions.  The net equity of these minority  partners is less than zero due to accumulated  distributions in excess ofnet income  and not as a result of  operating  losses.  Distributions  to  partners  are  usually  greater  than net incomebecause net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization,  although  distributions were less than netincome during 2000 due to the gain on the  disposition of Lakeside  described  above.  Also,  losses  allocable to minoritypartners in certain  consolidated joint ventures are added back to arrive at the net results of the Company.  The Company'saverage  ownership  percentage of the Operating  Partnership was 62% and 63% for 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The resultsof Twelve Oaks Mall are included in the Consolidated  Businesses  subsequent to the closing of the transaction,  while bothTwelve Oaks Mall and Lakeside are included as Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for previous periods.                                                           24 Comparison of 2001 to 2000    The following table sets forth operating results for 2001 and 2000,  showing

Minimum rentsalso increased due to the inclusion of Twelve Oaks Mall,  tenant  rollovers,  and new sources of rental  income,  includingtemporary  tenants and  advertising  space  arrangements.  Percentage  rents increased due to increases in tenant sales andthe  inclusion  of  Twelve  Oaks.  Expense  recoveries  increased  primarily  due to  MacArthur  Center  and  Twelve  Oaks.Management,  leasing,  and  development  revenues  increased  primarily  due to  contracts  acquired  as part  of the  LordAssociates  transaction,  partially  offset by decreases  due to a reduction in fees in certain  managed  centers,  and thetiming and  completion  status of certain  other  contracts  and  services.  Other  revenue  increased  primarily due to anincrease in gains on sales of peripheral land and interest  income,  partially  offset by a decrease in lease  cancellationrevenue.   Total  operating  costs were $262.3  million,  a $25.3  million or 10.7%  increase from 1999.  Recoverable  expenses anddepreciation  and  amortization  increased  primarily  due to MacArthur  Center and Twelve Oaks.  Other  operating  expenseincreased due to MacArthur  Center,  Twelve Oaks,  the Lord  Associates  transaction,  and an increase in bad debt expense,offset by a decrease  in the  charge to  operations  for costs of  pre-development  activities.  Management,  leasing,  anddevelopment costs increased  primarily due to the Lord Associates  contracts.  Interest expense increased  primarily due toan increase in interest  rates and  borrowings,  including  debt assumed and incurred  related to Twelve Oaks. In addition,interest expense  increased because of a decrease in capitalized  interest upon opening  MacArthur Center.  These increaseswere offset by a reduction in interest expense on debt paid down with proceeds of the preferred equity offerings. Unconsolidated Joint Ventures    Total  revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2000 were $230.7  million,  a $21.3  million or 8.5%  decrease from thecomparable period of 1999.  Minimum rents and expense recoveries  decreased  primarily because the Twelve Oaks and Lakesideresults were only included  through the  transaction  date.  Other revenue  decreased  primarily due to a decrease in leasecancellation revenue, partially offset by an increase in gains on sales of peripheral land.   Total  operating  costs  decreased by $4.5 million to $172.0 million for the year ended  December 31, 2000.  Recoverableexpenses decreased  primarily due to Twelve Oaks and Lakeside.

As a result of the foregoing,  income before extraordinary items of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures decreased by $17.0million,  or 22.5%,  to $58.6 million.  The Company's  equity in income before  extraordinary  items of the  UnconsolidatedJoint Ventures was $28.5 million, a 27.5% decrease from the comparable period in 1999.

The  Company  does not have,  and has not had,  any parentcompany  indebtedness;  all debt discussed  represents  obligations of the Operating  Partnership or its  subsidiaries  andjoint ventures.

Sensitivity Analysis    The Company has exposure to interest  rate risk on its debt  obligations  and interest  rate  instruments.  Based on theOperating  Partnership's  beneficial  interest in debt and interest  rates in effect at December 31, 2001,  excluding  debtfixed under  long-term  LIBOR rate  contracts,  a one percent  increase or decrease in interest rates on this floating ratedebt would  decrease or increase  annual cash flows by  approximately  $4.0 million  and, due to the effect of  capitalizedinterest,  annual earnings by approximately  $3.7 million.  Based on the Company's  consolidated debt and interest rates ineffect at  December  31,  2001,  a one  percent  increase  in  interest  rates  would  decrease  the fair  value of debt byapproximately  $43.2  million,  while a one percent  decrease in interest  rates would  increase  the fair value of debt byapproximately $46.4 million.   In March 2002,  the Company  entered into a one year 4.3% swap agreement  based on a notional  amount of $100 million tobegin November 1, 2002, as a hedge of the Company's $275 million line of credit.                                                           31 Covenants and Commitments    Certain loan agreements contain various restrictive  covenants  including minimum net worth  requirements,  minimum debtservice and fixed charges  coverage ratios,  a maximum payout ratio on  distributions,  and a minimum debt yield ratio, thelatter being the most restrictive. The Operating Partnership is in compliance with all of its covenants.   The Company's secured credit facilities contain customary covenants requiring the maintenance of comprehensive  all-riskinsurance on property securing each facility.  As a result of expected  exclusions or coverage  reductions in its insurancepolicies upon renewal, the Company expects to purchase supplemental  coverage for terrorist acts at significant  additionalcost.  Although,  based on  preliminary  discussions  with its  insurance  agency and certain of its  lenders,  the Companybelieves it will be able to purchase  satisfactory  additional  coverage at increased,  though not  prohibitive,  costs. Noassurances  can be given that such  coverage  will be adequate or that  mortgagees  will not require  coverage  beyond thatwhich is commercially  available at reasonable  rates. The Company's  inability to obtain such coverage or to do so only atgreatly increased costs may also negatively impact the availability and cost of future financing.   Certain debt agreements contain  performance and valuation criteria that must be met for the loans to be extended at thefull principal amounts;  these agreements provide for partial  prepayments of debt to facilitate  compliance with extensionprovisions.   Payments of principal and interest on the loans in the following  table are  guaranteed by the Operating  Partnership asof December 31,  2001.  All of the loan  agreements  provide for a reduction of the amounts  guaranteed  as certain  centerperformance and valuation criteria are met.

Effective February 2002, the guarantee on the International  Plaza loan     was reduced to 50%. Funds from Operations    A principal factor that the Company  considers in determining  dividends to shareowners is Funds from Operations  (FFO),which is defined as income before  extraordinary  items, real estate  depreciation and amortization,  and the allocation tothe minority interest in the Operating  Partnership,  less preferred dividends and distributions.  Gains on dispositions ofdepreciated  operating  properties  are  excluded  from  FFO.  In 2001,  a $1.9  million  charge  related  to a  technologyinvestment was also excluded.    Funds from  Operations  does not represent  cash flows from  operations,  as defined by generally  accepted  accountingprinciples,  and should not be considered to be an  alternative  to net income as an indicator of operating  performance orto cash flows from  operations as a measure of  liquidity.  However,  the National  Association  of Real Estate  InvestmentTrusts  suggests that Funds from Operations is a useful  supplemental  measure of operating  performance  for REITs.  Fundsfrom Operations as presented by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.                                                           32 Reconciliation of Income to Funds from Operations                                                                                       2001                2000                                                                                      ----                ----                                                                                      (in millions of dollars)Income before gain on disposition of interest in center,  extraordinary items, cumulative effect of change in  accounting principle, and minority and preferred interests (1) (2)                  55.7                66.5Depreciation and amortization (3)                                                     68.9                57.8Share of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures'  depreciation and amortization (4)                                                   23.9                19.4Charge related to technology investment                                                1.9Non-real estate depreciation                                                          (2.7)               (3.0)Minority partners in consolidated joint ventures share  of funds from operations                                                            (2.5)               (2.4)Preferred dividends and distributions                                                (25.6)              (25.6)                                                                                     -----               -----Funds from Operations - TRG                                                          119.5               112.7                                                                                     =====               =====Funds from Operations allocable to TCO                                                73.5                70.4                                                                                     =====               =====(1)  Includes  gains on  peripheral  land  sales of $4.6 million  and $9.1 million for  the  years ended  December 31, 2001     and 2000, respectively.(2)  Includes net  non-cash  straightline  adjustments  to minimum rent revenue  and  ground  rent  expense of $1.1 million     and $(0.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.(3)  Includes  $2.7 million and $2.4 million  of  mall  tenant  allowance  amortization  for  the years ended  December 31,     2001 and 2000, respectively.(4)  Includes  $2.4  million  and  $2.2 million  of mall tenant  allowance  amortization  for the years ended  December 31,     2001 and 2000, respectively.(5)  Amounts in the tables may not add due to rounding.

Dividends to its commonshareowners  are at the  discretion  of the  Board of  Directors  and  depend on the cash  available  to the  Company,  itsfinancial condition,  capital and other requirements,  and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.  Toqualify as a REIT,  the Company must  distribute  at least 90% of its REIT taxable  income to its  shareowners,  as well asmeet certain  other  requirements.  Preferred  dividends  accrue  regardless of whether  earnings,  cash  availability,  orcontractual  obligations  were to prohibit the current  payment of dividends.  The  preferred  stock is callable in October2002.  The Company has no present intention to redeem the preferred equity.   On December 11, 2001, the Company  declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.255 per common share payable January 22, 2002 toshareowners  of record on December 31,  2001.  The Board of Directors  also  declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.51875 pershare on the  Company's  8.3% Series A Preferred  Stock,  paid December 31, 2001 to  shareowners  of record on December 21,2001.   Common  dividends  declared  totaled  $1.005 per common share in 2001, of which $0.3075  represented  return of capital,$0.6878  represented  ordinary income,  and $0.0097  represented  capital gain,  compared to dividends  declared in 2000 of$0.985 per common  share,  of which  $0.4402  represented  return of capital and $0.4799  represented  ordinary  income and$0.0649  represented  capital gain.  The tax status of total 2002 common  dividends  declared and to be declared,  assumingcontinuation of a $0.255 per common share quarterly dividend,  is estimated to be approximately 28% return of capital,  andapproximately  72% ordinary  income.  Series A preferred  dividends  declared were $2.075 per  preferred  share in 2001 and2000, of which $2.0549  represented  ordinary income and $0.0201  represented capital gains in 2001 and $1.9382 representedordinary  income and  $0.1368  represented  capital  gains in 2000.  The tax status of total 2002  dividends  to be paid onSeries A Preferred  Stock is  estimated  to be 100%  ordinary  income.  These are  forward-looking  statements  and certainsignificant  factors could cause the actual results to differ materially,  including:  1) the amount of dividends declared,2) changes in the Company's share of anticipated  taxable income of the Operating  Partnership due to the actual results ofthe Operating  Partnership,  3) changes in the number of the Company's  outstanding  shares,  4) property  acquisitions  ordispositions,  5) financing  transactions,  including refinancing of existing debt, 6) changes in interest rates, 7) amountand nature of development activities, and 8) changes in the tax laws or their application.   The annual  determination  of the Company's  common  dividends is based on anticipated  Funds from Operations  availableafter preferred  dividends,  as well as financing  considerations and other appropriate  factors.  Further, the Company hasdecided  that the  growth in common  dividends  will be less than the  growth in Funds from  Operations  for the  immediatefuture.  Based on current tax laws and earnings  projections,  the Company expects that the growth in common dividends willbe less than the growth in Funds from Operations for at least three more years.   Any  inability of the  Operating  Partnership  or its Joint  Ventures to secure  financing as required to fund  maturingdebts, capital expenditures and changes in working capital,  including development  activities and expansions,  may requirethe utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations,  thereby possibly reducing  distributions to partners of the OperatingPartnership and funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends.                                                           34 Capital Spending    Capital spending for routine maintenance of the shopping centers is generally  recovered from tenants.

The Operating  Partnership's share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased during the year, excluding expansionspace and new  developments,  was $15.26 in 2001 and $16.39 in 2000.  In addition,  the  Operating  Partnership's  share ofcapitalized  leasing costs in 2001,  excluding  new  developments,  was $8.7 million,  or $10.32 per square foot leased and$7.6 million or $10.54 per square foot leased during the year in 2000.   The Operating  Partnership  has entered into a 50% owned joint venture to develop The Mall at Millenia  currently  underconstruction in Orlando,  Florida.  This project is expected to cost  approximately  $200 million and open in October 2002.The Mall at Millenia will be anchored by Bloomingdale's, Macy's, and Neiman Marcus.                                                          35   Stony Point Fashion Park, a new 690,000 square foot open-air center under  construction in Richmond,  Virginia,  will beanchored by Dillard's and Saks. The center is scheduled to open in September 2003.   The Company's  approximately $22 million balance of development  pre-construction costs as of December 31, 2001 consistsprimarily  of costs  relating  to a  project  in  Syosset,  New  York.  Both  Neiman  Marcus  and Lord & Taylor  have  madeannouncements  committing to the project.  The Company is currently  involved in a lawsuit to obtain the  necessary  zoningapprovals to move forward with the project.  Although  the Company  expects to be  successful  in this effort,  the processmay not be resolved in the near  future.  In addition,  if the  litigation  is  unsuccessful,  the Company  would expect torecover substantially less than its cost in this project under possible alternative uses for the site.   The Operating Partnership and The Mills Corporation have formed an alliance to develop value super-regional  projects inmajor  metropolitan  markets.  The amended  agreement,  which  expires in May 2008,  calls for the two companies to jointlydevelop and own at least four of these centers,  each  representing  approximately  $200 million of capital  investment.  Anumber of locations across the nation are targeted for future initiatives.

The Operating  Partnership  anticipates that  its share of costs for development  projects  scheduled to be completed in2003 will be as much as $80 million in 2003.  Estimates of future capital  spending  include only projects  approved by theCompany's Board of Directors and,  consequently,  estimates will change as new projects are approved.  Estimates  regardingcapital  expenditures  presented  above are  forward-looking  statements  and certain  significant  factors could cause theactual  results to differ  materially,  including  but not  limited to: 1) actual  results of  negotiations  with  anchors,tenants, and contractors,  2) changes in the scope and number of projects, 3) cost overruns, 4) timing of expenditures,  5)financing  considerations,  6) actual time to complete projects, 7) changes in economic climate, 8) competition from othersattracting tenants and customers, and 9) increases in operating costs. Cash Tender Agreement    A.  Alfred  Taubman  has the annual  right to tender to the  Company  units of  partnership  interest  in the  OperatingPartnership  (provided  that the  aggregate  value is at least $50  million) and cause the Company to purchase the tenderedinterests at a purchase  price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the trading date  immediately  preceding  thedate of the tender (the Cash Tender  Agreement).  At A.  Alfred  Taubman's  election,  his family,  and certain  others mayparticipate in tenders.  The Company will have the option to pay for these interests from available  cash,  borrowed funds,or from the  proceeds of an  offering of the  Company's  common  stock.  Generally,  the Company  expects to finance  thesepurchases  through  the sale of new shares of its stock.  The  tendering  partner  will bear all market  risk if the marketprice at closing is less than the  purchase  price and will bear the costs of sale.  Any proceeds of the offering in excessof the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of the Company.   Based on a market  value at December  31, 2001 of $14.85 per common  share,  the  aggregate  value of  interests  in theOperating  Partnership that may be tendered under the Cash Tender Agreement was  approximately  $366 million.  The purchaseof these  interests  at December  31, 2001 would have  resulted in the Company  owning an  additional  30%  interest in theOperating Partnership.                                                          36 Item 7A.
