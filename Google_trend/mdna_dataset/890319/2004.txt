Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.      MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS              The  following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains  various forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,  as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking  statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including the following:  statements regarding future developments and joint ventures, rents and returns, statements regarding  the continuation of trends, and any statements regarding the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash  generated from operating and financing activities for our future liquidity and capital resource needs.  We caution that although forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs and best judgment  based upon current information, these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause  actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those risks,  uncertainties, and factors detailed from time to time in reports filed with the SEC, and in particular  those set forth under the headings General Risks of the Company and Environmental Matters in our  Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying  Consolidated Financial Statements of Taubman Centers, Inc. and the Notes thereto.     General Background and Performance Measurement               Taubman  Centers, Inc. (we, us, our or TCO) owns a managing general partners interest in The Taubman  Realty Group Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership or TRG), through which we conduct all of  our operations. The Operating Partnership owns, develops, acquires, and operates regional shopping centers  nationally. The Consolidated Businesses consist of shopping centers that are controlled by ownership  or contractual agreement, development projects for future regional shopping centers, and The Taubman  Company LLC (the Manager). Shopping centers that are not controlled and that are owned through joint  ventures with third parties (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.               References  in this discussion to beneficial interest refer to our ownership or pro-rata share of the item being  discussed. Also, the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their  performance as a whole, without regard to our ownership interest. Consequently, in addition to the discussion  of the operations of the Consolidated Businesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  are presented and discussed as a whole.              There  are a number of items that affect the comparability of information used in measuring performance. During  2003, we opened Stony Point Fashion Park (Results of Operations  Recent Openings), acquired an interest  in Waterside Shops at Pelican Bay, and sold our interest in Biltmore Fashion Park (Results of Operations   Acquisitions and Dispositions). During 2002, we opened The Mall at Millenia (Results of Operations   Recent Openings). Also during 2002, we acquired an interest in Sunvalley and sold our interests in  La Cumbre Plaza and Paseo Nuevo (Results of Operations  Acquisitions and Dispositions). We opened four  new shopping centers during 2001, which are currently not at stabilization. Additional comparable center  statistics that exclude Biltmore, La Cumbre Plaza, The Mall at Millenia, Paseo Nuevo, Stony Point, Sunvalley,  Waterside Shops at Pelican Bay, and the centers that opened in 2001 are provided to present the performance  of comparable centers in our continuing operations.     Overall Summary of Management's Discussion and Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations               Our  business is to lease space in our shopping centers. Generally these leases are long term (7 to 10 years).  Therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants sales and consequently their ability  to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability  to find new tenants for our shopping centers. Tenant rents and expense recoveries represent over 90%  of our total revenues. We recently have experienced decreases in occupancy, primarily due to unscheduled  tenant closings. The impact on our income has been somewhat moderated by a significant increase in lease  cancellation revenue and leasing to temporary in-line tenants. These trends are discussed under Current  Operating Trends. The trend in tenant sales improved in 2003. Sales per square foot in 2003 continued  to lead the industry, while mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of sales are within our historical  norms. See Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues and Rental Rates and Occupancy.     16                 The  rents we are able to achieve are similarly affected by economic trends and tenants expectations thereof,  as described under Rental Rates and Occupancy. In 2003, the spread between rents of tenants opening  and those closing was within historical norms. Mall tenant sales, occupancy levels and our resulting  revenues are seasonal in nature. Refer to Seasonality for these relationships, as well as descriptions  of revenues that historically are not as predictable.              Our  analysis of our financial results begins under Results of Operations. We have been active in developing  and expanding our shopping center portfolio, and we describe the most recent center openings, including  Stony Point Fashion Park and The Mall at Millenia under Recent Openings. Also, over the last two years,  we acquired additional interests in six centers and disposed of interests in three, as discussed under  Acquisitions and Dispositions.              We similarly  have been very active in managing our balance sheet, completing a series of new financings or refinancings  of existing debt, as well as a series of stock buybacks, issuances of partnership equity, and redemptions  of partners interests in TRG, as outlined under Debt Transactions and Equity Transactions. We believe  good balance sheet management  both for debt and equity  will continue to minimize exposure to interest  rate risk and ensure adequate liquidity over the coming years.              In the  fall of 2002, we received an unsolicited proposal from Simon Property Group, which sought to acquire  control of the company. A tender offer and litigation were commenced but ultimately ended in 2003 as  described under Unsolicited Tender Offer.              We have  certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues and recoveries from tenants. We disclose  the Operating Partnerships share of these sources of income under Other Income. Included in this  income are lease cancellation income and gains on peripheral land sales , which in 2003 were at a historical  high and close to a historical low, respectively. The timing of this income is difficult to predict.  Other sources of income derived from our shopping centers, such as parking garage and sponsorship income,  have been increasing.              We provide  property management, leasing, development, and other administrative services to centers owned by General  Motors pension trusts, other third parties, and certain Taubman affiliates. The General Motors pension  trusts contracts are cancelable with 90 days notice. Certain annual overhead costs allocated to these  contracts would not be eliminated if they were to be canceled or not renewed.              Certain  significant transactions that occurred in 2004, including financings and an acquisition of an additional  interest in Beverly Center, are discussed in Subsequent Events. The preparation of our financial statements  requires management to make significant estimates when applying certain accounting policies. Background  and discussion of these policies, including those related to the valuation of our shopping centers,  capitalization of development costs, valuation of accounts receivable, and valuations for acquired property  and intangibles, are contained under Application of Critical Accounting Policies.              With  all the preceding information as background, we have then provided insight and explanations for variances  in our financial results from 2001 through 2003 under Comparison of 2003 to 2002 and Comparison of  2002 to 2001". As information useful to understanding our results, we have described the presentation  of our minority interest, the recent dispositions of interests in centers, and the reasons for our use  of non-GAAP statistics such as EBITDA and Funds from Operations (FFO) under Presentation of Operating  Results. Reconciliations from net income allocable to common shareowners to these statistics follow  the annual comparisons.              Our  discussion of sources and uses of capital resources under Liquidity and Capital Resources begins with  a brief overview of capital activities and transactions occurring in 2003. Analysis of specific operating,  investing, and financing activities is then provided in more detail. Cash flows from rents and recoveries  provide the resources for payments of interest and other operating expenses, leasing costs, and generally  for required distributions and dividends. Recent positive operating cash flow generated by new center  openings, increases in rents, and other positive events offset the cash used in connection with the  unsolicited tender offer. Similarly, significant capital outflows continue in connection with the construction  of new centers and acquisitions, financed through sales of centers, debt, and certain equity issuances.      17                 Funding  for new developments, acquisitions, and other capital spending typically is provided by new borrowings.  As new developments reach their expected stabilized occupancy, we may be able to refinance the assets  for more than the original financings, providing additional resources for growth. Specific analysis  of our fixed and floating rates and periods of interest rate risk exposure is provided under Beneficial  Interest in Debt. Completing our analysis of our exposure to rates are the effects of changes in interest  rates on our cash flows and fair values of debt contained under Sensitivity Analysis.              In conducting  our business, we enter into various contractual obligations, including those for debt, capital leases  for property improvements, operating leases for office space and land, purchase obligations, and other  long-term commitments. Detail of these obligations, including expected settlement periods, is contained  under Contractual Obligations. Property-level debt represents the largest single class of obligations,  in both total amount and near-term maturity/expected settlement. Described under Loan Commitments and  Guarantees and Cash Tender Agreement are our significant guarantees and commitments.              Development,  renovation, and expansion of new and existing malls continues to be a significant use of our capital,  as described in Capital Spending and Planned Capital Spending. Recent spending includes that related  to the recently opened Stony Point Fashion Park and The Mall at Millenia, and the currently under construction  Northlake Mall. A use of future capital may be for our planned Oyster Bay project in Syosset, New York.  We hope to resolve entitlement issues and receive the necessary approvals to begin construction in late  2004 for a planned 2006 opening of this project.              Dividends  are also significant uses of our capital resources. Tax status of our dividends and the factors considered  when determining the amount of our dividends, including requirements arising because of our status as  a REIT, are described under Dividends. We again increased our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter  of 2003.     Current Operating Trends               Since  2001 the regional shopping center industry has been affected by the softness in the national economy.  Economic and geopolitical pressures that affect consumer confidence, job growth, energy costs, and income  gains can affect retail sales growth and impact our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at  advantageous rates. The impact of a soft economy on our current results of operations can be moderated  by lease cancellation income, which tends to increase in down-cycles of the economy. During 2003, we  recognized our approximately $11.7 million share of lease cancellation revenue, which exceeded historical  averages; this level of lease cancellation income is not indicative of future periods (see Results of  Operations  Other Income).              Our  sales statistics have shown improvement over the last nine months of 2003 (see Mall Tenant Sales and  Center Revenues). Sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay.  The effects of increases or declines in sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor  share of total rents (approximately two percent) percentage rents represent. However, a sustained trend  in sales does impact, either negatively or positively, our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate  rents at advantageous rates.              In 2003,  we experienced a decrease in occupancy from 2002 (see Rental Rates and Occupancy). Increased income  from temporary in-line tenants, which has become an integral part of our business, partially offsets  the impact of lower occupancy in the portfolio. Temporary tenants, defined as those with lease terms  less than 12 months, are not included in occupancy or leased space statistics. As of December 31, 2003,  approximately 3.7% of space was occupied by temporary tenants.     Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues                Over  the long term, the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of  the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately 90% of these revenues and because mall  tenant sales determine the amount of rent, percentage rent, and recoverable expenses (together, total  occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However, levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably  more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs.              We believe  that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases  as sales per square foot increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because  most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still  be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot.     18                 The  following table summarizes occupancy costs, excluding utilities, for mall tenants as a percentage of  mall tenant sales:                 2003     2002     2001           Mall tenant sales (in thousands)     $   3,417,572     $   3,113,620     $   2,797,867      Sales per square foot  (1)     468     457     465           Minimum rents     10.5  %  10.6  %  10.0  %   Percentage rents     0.2   0.2   0.2    Expense recoveries     5.0   5.0   4.5                     Mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of        mall tenant sales  (2)     15.7  %  15.8  %  14.7  %                         (1)   Sales per square foot is presented for the comparable centers, excluding value centers (Arizona Mills, Dolphin Mall, and Great Lakes Crossing).         (2)   For the comparable centers, mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of sales were 15.5%, 15.5%, and 14.9% for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.                Tenant  sales per square foot in 2003 increased by 2.4% compared to 2002. Sales per square foot have increased  year over year for each of the last nine months of 2003.     Rental Rates and Occupancy               As leases  have expired in the shopping centers, we have generally been able to rent the available space, either  to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases.  In a period of increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future  growth become more optimistic. In periods of slower growth or declining sales, rents on new leases will  grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason. However, center revenues nevertheless increase  as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current  rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases. The following table  contains certain information regarding rentals at the comparable shopping centers:              2003  2002  2001   Average minimum rent per square foot  $42.97  $42.18  $41.83   Average minimum rent per square foot-stores     opening during year  $47.10  $44.63  $50.36   Square feet of GLA opened  671,019  774,016  657,815   Average minimum rent per square foot-stores     closing during year  $42.02  $42.46  $41.11   Square feet of GLA closed  822,688  661,981  803,452               The  opening and closing rent statistics are not computed on comparable tenant spaces, and can vary significantly  from period to period depending on the total amount, location, and average size of tenant space opening  and closing in the period.              Generally,  the rent spread between opening and closing stores is in our historic range of $5.00 to $10.00 per square  foot. This statistic is difficult to predict in part because of unscheduled lease terminations, which  may have actual average closing rents per square foot that vary from the average rent per square foot  of scheduled lease expirations.              In 2003,  the square feet of GLA opened decreased from 2002, primarily due to certain large tenant spaces (greater  than 10,000 square feet) that opened in 2002. During 2003, the number of tenants opened in the 13 comparable  centers actually increased from 2002. The number of square feet of GLA closed increased in 2003 due  to a number of unscheduled lease terminations and bankruptcies.     19                 Mall  tenant average occupancy, ending occupancy, and leased space rates are as follows:                 2003     2002     2001      All Centers:         Leased space     88.4  %  90.3  %  87.7  %      Ending occupancy     86.1   87.0   84.0       Average occupancy     85.6   84.8   84.9         Comparable Centers:         Leased space     90.0  %  93.3  %  91.7  %      Ending occupancy     88.1   90.3   88.5       Average occupancy     87.8   88.2   87.6                A number  of unscheduled lease terminations and bankruptcies accounted for the majority of the decline in comparable  center occupancy. Tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases was  2.3% in 2003, compared to 1.7% in 2002 and 4.5% in 2001. We are expecting a reversal of this decline  in occupancy by mid 2004 and anticipate 2004 year end to be ahead of 2002 occupancy.     Seasonality              The  regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth  quarter due to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant, sales fluctuations associated  with the Easter holiday and back-to-school events. While minimum rents and recoveries are generally  not subject to seasonal factors, most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter, and the majority  of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Additionally,  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, revenues and occupancy levels  are generally highest in the fourth quarter. Included in revenues are gains on sales of peripheral land  and lease cancellation income that may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.              1st Quarter 2003  2nd Quarter 2003  3rd Quarter 2003  4th Quarter 2003  Total 2003         (in thousands)   Mall tenant sales     $706,227     $764,404     $775,154     $1,171,787     $3,417,572      Revenues     176,930     173,511     168,380     189,650     708,471      Occupancy:           Ending-comparable     87.8  %  87.8  %  87.1  %  88.1  %  88.1  %        Average-comparable     88.4   87.7   87.4   88.0   87.8         Ending     85.5   85.5   85.2   86.1   86.1         Average     85.7   85.4   85.4   85.9   85.6    Leased space:           Comparable     91.1   90.2   90.1   90.0   90.0         All centers     88.6   88.0   88.4   88.4   88.4                Because  the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries,  mall tenant occupancy costs (the sum of minimum rents, percentage rents, and expense recoveries) relative  to sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter.               1st Quarter 2003  2nd Quarter 2003  3rd Quarter 2003  4th Quarter 2003  Total 2003        Minimum rents     12.5  %  11.3  %  11.5  %  8.0  %  10.5  %   Percentage rents     0.3   0.1   0.1   0.3   0.2    Expense recoveries     5.9   6.1   5.1   3.8   5.0                               Mall tenant occupancy costs     18.7  %  17.5  %  16.7  %  12.1  %  15.7  %                                 20        Results of Operations     Recent Openings               Stony  Point Fashion Park, a wholly-owned regional center, opened September 18, 2003 in Richmond, Virginia.  Stony Point Fashion Park has performed well since its opening. The center is fully leased and was 92%  occupied by December 2003. The 2004 return on Stony Point is expected to be approximately 10.5%. The  665,000 square foot center is anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue, Galyans, and Dillards.              The  Mall at Millenia, a 1.1 million square foot regional center in which the Operating Partnership has a  50% interest, opened in October 2002, in Orlando, Florida. The Mall at Millenia was 95% occupied at  December 31, 2003.              The  Mall at Wellington Green, a 90% owned 1.3 million square foot regional center, opened in October 2001  in Wellington, Florida. A new anchor, Nordstrom, and additional tenant space opened in November 2003.  International Plaza, a 26% owned 1.2 million square foot regional center, opened in September 2001 in  Tampa, Florida. The Shops at Willow Bend, a wholly-owned 1.3 million square foot regional center, opened  in August 2001 in Plano, Texas. A new anchor, Saks Fifth Avenue, will open in September 2004. Dolphin  Mall, a 1.3 million square foot value regional center, opened in March 2001, in Miami, Florida. In October  2002, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in Dolphin Mall (see Results of Operations  Acquisitions  and Dispositions).              Estimates  regarding returns are forward-looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual  results to differ materially, including but not limited to: (1) actual results of negotiations with  tenants, (2) timing of tenant openings, (3) early lease terminations and bankruptcies, (4) sales performance  of the centers, and (5) increases in operating costs.     Acquisitions and Dispositions              In December  2003, we sold our interest in Biltmore Fashion Park to The Macerich Company. The sales price consisted  of $51 million of cash and $30.2 million in Macerich partnership units (which were then used as consideration  for redeeming the former Biltmore owners TRG partnership interests, see Equity Transactions). Biltmore  Fashion Park was encumbered by $77.4 million of property level fixed rate debt maturing in July 2009  and bearing an interest rate of 7.68%. We recognized a gain of approximately $48 million representing  the excess of the sales price over the book value of our investment in the center.              Also  in December 2003, we acquired a 25% interest in Waterside Shops at Pelican Bay, located in Naples, Florida,  for $22 million in cash. We are exploring redevelopment opportunities along with the Forbes Company,  which is managing the center.              In July  2003, we acquired an additional 25% interest in MacArthur Center, bringing our ownership in the shopping  center to 95%, for $4.9 million in cash and 190,909 operating partnership units. Although the number  of units issued was determined based on a negotiated value of $27.50 per unit, these units have been  recorded based on our common share price of $19.48 as of the closing date of July 10, 2003.              In March  2003, we acquired the 15% minority interest in Great Lakes Crossing for $3.2 million in cash, pursuant  to a favorable pricing formula pre-established in the partnership agreement, bringing our ownership  in the center to 100%.              In October  2002, we acquired Swerdlow Real Estate Groups (Swerdlows) 50% interest in Dolphin Mall, bringing our  ownership in the shopping center to 100%. The results of Dolphin have been consolidated in our results  subsequent to the acquisition date (prior to that date, Dolphin was accounted for under the equity method  as an Unconsolidated Joint Venture). In May 2002, we acquired a 50% general partnership interest in  SunValley Associates, a California general partnership that owns the Sunvalley shopping center located  in Concord, California; Sunvalley is accounted for under the equity method as an Unconsolidated Joint  Venture. Also in May 2002, we purchased an additional interest in Arizona Mills, bringing our interest  in the center to 50%, and sold our interest in Paseo Nuevo. In March 2002, we sold our interest in La  Cumbre Plaza.              See  also Subsequent Events.     21        Debt Transactions              We completed  a series of debt transactions in the three year period ended December 31, 2003, as follows:             Date  Initial Loan Balance/Facility  Stated Interest Rate  Maturity Date  (1)     (in millions)   The Shops at Willow Bend-  August 2003  $    13                      LIBOR+1.65%  August 2005      land loan   The Shops at Willow Bend  June 2003  150                      LIBOR+2.90%  July 2006   Mall at Millenia  March 2003  210                      5.46%  April 2013   Great Lakes Crossing  February 2003  151                      5.25%  March 2013   International Plaza  December 2002  192                      4.21%  January 2008   Sunvalley  December 2002  135                      5.67%  November 2012   Stony Point Fashion Park-  August 2002  105                      LIBOR+1.85%  August 2005      construction loan        or Prime+0.35%   Westfarms  July 2002  210                      6.10%  July 2012   TRG  November 2001  275                      LIBOR+0.90%  November 2004            or Prime   Regency Square  October 2001  83                      6.75%  November 2011   The Mall at Wellington Green-  May 2001  168                      LIBOR+1.85%  May 2004      construction loan        or Prime+0.50%        (1)   Excludes any options to extend the maturities (refer to the footnotes to our financial statements regarding extension options).

(3)   Reflects units of partnership interest issued without any corresponding change in our common shares outstanding.                The  December 2003 repurchase transaction, which occurred immediately following the sale of Biltmore Fashion  Park, included the transfer of the Macerich units received from the sale to several Operating Partnership  unitholders in redemption and retirement of their Operating Partnership units. These unitholders were  the original owners of Biltmore Fashion Park.              The  partnership units issued in connection with the May 2003 investment have the same attributes as existing  partnership units, except that they do not have voting rights and have limited resale rights for a specified  period of time. An affiliate of the investor owned an interest in Beverly Center, which we purchased  in January 2004 (see Subsequent Events).     22                 In March  2000, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $50 million of our common stock in the  open market. For each share of our stock repurchased, an equal number of our Operating Partnership units  are redeemed. In February 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the expansion of the existing buyback  program to repurchase up to an additional $100 million of our common shares. As of December 31, 2003,  we had purchased, and the Operating Partnership had redeemed, approximately 7.1 million shares and units  for approximately $99.8 million. The December 2003 repurchase transaction was separately authorized  by the Board and does not count against the amount of buybacks authorized under the share buyback program.      Unsolicited Tender Offer               In the  fall of 2002, we received an unsolicited proposal from Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG) seeking to acquire  control of TCO. The proposal was subsequently revised. Thereafter, a tender offer was commenced by SPG  and later joined by a subsidiary of Westfield America Trust (Westfield). Our Board of Directors rejected  the proposal and recommended that the shareholders not tender their shares pursuant to SPGs and Westfields  tender offer. SPG filed suit against us to enjoin the voting of our Series B Non-participating Convertible  Preferred Stock based on a variety of legal theories. In October 2003, SPG and Westfield withdrew their  tender offer, and TCO and SPG mutually agreed to end the litigation. During 2003 we incurred approximately  $30.4 million in costs, in connection with the unsolicited tender offer and related litigation, offset  by insurance recoveries of $5.6 million. During 2002, $5.1 million of costs were incurred. No further  costs are expected to be incurred.     Other               In July  2003, May Company announced that it intends to divest 32 of its 86 Lord & Taylor stores, including  four at our centers. As May Companys press release outlined, the company has decided to exit certain  markets in the south and southwest including Florida, Texas, and Colorado. This impacts Cherry Creek,  International Plaza, Wellington Green, and Willow Bend. May had also announced in its press release  that it will continue to fulfill its obligations under existing documents to operate each store until  satisfactory arrangements can be negotiated to divest each location. We are continuing discussions with  May and expect that a mutually satisfactory and positive solution for each center will be found.               We previously  had investments in certain technology companies (MerchantWired and Fashionmall.com) for which charges  of $8.1 million and $1.9 million were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively,  when events and circumstances indicated their carrying amounts were not recoverable.              In October  2001, we committed to a restructuring of our development operations. A restructuring charge of $2.0  million was recorded primarily representing the cost of certain involuntary terminations of personnel.  Pursuant to the restructuring plan, 17 positions were eliminated within the development department.               Effective  January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133 Accounting for  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related amendments and interpretations, which  establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. The initial adoption of SFAS  133 resulted in a reduction to income of approximately $8.4 million as the cumulative effect of a change  in accounting principle and a reduction to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) of $0.8 million. These amounts  represented the transition adjustments necessary to mark our share of interest rate agreements to fair  value as of January 1, 2001.     Other Income               We have  certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues, recoveries from tenants, and revenues  from management, leasing, and development services, as summarized in the following table. While gains  on peripheral land sales in 2003 were less than in the prior year, we expect that 2004 gains on land  sales will be about $5 million. Interest income in 2002 decreased primarily due to the settlement of  a note receivable. Lease cancellation income is dependent on the overall economy and performance of  particular retailers in specific locations and is difficult to predict; prior to 2001, it had averaged  between $2 million and $4 million. 2003 lease cancellation income was unusually high due mostly to a  small number of tenants who shifted their business strategy and closed stores that had only recently  opened. In 2004, lease cancellation revenue is expected to be significantly lower than in 2003 and is  currently estimated to be approximately $5 million. Estimates regarding anticipated 2004 other income  are forward-looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ  materially, including but not limited to: (1) actual results of negotiations with tenants, counterparties,  and potential purchasers of peripheral land, and (2) timing of transactions.     23                  2003  2002  2001    Consolidated Businesses  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  Consolidated Businesses  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  Consolidated Businesses  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures    (Operating Partnership's share in millions)   Shopping center related revenues  $    15.5  $     3.0  $    12.5  $     2.7  $    10.3  $   1.8   Gains on peripheral land sales  1.8     7.1  0.4  4.6   Lease cancellation revenue  8.8  2.9  6.3  1.2  6.4  3.6   Interest income  1.3  0.1  1.2  0.2  4.3  0.4                            $    27.4  $     5.9  $    27.1  $     4.6  $    25.6  $   5.8                              (1)  Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.       Management, Leasing, and Development Services               In addition,  we provide property management, leasing, development, and other administrative services to centers owned  by the General Motors pension trusts, other third parties, and certain Taubman affiliates. In 2003,  2002, and 2001, revenues recognized related to these services, net of costs of providing the services,  were $2.7 million, $2.6 million, and $7.0 million, respectively. The amount in 2002 decreased from 2001  due to the acquisition of the interest in Sunvalley and the completion of a short-term contract. The  General Motors pension trusts contracts are cancelable with 90 days notice. Certain annual overhead  costs of between $3 million and $5 million allocated to these contracts would not be eliminated if they  were to be canceled or not renewed.     Subsequent Events              In January  2004, we completed a $347.5 million refinancing on Beverly Center. The 10-year mortgage loan carries  an all-in interest rate of 5.5%. Proceeds were used to pay off the $146 million 8.36% mortgage, $20  million of the Wellington construction loan, all of the outstanding balances on the lines of credit,  and transaction fees. The net impact of this financing is expected to be an increase in interest expense  of $2.7 million for 2004.              Also  in January 2004, we purchased the additional 30% ownership of Beverly Center from Sheldon Gordon and  the estate of E. Phillip Lyon. Consideration of approximately $11 million for this interest consisted  of $3.3 million in cash and 276,724 of newly issued partnership units valued at $27.50 per unit. The  price of the acquisition was determined pursuant to a 1988 option agreement between us and a partnership  controlled by Mr. Gordon and Mr. Lyon. We have carried the $11 million net exercise price as a liability  on our balance sheet. We already recognized 100% of the financial results of the center in our financial  statements.              In February  2004, the $66 million loan on Woodland was repaid by the joint venture partners. We used borrowings  under a line of credit for our 50% share of the repayment.              Also  in February 2004, we completed a $145 million refinancing, secured by a mortgage on Dolphin Mall. The  loan matures in February 2006 and may be extended for a total of three years. The loan bears interest  at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.15%. The payment of principal and interest is guaranteed 100% by TRG. Proceeds  from the financing were used to repay the existing $142 million loan.              Subsequent  to these financings, 74% of our debt was fixed rate and 26% was floating, not including the impact of  hedge instruments.     Application of Critical Accounting Policies               The  preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the  United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial  statements and disclosures. Some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult,  subjective, and/or complex judgment, often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and that may change in subsequent periods. We are required to make such estimates and assumptions when  applying the following accounting policies.     24        Valuation of Shopping Centers               All  properties, including those under construction and/or owned by joint ventures, are reviewed for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment  would be recognized when the sum of expected cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges)  is less than the carrying value of the property. The expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent  on estimates and other factors subject to change, including (1) changes in the national, regional, and/or  local economic climates, (2) competition from other shopping centers, stores, clubs, mailings, and the  internet, (3) increases in operating costs, (4) bankruptcy and/or other changes in the condition of  third parties, including anchors and tenants, and (5) expected holding period. These factors could cause  our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change, and, as a result, an impairment could  be considered to have occurred. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the excess carrying value  of the property over its estimated fair value is charged against operations. There were no impairment  charges recognized in the periods covered within this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2003, the consolidated  net book value of our properties was $2.1 billion, representing over 90% of our consolidated assets.  We also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures with a  total combined net book value of $0.9 billion. These amounts include certain development costs that  are described in the policy that follows.     Capitalization of Development Costs               In developing  shopping centers, we typically obtain land or land options, zoning and regulatory approvals, anchor  commitments, and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which  we may incur significant costs. We capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that  a project will reach a successful conclusion. Prior to this time, we expense all costs relating to a  potential development, including payroll, and include these costs in Funds from Operations (refer to  Presentation of Operating Results).              Many  factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control, including (1) changes in the  national, regional, and/or local economic climates, (2) competition from other shopping centers, stores,  clubs, mailings, and the internet, (3) availability and cost of financing, (4) changes in regulations,  laws, and zoning, and (5) decisions made by third parties, including anchors. These factors could cause  our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change.  If a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion, a charge  against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur.              Our  approximately $34.2 million balance of development pre-construction costs as of December 31, 2003 consists  of costs relating to our Oyster Bay project in Syosset, New York. Refer to Planned Capital Spending  regarding the status of this project.     Valuation of Accounts Receivable              Rents  and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income; they represent over 90% of our  revenues. In generating this income, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. The  collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies, changes in the economy, and the ability  of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements. While we estimate potentially uncollectible  receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those  estimates. Also, if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement, receivable  balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations. Bad debt expense  was approximately 1% of total revenues in 2003, while bankruptcy filings affected 2.3% of tenant leases  during the year. Since 1991, the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than  2% of annual revenues.     Valuations for Acquired Property and Intangibles                Upon  acquisition of an investment property, including that of an additional interest in an asset already  partially owned, we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired.  These assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based  on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly  accepted valuation techniques. The estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect  the historical operations of the property, known trends and changes expected in current market and economic  conditions which would impact the propertys operations, and our plans for such property. These estimates  of cash flows and valuations are particularly important given the application of SFAS 141 and 142 for  the allocation of purchase price between land, buildings and improvements, and other identifiable intangibles.      25        New Accounting Pronouncements               In May  2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics  of both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150). This Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies  and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS  150 is currently effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and  otherwise was effective for us on July 1, 2003. The provisions of SFAS 150 had no impact on our financial  statements.              In January  2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46).  This Interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities  and the conditions under which they should be included in consolidated financial statements. FIN 46  is effective for the first interim or annual period ending after December 15, 2003. In December 2003,  the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46R (FIN 46R), which served to clarify guidance in FIN 46, and provided  additional guidance surrounding the application of FIN 46. We adopted the provisions of FIN 46R during  the fourth quarter of 2003, evaluating the equity-at-risk and other characteristics of our financial  interests in our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. The adoption did not change the entities  that we currently consolidate in our financial statements.     Presentation of Operating Results               The  following tables contain the operating results of our Consolidated Businesses and the Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures. Income allocated to the minority partners in the Operating Partnership and preferred  interests is deducted to arrive at the results allocable to our common shareowners. Because the net  equity of the Operating Partnership is less than zero, the income allocated to the minority partners  is equal to their share of distributions. The net equity of these minority partners is less than zero  due to accumulated distributions in excess of net income and not as a result of operating losses. Distributions  to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation  and amortization. Amounts allocable to minority partners in certain consolidated joint ventures are  added back or deducted to arrive at our net results. Our average ownership percentage of the Operating  Partnership was 60% in 2003 and 62% in both 2002 and 2001.              The  results of Dolphin Mall are presented within the Consolidated Businesses subsequent to its October 2002  acquisition. Prior to that date, they are included within the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.               In December  2003, we sold our interest in Biltmore Fashion Park. The results of Biltmore Fashion Park and the results  of La Cumbre Plaza and Paseo Nuevo, including the gains on their disposition in 2002, are presented  as discontinued operations.              The  operating results in the following tables include the supplemental earnings measures of Beneficial Interest  in EBITDA and Funds from Operations (FFO). Beneficial Interest in EBITDA represents the Operating Partnerships  share of the earnings before interest and depreciation and amortization, excluding gains on sales of  depreciated operating properties of its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. We believe Beneficial  Interest in EBITDA provides a useful indicator of operating performance, as it is customary in the real  estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected  by capital structure.              The  National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed  in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from  extraordinary items and sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments  for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure  of operating performance for REITs. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes  that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead  have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we and most industry investors and analysts  have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful  in evaluating the operating performance of REITs. We primarily use FFO in measuring performance and  in formulating corporate goals and compensation. Our presentation of FFO is not necessarily comparable  to the FFO of other REITs due to the fact that not all REITs use the NAREIT definition. FFO should not  be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance. Additionally,  FFO does not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by GAAP.      26        Comparison of 2003 to 2002               The  following table sets forth operating results for 2003 and 2002, showing the results of the Consolidated  Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:             2003  2002         CONSOLIDATED BUSINESSES  UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100%  (1)  CONSOLIDATED BUSINESSES  UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100%  (1)         (in millions of dollars)   REVENUES:                        Minimum rents     207.5   200.0   185.4   185.2      Percentage rents     4.8   3.7   4.4   3.5      Expense recoveries     125.6   103.9   114.6   94.2      Management, leasing and development     22.1     22.7      Other     28.4   12.4   29.1   9.2                      Total revenues     388.5   320.0   356.2   292.1         OPERATING COSTS:        Recoverable expenses     111.5   87.8   100.8   81.6      Other operating     37.1   22.6   31.6   23.1      Charges related to technology investments         8.1      Costs related to unsolicited tender offer, net of          recoveries     24.8     5.1      Management, leasing and development     19.4     20.0      General and administrative     24.6     20.6      Interest expense     84.2   82.7   77.5   77.0      Depreciation and amortization (2)     92.3   55.8   78.4   57.0                      Total operating costs     393.9   248.9   342.1   238.7                            (5.4  )  71.1   14.1   53.4                     Equity in income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures (2)     36.7     27.9                Income before discontinued operations and minority        and preferred interests     31.3     42.0    Discontinued operations:        Gains on dispositions of interests in centers     49.6     12.3      EBITDA     10.4     12.9      Interest expense     (5.9  )    (6.2  )     Depreciation and amortization     (3.2  )    (5.2  )   Minority and preferred interests:        TRG preferred distributions     (9.0  )    (9.0  )     Minority share of consolidated joint ventures     0.2     0.4      Minority share of income of TRG     (28.2  )    (17.4  )     Distributions in excess of minority share of income     (7.3  )    (15.4  )               Net income     37.8     14.4    Series A preferred dividends     (16.6  )    (16.6  )               Net income (loss) allocable to common shareowners     21.2     (2.2  )                    SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:        EBITDA - 100%  (3)     181.5   209.6   182.8   187.4      EBITDA - outside partners' share     (4.0  )  (95.9  )  (8.6  )  (83.4  )                       Beneficial interest in EBITDA  (3)     177.6   113.7   174.3   104.0      Beneficial interest expense     (87.4  )  (43.3  )  (78.7  )  (39.4  )     Non-real estate depreciation     (2.5  )    (2.7  )     Preferred dividends and distributions     (25.6  )    (25.6  )                       Funds from Operations contribution  (3)     62.1   70.4   67.3   64.6                           (1)  With the exception of the Supplemental Information, amounts include 100% of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Amounts are net of intercompany transactions. The Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented at 100% in order to allow for measurement of their performance as a whole, without regard to our ownership interest. In our consolidated financial statements, we account for investments in the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures under the equity method.         (2)  Amortization of our additional basis in the Operating Partnership included in equity in income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $3.0 million in both 2003 and 2002. Also, amortization of the additional basis included in depreciation and amortization was $4.2 million and $4.3 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.         (3)  For the year ended December 31, 2002, EBITDA and FFO were restated from amounts previously reported to include costs related to the unsolicited tender offer of $5.1 million and charges related to technology investments of $8.1 million recognized during 2002 and previously excluded from EBITDA and FFO.         (4)  Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year information to conform to current year classifications.       27        Consolidated Businesses              Total  revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $388.5 million, a $32.3 million or 9.1% increase  over 2002. Minimum rents increased $22.1 million, primarily due to the consolidation of Dolphin Mall  and the opening of Stony Point. Minimum rents also increased due to increased average occupancy and  income from temporary tenants and specialty retailers. Expense recoveries increased due to related recoverable  expenses. The increase in expense recoveries was partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease as a result  of a property tax credit at a certain center. Other revenue decreased by $0.7 million from 2002 primarily  due to a decrease in gains on sales of peripheral land, partially offset by an increase in lease cancellation  revenue.              Total  operating costs were $393.9 million, a $51.8 million or 15.1% increase over the comparable period in  2002. Recoverable expenses increased primarily due to Dolphin Mall, partially offset by a $4.9 million  property tax credit at one of the centers. Other operating expense increased due to increases in property  management costs and bad debt expense, partially offset by a decrease in the charge to operations for  pre-development activities. During 2003, $24.8 million in costs, net of insurance recoveries, were incurred  in connection with the unsolicited tender offer. During 2002, write-offs of technology investments of  $8.1 million were recognized. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to deferred  bonus expense based on our stock price and higher insurance costs. Interest expense increased primarily  due to the consolidation of Dolphin Mall, increased debt and decreased capitalized interest upon opening  of Stony Point, and increases due to the hedging of certain floating rate debt, partially offset by  decreases due to the lower floating rates and paydown of debt from the proceeds of the sale of La Cumbre  Plaza and Paseo Nuevo. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to the acquisition of the additional  interest in Dolphin Mall and the opening of Stony Point.     Unconsolidated Joint Ventures              Total  revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $320.0 million, a $27.9 million or 9.6% increase  from 2002. Minimum rents increased $14.8 million, primarily due to Millenia and the acquisition of the  interest in Sunvalley, partially offset by a decrease due to the transfer of Dolphin Mall to the Consolidated  Businesses. Minimum rents also increased due to increased average occupancy, tenant rollovers, and income  from temporary tenants and specialty retailers. Expense recoveries increased primarily due to Millenia  and Sunvalley, partially offset by the transfer of Dolphin Mall. Other revenue increased primarily due  to an increase in lease cancellation revenue, partially offset by a decrease in gains on sales of peripheral  land.              Total  operating costs increased by $10.2 million to $248.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Recoverable  expenses increased primarily due to Millenia and Sunvalley, partially offset by the transfer of Dolphin  Mall. Recoverable expenses in 2002 included the reversal of a $2.8 million special assessment tax accrued  during 2001. Other operating expense decreased due to the transfer of Dolphin Mall and charges for development  activities incurred during 2002, partially offset by Millenia and Sunvalley. Interest expense increased  due to the Sunvalley acquisition and refinancing and increased debt and decreased capitalized interest  upon opening of Millenia. These increases were partially offset by a decrease due to the transfer of  Dolphin Mall. Depreciation expense decreased due to the transfer of Dolphin Mall, partially offset by  Millenia and Sunvalley.              As a  result of the foregoing, income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures increased by $17.7 million to $71.1  million. Our equity in income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $36.7 million, an $8.8 million  increase from 2002.     Net Income               As a  result of the foregoing, our income before discontinued operations and minority and preferred interests  decreased by $10.7 million to $31.3 million for 2003. Discontinued operations in 2003 included a $49.6  million gain on the disposition of Biltmore and adjustments to prior gains, while 2002 included $12.3  million of gains on the dispositions of La Cumbre Plaza and Paseo Nuevo. After allocation of income  to minority and preferred interests, the net income (loss) allocable to common shareowners for 2003  was $21.2 million compared to $(2.2) million in 2002.     28        Comparison of 2002 to 2001              The  following table sets forth operating results for 2002 and 2001, showing the results of the Consolidated  Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:             2002  2001         CONSOLIDATED BUSINESSES  UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100%  (1)  CONSOLIDATED BUSINESSES  UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100%  (1)         (in millions of dollars)   REVENUES:                        Minimum rents     185.4   185.2   156.0   149.3      Percentage rents     4.4   3.5   4.8   3.2      Expense recoveries     114.6   94.2   95.6   73.6      Management, leasing and development     22.7     26.0      Other     29.1   9.2   26.9   12.3                      Total revenues     356.2   292.1   309.3   238.4         OPERATING COSTS:        Recoverable expenses     100.8   81.6   82.5   67.3      Other operating     31.6   23.1   31.3   15.1      Restructuring loss         2.0      Charges related to technology investments     8.1     1.9      Costs related to unsolicited tender offer     5.1      Management, leasing and development     20.0     19.0      General and administrative     20.6     20.1      Interest expense     77.5   77.0   62.0   75.0      Depreciation and amortization  (2)     78.4   57.0   61.0   39.3                      Total operating costs     342.1   238.7   279.7   196.7                            14.1   53.4   29.6   41.8         Equity in income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  (2)(3)     27.9     21.9                Income before discontinued operations, cumulative        effect of change in accounting principle, and minority        and preferred interests     42.0     51.5    Discontinued operations:        Gains on dispositions of interests in centers     12.3      EBITDA     12.9     18.3      Interest expense     (6.2  )    (6.2  )     Depreciation and amortization     (5.2  )    (7.9  )   Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle         (8.4  )   Minority and preferred interests:        TRG preferred distributions     (9.0  )    (9.0  )     Minority share of consolidated joint ventures     0.4     1.1      Minority share of income of TRG     (17.4  )    (11.7  )     Distributions in excess of minority share of income     (15.4  )    (20.0  )               Net income     14.4     7.7    Series A preferred dividends     (16.6  )    (16.6  )               Net loss allocable to common shareowners     (2.2  )    (8.9  )                    SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:        EBITDA - 100%  (4)     182.8   187.4   170.8   156.0      EBITDA - outside partners' share     (8.6  )  (83.4  )  (7.5  )  (71.6  )                       Beneficial interest in EBITDA  (4)     174.3   104.0   163.3   84.4      Beneficial interest expense     (78.7  )  (39.4  )  (63.2  )  (38.7  )     Non-real estate depreciation     (2.7  )    (2.7  )     Preferred dividends and distributions     (25.6  )    (25.6  )                       Funds from Operations contribution  (4)     67.3   64.6   71.9   45.7                           (1)  With the exception of the Supplemental Information, amounts include 100% of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Amounts are net of intercompany transactions. The Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented at 100% in order to allow for measurement of their performance as a whole, without regard to our ownership interest. In our consolidated financial statements, we account for investments in the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures under the equity method.         (2)  Amortization of our additional basis in the Operating Partnership included in equity in income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $3.0 million in both 2002 and 2001. Also, amortization of the additional basis included in depreciation and amortization was $4.3 million in 2002 and $4.4 million in 2001.         (3)  Equity in income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures excludes the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle incurred in connection with our adoption of SFAS 133 in 2001. Our share of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures cumulative effect was approximately $1.6 million.         (4)  For the year ended December 31, 2002, EBITDA and FFO were restated from amounts previously reported to include costs related to the unsolicited tender offer of $5.1 million and charges related to technology investments of $8.1 million recognized during 2002 and previously excluded from EBITDA and FFO. For the year ended December 31, 2001, EBITDA and FFO were restated from amounts previously reported to include a charge related to a technology investment of $1.9 million recognized during 2001 and previously excluded from EBITDA and FFO.         (5)   Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year information to conform to current year classifications.       29        Consolidated Businesses               Total  revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $356.2 million, a $46.9 million or 15.2% increase  over 2001. Minimum rents increased $29.4 million, of which $24.6 million was due to the openings of  The Shops at Willow Bend and The Mall at Wellington Green and the consolidation of Dolphin Mall after  the acquisition of the additional interest. Minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers and  increases in occupancy. Expense recoveries increased primarily due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green,  and the inclusion of Dolphin Mall. Management, leasing, and development revenue decreased primarily  due to the loss of Sunvalley revenue due to its acquisition, and the completion of a short-term contract.  Other revenue increased due to increases in gains on sales of peripheral land and income from sponsorship  and other retail initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in interest income.              Total  operating costs were $342.1 million, a $62.4 million or 22.3% increase over the comparable period in  2001. Recoverable expenses increased primarily due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green, and the inclusion  of Dolphin Mall. Other operating expense increased primarily due to the new centers, partially offset  by decreases in MerchantWired losses and bad debt expense. During 2001, a $2.0 million restructuring  loss was recognized, which primarily represented the cost of certain involuntary terminations of personnel.  Write-offs and/or write-downs of technology investments of $8.1 million and $1.9 million were recognized  in 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, $5.1 million in costs were incurred in connection with  the unsolicited tender offer. Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in debt and a  decrease in capitalized interest upon opening of Willow Bend and Wellington Green, as well as the change  in ownership of Dolphin Mall, partially offset by decreases due to lower rates on floating rate debt  and the paydown of debt from the proceeds of the sale of La Cumbre Plaza and Paseo Nuevo. Depreciation  expense increased primarily due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green, and Dolphin Mall.     Unconsolidated Joint Ventures              Total  revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $292.1 million, a $53.7 million or 22.5% increase  from 2001. Minimum rents increased $35.9 million, of which $34.5 million was due to International Plaza,  the Mall at Millenia, the acquisition of the interest in Sunvalley, and Dolphin Mall prior to the acquisition  of the additional interest. Minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers and increases in occupancy.  Expense recoveries increased primarily due to International Plaza, Millenia, and Sunvalley. Other revenue  decreased primarily due to a decrease in lease cancellation revenue, partially offset by increases in  gains on sales of peripheral land and income from sponsorship and other retail initiatives.              Total  operating costs increased by $42.0 million to $238.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Recoverable  expenses increased primarily due to International Plaza, Millenia, and Sunvalley. Recoverable expenses  in 2002 included the reversal of a $2.8 million special assessment tax accrued during 2001. Other operating  expense increased primarily due to these new centers and charges for costs of development activities.  Interest expense increased due to the Sunvalley acquisition, increased debt and decreased capitalized  interest upon opening of International Plaza and Millenia, partially offset by a decrease in the liability  for the Dolphin Mall swap agreement recorded under SFAS 133 and lower rates on floating rate debt. Depreciation  expense increased primarily due to International Plaza, Millenia, and Sunvalley.              As a  result of the foregoing, income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures increased by $11.6 million to $53.4  million. Our equity in income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $27.9 million, a $6.0 million  increase from the comparable period in 2001.     Net Income               As a  result of the foregoing, our income before discontinued operations, cumulative effect of change in accounting  principle, and minority and preferred interests decreased $9.5 million to $42.0 million for the year  ended December 31, 2002. The discontinued operations of Biltmore, La Cumbre Plaza, and Paseo Nuevo include  a $12.3 million gain on the dispositions of La Cumbre Plaza and Paseo Nuevo in 2002. In 2001, a cumulative  effect of a change in accounting principle of $8.4 million was recognized in connection with our adoption  of SFAS 133. After allocation of income to minority and preferred interests, the net loss allocable  to common shareowners for 2002 was $(2.2) million compared to $(8.9) million in 2001.     30        Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Funds from  Operations            2003  2002  2001    (in millions of dollars)   Net income (loss) allocable to common shareowners     21.2   (2.2  )  (8.9  )        Add (less) depreciation and gains on dispositions of properties:           Gains on dispositions of interests in centers     (49.6  )  (12.3  )        Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle         8.4         Depreciation and amortization  (1) :               Consolidated businesses at 100%     92.3   78.4   61.0             Minority partners in consolidated joint ventures     (1.4  )  (4.0  )  (3.6  )            Discontinued operations     3.2   5.2   7.9             Share of unconsolidated joint ventures     33.6   36.7   23.9             Non-real estate depreciation     (2.5  )  (2.7  )  (2.7  )        Add minority interests in TRG:           Minority share of income in TRG     28.2   17.4   11.7         Distributions in excess of minority share of income of TRG     7.3   15.4   20.0                       Funds from Operations - TRG  (2)     132.5   131.8   117.6                  Funds from Operations - TCO  (2)     80.0   81.6   72.3                       (1)  Depreciation includes $6.5 million and $5.2 million of mall tenant allowance amortization for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.         (2)   TRGs FFO for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes costs, net of insurance recoveries, of $24.8 million incurred in connection with the unsolicited tender offer. TRGs FFO for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes costs of $5.1 million incurred in connection with the unsolicited tender offer. TRGs FFO for the year ended December 31, 2002 was restated from previously reported amounts to include these costs related to the unsolicited tender offer, previously excluded from FFO. FFO for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 was also restated to include charges related to technology investments of $8.1 million and $1.9 million recognized during 2002 and 2001, respectively, and previously excluded from FFO. TCOs share of TRGs FFO is based on an average ownership of 60% and 62% during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

We do not have, and have not  had, any parent company indebtedness; all debt discussed represents obligations of the Operating Partnership  or its subsidiaries and joint ventures.              Capital  resources are required to maintain our current operations, complete construction underway, pay dividends,  and fund planned capital spending for future developments and other commitments and contingencies. We  believe that our net cash provided by operating activities, distributions from our joint ventures, the  unutilized portions of our credit facilities, and our ability to access the capital markets assure adequate  liquidity to meet current and future cash requirements and will allow us to conduct our operations in  accordance with our dividend and financing policies. The following sections contain information regarding  our recent capital transactions and sources and uses of cash; beneficial interest in debt and sensitivity  to interest rate risk; and historical capital spending. We then provide information regarding our anticipated  future capital spending; covenants, commitments, and contingencies; and dividend policies.     Summaries of 2003 Capital Activities and Transactions               As of  December 31, 2003, we had a consolidated cash balance of $30.4 million. Additionally, we have a secured  $275 million line of credit. This line had $150.0 million of borrowings as of December 31, 2003 and  expires in November 2004 with a one-year extension option. We also have available a second secured bank  line of credit of up to $40 million. This line had $10.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2003  and expires in November 2004. See Subsequent Events regarding repayment of the balances under these  lines of credit in January 2004.              During  2003, we sold Biltmore Fashion Park, acquired additional interests in MacArthur Center and Great Lakes  Crossing as well as an interest in Waterside Shops at Pelican Bay, completed and opened Stony Point  Fashion Park, and began construction on Northlake Mall. Additionally, financings of approximately $525  million were completed relating to The Shops at Willow Bend, The Mall at Millenia, and Great Lakes Crossing,  and $50 million was invested into our Operating Partnership by an affiliate. An additional $5.2 million  was invested in the Operating Partnership as part of our purchase of the additional interest in MacArthur  Center. In total we have issued $55.2 million in equity at an average price of $24.29 per share. Also  during 2003, we purchased approximately 3 million shares under our share repurchase program at an average  price of $17.75 and completed a 1.6 million partnership unit redemption as part of the Biltmore sale,  at a price of $18.53. The total of these equity transactions resulted in a reduction of 2.3 million  shares at a net cost of $11.91 per share. These transactions are more fully described in Results of  Operations.     32        Operating Activities               Our  net cash provided by operating activities was $133.5 million in 2003, compared to $142.5 million in  2002 and $120.5 million in 2001. In 2003, increases in cash from a full year of operations at The Mall  at Millenia, increases in average rents per square foot, lease cancellation revenue, and net recoveries,  and additional operating cash flows due to the opening of Stony Point Fashion Park in September were  offset by cash spent in connection with the unsolicited tender offer. In 2002, cash provided by operating  activities increased from 2001 primarily due to the full year of operating cash flow provided by the  new centers opening throughout 2001.     Investing Activities              Net  cash used in investing activities was $41.7 million in 2003 compared to $28.0 million provided in 2002  and $240.7 million used in 2001.              Cash  used in investing activities was impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, with additions to properties  and/or contributions to joint ventures in 2003, 2002, and 2001 for the construction of Dolphin Mall,  International Plaza, The Mall at Millenia, Northlake Mall, Stony Point Fashion Park, The Mall at Wellington  Green, and The Shops at Willow Bend, as well as other development activities and other capital items.  A tabular presentation of 2003 capital spending is shown in Capital Spending. Additionally, $30.3 million  was used in 2003 to acquire interests in Waterside Shops at Pelican Bay, MacArthur Center, and Great  Lakes Crossing, while $42.2 million was used in 2002 in connection with acquiring interests in Arizona  Mills, Dolphin Mall, and Sunvalley.              Sources  of cash used in funding these investing activities included sales of interests in centers and distributions  from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, as well as the financing activities described in the next section.  In 2003, the sale of Biltmore provided $51.0 million, while the 2002 sales of Paseo Nuevo and La Cumbre  Plaza provided $76.4 million. Distributions in excess of earnings from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  provided $49.1 million in 2003, $86.4 million in 2002, and $18.3 million in 2001. In 2003, these distributions  included $21.0 million of excess proceeds from the March 2003 refinancing of The Mall at Millenia, while  in 2002 $36.8 million of excess proceeds were received from the Westfarms refinancing and $25.9 million  was repaid to us from borrowings under the Dolphin construction loan. Net proceeds from sales of peripheral  land were $5.7 million, $13.3 million, and $8.6 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The timing  of land sales is variable and proceeds from land sales can vary significantly from period to period.               Cash  used in or provided by investing activities is also affected by certain infrequently occurring or peripheral  activities. During 2002 and 2001, $4.1 million and $4.0 million were invested in technology-related  ventures, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, there were no investments in or obligations relating  to technology-related ventures. Dividends received from investments in technology companies were $0.4  million and $3.1 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.     Financing Activities               Net  cash used in financing activities was $93.8 million in 2003, compared to $164.9 million of cash used  in 2002, and $128.8 million of cash provided in 2001.              Net  cash used in or provided by financing activities was primarily impacted by cash requirements of the  investing activities described in the preceding section. Proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of  payments and issuance costs, were $20.6 million in 2003, compared to net repayments of $70.9 million  in 2002 and net borrowings of $242.7 million in 2001. In 2003, we used $50 million from the issuance  of partnership units to fund repurchases of our common stock. These repurchases totaled $52.8 million  in 2003. Stock repurchases of $22.9 million were made in connection with our stock repurchase program  in 2001. Issuance of stock pursuant to the Continuing Offer related to the exercise of employee options  contributed $2.3 million in 2003, $16.4 million in 2002, and $16.9 million in 2001. Total dividends  and distributions paid were $113.9 million, $110.3 million, and $107.9 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001,  respectively.     33        Beneficial Interest in Debt              At December  31, 2003, the Operating Partnerships debt and its beneficial interest in the debt of its Consolidated  and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures totaled $2,162.1 million with an average interest rate of 5.76% excluding  amortization of debt issuance costs and the effects of interest rate hedging instruments. These costs  are reported as interest expense in the results of operations. Recognition of these costs added 0.31%  to TRGs effective interest rate during 2003. Included in beneficial interest in debt is debt used to  fund development and expansion costs. Beneficial interest in assets on which interest is being capitalized  totaled $70.1 million as of December 31, 2003. Beneficial interest in capitalized interest was $9.0  million for 2003. The following table presents information about our beneficial interest in debt as  of December 31, 2003 (amounts may not add due to rounding):              Amount  Interest Rate Including Spread  LIBOR Lock/ Swap Rate               (in millions of dollars)       Fixed rate debt     1,447.7   6.67  %  (1)                 Floating rate debt:          Swapped through June 2004     100.0   5.31   (1)   4.13  %       Swapped through September 2004     100.0   6.20     4.35   (2)        Swapped through September 2004     120.0   4.30       2.05        Floating month to month     394.4   2.85   (1)              Total floating rate debt     714.4   3.90   (1)                   Total beneficial interest in debt     2,162.1   5.76  %  (1)                   Amortization of financing costs  (3)         0.31  %                      Average all-in rate         6.07  %                           (1)   Represents weighted average interest rate before amortization of financing costs.         (2)   This debt is also swapped from October 2004 through April 2005 at 5.25%.         (3)   Financing costs include financing fees, interest rate cap premiums, and losses on settlement of derivatives used to hedge the refinancing of certain fixed rate debt.                In addition,  as of December 31, 2003, $186.7 million of our beneficial interest in floating rate debt is covered  under interest rate cap agreements with LIBOR cap rates ranging from 4.6% to 8.2% with terms ending  August 2004 through July 2006.     Subsequent Events              Refer  to Results of Operations regarding the 2004 refinancings of Beverly Center and Dolphin Mall, and the  repayment of Woodlands mortgage debt.     Sensitivity Analysis               We have  exposure to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and interest rate instruments. We use derivative  instruments primarily to manage exposure to interest rate risks inherent in variable rate debt and refinancings.  We routinely use cap, swap, and treasury lock agreements to meet these objectives. Based on the Operating  Partnerships beneficial interest in floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2003, excluding debt  fixed under interest rate swaps, a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates on this floating  rate debt would decrease or increase cash flows by approximately $4.7 million and, due to the effect  of capitalized interest, annual earnings by approximately $4.5 million. Based on our consolidated debt  and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2003, a one percent increase in interest rates would decrease  the fair value of debt by approximately $35.1 million, while a one percent decrease in interest rates  would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $37.5 million.     34        Contractual Obligations               In conducting  our business, we enter into various contractual obligations, including those for debt, capital leases  for property improvements, operating leases for office space and land, purchase obligations (primarily  for construction), and other long-term commitments. Detail of these obligations for our consolidated  businesses, including expected settlement periods, is contained below:              Payments due by period         Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  More than 5 years                     (in millions of dollars)   Debt  (1) :                            Lines of credit     160.5   160.5  (2)       Property level debt     1,335.3   451.7  (2)  250.0   21.3   612.2    Capital lease obligations     9.1   2.6   4.2   2.4    Operating leases     134.0   7.0   8.0   6.1   113.0    Purchase obligations:        Planned capital spending  (3)     156.0   111.8   44.2      Other purchase obligations  (4)     8.4   2.9   3.1   1.3   1.2    Other long-term liabilities  (5)     98.7   10.6   13.6   6.2   68.4                          Total     1,902.0   747.1   323.1   37.3   794.8                               (1)   The settlement periods for debt do not consider extension options.         (2)   Of this amount, $468.8 million has already been paid in 2004 through refinancings of Beverly Center and Dolphin Mall. The new $347.5 million loan on Beverly Center matures in 2014. The new $145 million loan on Dolphin Mall matures in 2006 and can be extended for a total of three years. The remaining property level debt consists of amortization of mortgage principal payments and the balance on The Mall at Wellington Green loan. This loan can be extended a total of two years. Proceeds from the Beverly Center refinancing in the first quarter of 2004 were used to completely pay down the existing lines of credit.         (3)   As of December 31, 2003, we were contractually liable for $9.7 million of this planned spending. See Planned Capital Spending for detail regarding planned funding.         (4)   Excludes purchase agreements with cancellation provisions of 90 days or less.         (5)   Other long-term liabilities consist of various accrued liabilities, most significantly assessment bond obligations and long-term incentive compensation.         (6)   Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.       Loan Commitments and Guarantees               Certain  loan agreements contain various restrictive covenants, including minimum net worth requirements, minimum  debt service and fixed charges coverage ratios, a maximum payout ratio on distributions, a minimum debt  yield ratio, and a leverage ratio, the latter two being the most restrictive. The Operating Partnership  is in compliance with all of its covenants.              Certain  debt agreements, including all construction facilities, contain performance and valuation criteria that  must be met for the loans to be extended at the full principal amounts; these agreements provide for  partial prepayments of debt to facilitate compliance with extension provisions. A partial prepayment  on the Wellington construction loan was made in January 2004 in anticipation of the loan extension in  May 2004.              Payments  of principal and interest on the loans in the following table are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership  as of December 31, 2003. The Stony Point Fashion Park and The Mall at Wellington Green loan agreements  provide for a reduction of the amounts guaranteed as certain center performance and valuation criteria  are met.     35                 Center  Loan balance as of 12/31/03  TRG's beneficial interest in loan balance as of 12/31/03  Amount of  loan balance guaranteed by TRG as of 12/31/03  % of loan balance guaranteed by TRG  % of interest guaranteed by TRG                       (in millions of dollars)     Dolphin Mall     142.3   142.3   71.2   50  %  100  %  (1)      Stony Point Fashion Park     74.8   74.8   74.8   100     100     (2)    The Mall at Millenia        term loan     2.3   1.2   1.2   50     50      The Mall at Millenia        revolving loan     0.4   0.2   0.2   50     50      The Mall at Wellington Green     150.6       (3)  135.6   150.6   100     100      The Shops at Willow Bend     149.1   149.1   149.1   100     100      The Shops at Willow Bend         land loan     11.4   11.4   11.4   100     100           (1)   The Dolphin Mall loan was refinanced in February 2004 with a $145 million recourse loan. TRGs guaranty on the new loan is 100% of principal and interest.         (2)   Effective February 2004, TRGs guaranty on the Stony Point loan balance and interest was decreased to 20%.         (3)   Excess financing proceeds from the Beverly refinancing in January 2004 were used to pay down $20 million on the Wellington loan (see Results of Operations  Subsequent Events).       Cash Tender Agreement               A. Alfred  Taubman has the annual right to tender to us units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership  (provided that the aggregate value is at least $50 million) and cause us to purchase the tendered interests  at a purchase price based on a market valuation of TCO on the trading date immediately preceding the  date of the tender (the Cash Tender Agreement). At A. Alfred Taubmans election, his family, and certain  others may participate in tenders. We will have the option to pay for these interests from available  cash, borrowed funds, or from the proceeds of an offering of our common stock. Generally, we expect  to finance these purchases through the sale of new shares of our stock. The tendering partner will bear  all market risk if the market price at closing is less than the purchase price and will bear the costs  of sale. Any proceeds of the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of  TCO.              Based  on a market value at December 31, 2003 of $20.60 per common share, the aggregate value of interests  in the Operating Partnership that may be tendered under the Cash Tender Agreement was approximately  $509 million. The purchase of these interests at December 31, 2003 would have resulted in our owning  an additional 30% interest in the Operating Partnership.     Capital Spending               Capital  spending for routine maintenance of the shopping centers is generally recovered from tenants. Capital  spending during 2003 not recovered from tenants is summarized in the following table:             2003  (1)         Consolidated Businesses  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  Beneficial interest in Consolidated Businesses  Beneficial interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures         (in millions of dollars)   Development, renovation, and expansion:                         Existing centers     3.3   2.4   3.2   1.2       New centers     100.7  (2)  (0.1  )  100.2  (2)  (0.2  )   Pre-construction development activities,        net of charge to operations     4.3     4.3    Mall tenant allowances  (3)     6.8   6.8   6.6   3.1    Corporate office improvements and        equipment     2.0     2.0    Other     1.2   0.7   1.2   0.4                      Total     118.2   9.7   117.6   4.5                           (1)   Costs are net of intercompany profits and are computed on an accrual basis.         (2)   Primarily includes costs related to Northlake Mall and Stony Point Fashion Park.        (3)   Excludes initial tenant allowances on the non-stabilized centers.         (4)   Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.       36                 For  the year ended December 31, 2003, in addition to the costs above, we incurred our $9.0 million share  of capitalized leasing costs and our $12.9 million share of Consolidated Businesses' and $1.3 million  share of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures' repair and asset replacement costs that will be reimbursed by  tenants. Also during this period, our share of reimbursements by tenants for capitalizable expenditures  of prior periods was $6.2 million for Consolidated Businesses and $2.8 million for Unconsolidated Joint  Ventures. The expenditures reimbursable by the tenants and the related reimbursements are classified  as recoverable expenses and expense recoveries, respectively, and both are included in our Funds from  Operations.              The  following table presents a reconciliation of the Consolidated Businesses capital spending shown above  to cash additions to properties as presented in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year  ended December 31, 2003:          (in millions of dollars)                Consolidated Businesses' capital spending not recovered from tenants     118.2    Repair and asset replacement costs reimbursable by tenants     13.1    Repair and asset replacement costs reimbursed by tenants     (6.3  )   Differences between cash and accrual basis     (8.6  )             Additions to properties     116.4                          Capital  spending during 2002 not recovered from tenants is summarized in the following table:             2002  (1)         Consolidated Businesses  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  Beneficial interest in Consolidated Businesses  Beneficial interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures         (in millions of dollars)   Development, renovation, and expansion:                         Existing centers     4.5   (1.6  )  4.5   (0.8  )      New centers     58.6  (2)  115.7  (3)  58.4  (2)  57.7  (3)   Pre-construction development activities,        net of charge to operations     7.9     7.9    Mall tenant allowances  (4)     7.7   13.3   7.3   6.7    Corporate office improvements and        equipment     2.2     2.0    Other     0.8   0.6   0.8   0.3                      Total     81.7   128.0   81.1   63.9                           (1)  Costs are net of intercompany profits and are computed on an accrual basis.         (2)   Primarily includes costs related to Stony Point Fashion Park.         (3)   Primarily includes costs related to The Mall at Millenia (a 50% owned unconsolidated joint venture).         (4)   Excludes initial tenant allowances for non-stabilized centers.         (5)   Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.                The  Operating Partnerships share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased during the year, excluding  expansion space and new developments, was $13.37 in 2003 and $18.18 in 2002. Excluding leased spaces  greater than 10,000 square feet, the mall tenant allowance per square foot leased in 2002 was $15.78.  In addition, the Operating Partnerships share of capitalized leasing and tenant coordination costs  in 2003, excluding new developments, was $9.0 million, or $11.75 per square foot leased. The Operating  Partnerships share of capitalized leasing and tenant coordination costs, excluding non-stabilized centers,  was $6.1 million in 2003 or $9.69 per square foot leased, and $7.5 million or $9.76 per square foot  leased, in 2002.     37        Planned Capital Spending              Northlake  Mall, a new 1.1 million square foot enclosed center in Charlotte, North Carolina, will be anchored by  Dillards, Hechts, Belk, Dicks Sporting Goods, and a theater complex. The center is scheduled to open  September 15, 2005 and is expected to cost approximately $175 million. We expect returns on this investment  to be approximately 11% at stabilization.              Future  construction costs for Northlake Mall will be funded through our existing credit facilities until construction  financing is obtained. The financing is expected to be completed in 2004.              Our  approximately $34.2 million balance of development pre-construction costs as of December 31, 2003 consists  of costs relating to our Oyster Bay project in Syosset, New York. Both Neiman Marcus and Lord &  Taylor have committed to the project and retailer interest has been very strong. Although we still need  to obtain the necessary entitlement approvals to move forward with the project, we are encouraged by  six straight court decisions in our favor. While the timing of decisions in the continuing litigation  process is uncertain, the entitlement litigation is likely to be resolved within a year. We expect continued  success with the ongoing litigation, and assuming we are able to begin construction in late 2004, we  would expect to open the center in late 2006. Weve exercised our option to acquire the land and expect  to make a payment of $16.6 million to close the transaction in April 2004. The amount of additional  spending on this project in 2004 is dependent upon the timing of resolution of the litigation and municipal  approvals.              The  following table summarizes planned capital spending, which is not recovered from tenants and assumes  no acquisitions during 2004:             2004  (1)         Consolidated Businesses  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  Beneficial interest in Consolidated Businesses  Beneficial interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures         (in millions of dollars)   Development, renovation, and expansion     71.9  (2)  0.3   71.9   0.1    Mall tenant allowances     12.1   7.5   11.8   3.4    Pre-construction development and other     11.2   0.5   11.2   0.3                           Total     95.2   8.3   94.9   3.8                                (1)   Costs are net of intercompany profits.         (2)   Primarily includes costs related to Northlake Mall. Excludes the land acquisition and other costs related to the Oyster Bay project described above.         (3)   Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.                The  Operating Partnership anticipates that its share of costs for development projects scheduled to be completed  in 2005 will be as much as $44 million in 2005. Estimates of future capital spending include only projects  approved by our Board of Directors and, consequently, estimates will change as new projects are approved.  We are currently exploring redevelopment opportunities at Waterside Shops at Pelican Bay. Potential  costs related to this project are excluded from the table above. Estimates regarding capital expenditures,  occupancy, and returns on new developments presented above are forward-looking statements and certain  significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to:  (1) actual results of negotiations with anchors, tenants, and contractors, (2) changes in the scope  and number of projects, (3) cost overruns, (4) timing of expenditures, (5) financing considerations,  (6) actual time to complete projects, (7) changes in economic climate, (8) competition from others attracting  tenants and customers, (9) increases in operating costs, (10) timing of tenant openings, and (11) early  lease terminations and bankruptcies.     Dividends               We pay  regular quarterly dividends to our common and Series A preferred shareowners. Dividends to our common  shareowners are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash available to us,  our financial condition, capital and other requirements, and such other factors as the Board of Directors  deems relevant. To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to  our shareowners, as well as meet certain other requirements. Preferred dividends accrue regardless of  whether earnings, cash availability, or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment  of dividends. The preferred stock became callable in October 2002. Although we have not committed to  refinance this equity, we are investigating various alternatives.     38                 On December  10, 2003, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per common share payable January 21, 2004 to shareowners  of record on December 31, 2003. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51875  per share on our 8.3% Series A Preferred Stock, paid December 31, 2003 to shareowners of record on December  19, 2003.              Dividends  declared on our common and preferred stock and their tax status are presented in the following tables:               Year  Dividends per common share declared  Return of capital  Ordinary income  20% Rate long term capital gain (Pre 5/06/03)  15% Rate long term capital gain (Post 5/05/03)  Unrecaptured Section 1250 capital gains                         2003     $1.050   $0.5054   $0.2567   $0.0076   $0.1401   $0.1402    2002     1.025   0.4417   0.3753   0.1498         0.0582               Year  Dividends per Series A preferred share declared  Ordinary income  20% Rate long term capital gain (Pre 5/06/03)  15% Rate long term capital gain (Post 5/05/03)  Unrecaptured Section 1250 capital gains                      2003     $2.075   $1.5060   $0.0149   $0.2770   $0.2771    2002     2.075   1.6540   0.3032       0.1178                The  portion of the dividends paid to common and preferred shareowners in 2003 for capital gains and unrecaptured  Section 1250 gains are designated as capital gain dividends for tax purposes. The tax status of total  2004 common dividends declared and to be declared, assuming continuation of a $0.27 per common share  quarterly dividend, is estimated to be approximately 39% return of capital, and approximately 61% ordinary  income. The tax status of total 2004 dividends to be paid on Series A Preferred Stock is estimated to  be 100% ordinary income. These are forward-looking statements and certain significant factors could  cause the actual results to differ materially, including: (1) the amount of dividends declared, (2)  changes in our share of anticipated taxable income of the Operating Partnership due to the actual results  of the Operating Partnership, (3) changes in the number of our outstanding shares, (4) property acquisitions  or dispositions, (5) financing transactions, including refinancing of existing debt, (6) changes in  interest rates, (7) amount and nature of development activities, and (8) changes in the tax laws or  their application.              The  annual determination of our common dividends is based on anticipated Funds from Operations available  after preferred dividends, as well as assessments of annual capital spending, financing considerations,  and other appropriate factors. Over the past several years, we have determined that the growth in common  dividends would be less than the growth in Funds from Operations. We expect to evaluate our policy and  the benefits of increasing dividends at a higher rate than historical increases, subject to our assessment  of cash requirements.              Any  inability of the Operating Partnership or its Joint Ventures to secure financing as required to fund  maturing debts, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, including development activities  and expansions, may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations, thereby possibly reducing  distributions to partners of the Operating Partnership and funds available to us for the payment of  dividends.
