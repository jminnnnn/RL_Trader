Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The  following  discussion  should  be read in  conjunction  with  Selected Financial  Data and the Financial  Statements of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. and the Notes thereto.  General Background and Performance Measurement       The  Company  owns a managing  general  partner's  interest  in The Taubman Realty Group Limited  Partnership  (the Operating  Partnership or TRG),  through which the Company  conducts all of its  operations.  The  Operating  Partnership owns, develops, acquires, and operates regional shopping centers nationally. The Consolidated  Businesses  consist of shopping  centers  that are  controlled  by ownership or contractual  agreement,  development  projects for future  regional shopping  centers and The Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership  (the Manager). Shopping  centers  that are not  controlled  and that are  owned  through  joint ventures with third parties  (Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.       The  operations  of the shopping  centers are best  understood by measuring their  performance  as a  whole,  without  regard  to  the  Company's  ownership interest.  Consequently,  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the Consolidated Businesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented and discussed as a whole.       On September 30, 1998, the Operating  Partnership exchanged interests in 10 shopping  centers (nine  Consolidated  Businesses and one  Unconsolidated  Joint Venture)  and a  share  of  the  Operating  Partnership's  debt  for  all of the partnership  units owned by two General  Motors  pension trusts (GMPT) (the GMPT Exchange).  See Results of Operations  -GMPT  Exchange and Related  Transactions below.   Performance   statistics  presented  below  exclude  these  10  centers (transferred centers).  Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues       Over the long  term,  the level of mall  tenant  sales is the  single  most important  determinant of revenues of the shopping  centers because mall tenants provide  approximately  90% of these  revenues  and because  mall  tenant  sales determine  the  amount  of  rent,  percentage  rent,  and  recoverable  expenses (together,  total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However, levels of mall tenant sales can be  considerably  more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs.       The Company believes that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn  profits  over long  periods of time  increases  as sales per  square  foot increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot.                                         20         The following table summarizes occupancy costs,  excluding  utilities,  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales.                                                  1999         1998        1997                                                 ----         ----        ----        Mall tenant sales (in thousands)     $2,695,645   $2,332,726   $1,965,905       Sales per square foot                       453          426          410        Minimum rents                               9.7%         9.7%        10.0%       Percentage rents                            0.2          0.3          0.3       Expense recoveries                          4.3          4.1          4.2                                                 -----        -----        -----       Mall tenant occupancy costs                14.2%        14.1%        14.5%                                                 =====        =====        =====  Occupancy       Historically,  average  annual  occupancy has been within a narrow band. In the last ten years, average annual occupancy has ranged between 86.5% and 89.4%. Mall tenant average  occupancy,  ending  occupancy and leased space rates are as follows:                                                  1999         1998        1997                                                 ----         ----        ----     Mall Tenant Average Occupancy                89.0%        89.4%        88.0%    Ending Occupancy                             90.4         90.2         90.7    Leased Space                                 92.1         92.3         92.7  Rental Rates       As leases have expired in the shopping  centers,  the Company has generally been able to rent the available  space,  either to the existing  tenant or a new tenant,  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases.  In a period of  increasing  sales,  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations  of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In periods of slower growth or  declining  sales,  rents on new leases  will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason.  However, Center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are  terminated  early and replaced with new leases negotiated  at current  rental  rates that are  usually  higher than the average rates for existing  leases.  The following  table contains  certain  information regarding per square foot base rent at the shopping centers that have been owned and open for five years.                                                  1999         1998         1997                                                 ----         ----         ----     Average Base Rent per square foot:        All mall tenants                         $43.58       $41.93      $41.37       Stores closing during the year           $41.14       $44.27      $39.07       Stores opening during the year           $52.64       $47.92      $41.08       In 1999,  average base rent per square foot for stores  opening  during the year was  somewhat  weighted by the leasing of smaller  than  average  spaces at several of the Company's most productive  centers.  The Company expects the rent spread  between  opening  and  closing  stores  in 2000  to be in the  Company's historic  range of $5.00 to $10.00 per square foot.  However,  this statistic is difficult  to  predict  in part  because  the  Company's  leasing  policies  and practices may result in early lease  terminations  with actual  average  closing rents per square  foot which may vary from the  average  rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations.                                         21  Seasonality       The  regional  shopping  center  industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and  back-to-school  events.  While  minimum  rents and  recoveries  are generally not subject to seasonal  factors,  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter,  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Accordingly,  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.                                              1st            2nd             3rd             4th                                         Quarter        Quarter         Quarter         Quarter         Total                                          1999           1999            1999            1999            1999                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                   (in  thousands)                Mall Tenant Sales                  $533,730       $598,956       $ 610,520        $952,439      $2,695,645   Revenues                            117,485        127,669         125,140         139,327         509,621   Occupancy:        Average                          88.5%          88.1%           88.9%           90.3%           89.0%        Ending                           87.5%          88.0%           89.5%           90.4%           90.4%   Leased Space                          91.3%          91.7%           92.8%           92.1%           92.1%        Because the  seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries, mall tenant occupancy costs (the sum of minimum rents,   percentage  rents  and  expense  recoveries)   relative  to  sales  are considerably  higher in the first  three  quarters  than they are in the  fourth quarter.                                              1st            2nd             3rd             4th                                       Quarter        Quarter         Quarter         Quarter           Total                                          1999           1999            1999            1999            1999                                --------------- -------------- --------------- --------------- ---------------                Minimum Rents                          11.8%          10.8%           10.7%            7.2%            9.7%   Percentage Rents                        0.2            0.1             0.1             0.5             0.2   Expense Recoveries                      4.6            4.9             4.5             3.4             4.3                                          -----          -----           -----           -----           -----   Mall Tenant Occupancy Costs            16.6%          15.8%           15.3%           11.1%           14.2%                                          -----          -----           -----           -----           -----   Results of Operations       The  following  represent  significant  debt and equity  transactions,  new center openings, expansions, and acquisitions which affect the operating results described under Comparison of 1999 to 1998.  GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions       On September 30, 1998, the Operating  Partnership exchanged interests in 10 shopping  centers  (nine wholly  owned and one  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture), together  with  $990  million  of  debt,  for all of  GMPT's  partnership  units (approximately 50 million units with a fair value of $675 million,  based on the average  stock price of the  Company's  common shares of $13.50 for the two week period  prior  to the  closing),  providing  the  Company  with a  majority  and controlling  interest in the Operating  Partnership.  The Operating  Partnership continues to manage the centers exchanged under management agreements with GMPT. The management  agreements are cancelable with 90 days notice.  Certain costs of providing services under these agreements,  including administrative and certain other fixed costs,  would not necessarily be eliminated if the contracts were to be canceled or not renewed.  The actual  reduction of costs would be affected by whether all or a portion of the contracts  were canceled or not renewed,  timing of the  cancellation  or non-renewal,  and actual or anticipated  changes in the Operating Partnership's owned or managed portfolio.       In anticipation of the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating  Partnership  used the $1.2 billion  proceeds from two bridge loans to extinguish  $1.1 billion of debt in September 1998. The remaining  proceeds were used primarily to pay prepayment premiums and  transaction  costs.  GMPT's share of debt received in the exchange included  the $902  million  balance  on the  first  bridge  loan,  $86  million representing  50% of the debt on the Joint Venture owned  shopping  center,  and $1.6 million of assessment  bond  obligations.  The $340 million  balance on the second bridge loan was refinanced during the first half of 1999.                                         22        Concurrently with the GMPT Exchange the Operating Partnership, expecting to reduce  its  annual  general  and   administrative   expense,   committed  to  a restructuring of its operations and recognized a $10.7 million charge related to this   restructuring.   During  the  fourth   quarter  of  1998,   general   and administrative  expense  decreased  $2.2 million from the  comparable  period in 1997.  During 1999,  general and  administrative  expense decreased $6.5 million from 1998.  Substantially  all of the decrease in 1999  expense  occurred in the first three quarters of 1999.       Because the Company's  portfolio  changed  significantly as a result of the GMPT Exchange,  the results of operations of the  transferred  centers have been separately  classified  within the  Consolidated  Businesses and  Unconsolidated Joint  Ventures for  purposes of  analyzing  and  understanding  the  historical results of the current portfolio.       Since the Company's interest in the Operating Partnership has been its sole material  asset  throughout all periods  presented,  references in the following discussion to "the  Company"  include the  Operating  Partnership,  except where intercompany  transactions are discussed or as otherwise noted,  even though the Operating  Partnership did not become a consolidated  subsidiary until September 30, 1998.  Other Debt and Equity Transactions       In September and November 1999, the Operating Partnership completed private placements  totaling  $100  million  of  9%  Cumulative   Redeemable   Preferred Partnership  Equity  (Series C Preferred  Equity and Series D Preferred  Equity, respectively), which were purchased by institutional investors. The net proceeds were used to pay down lines of credit.       In August  1999,  a  seven-year  secured  financing of $177 million with an all-in rate of 7.8% was completed by the 50% owned  Unconsolidated Joint Venture that owns  Cherry  Creek.  The  proceeds  were used to repay the  existing  $130 million   mortgage  and  transaction   costs.  The  remaining  net  proceeds  of approximately $45.2 million were distributed to the Operating Partnership, which had  contributed  all the funding for the 1998  expansion of Cherry  Creek.  The Operating Partnership used the distribution to pay down lines of credit.       In June 1999,  the  Operating  Partnership's  $200  million  line of credit facility was securitized, with interests in Fairlane, LaCumbre, Paseo Nuevo, and Regency  Square  serving as  collateral.  The rate on the line was  decreased to LIBOR plus 0.90%.       In April 1999, a ten-year  financing of $270 million with an all-in rate of approximately  6.9% secured by The Mall at Short Hills was  completed.  Also, in June  1999,  a  ten-year  financing  of $80  million  with  an  all-in  rate  of approximately  7.8%  secured by Biltmore  Fashion  Park was  completed.  The net proceeds  of these  financings  were  used to pay off the  entire  $340  million balance on the bridge loan.       In April  1999,  a  three-year  $170  million  loan  secured by Great Lakes Crossing was finalized,  with proceeds used to repay the balance of the existing construction facility. The loan bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.50%. In addition,   the  Company   finalized  an  amendment  to  the  MacArthur   Center construction  facility,  with  total  availability  under the  facility  of $120 million at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 1.35%.       In January 1998, the Operating Partnership redeemed a partner's 6.1 million units of partnership interest for approximately $77.7 million (including costs). The  redemption  was funded  through  the use of an  existing  revolving  credit facility.                                         23   Openings, Expansions, Acquisitions, and Other       In March 1999, MacArthur Center, a 70% owned enclosed  super-regional mall, opened in Norfolk,  Virginia. In November 1998, Great Lakes Crossing, an 85% (an increase from 80%-see below) owned enclosed value super-regional mall, opened in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Both Great Lakes Crossing and MacArthur Center are owned by joint ventures in which the Operating Partnership has a controlling interest, and  consequently the results of these centers are consolidated in the Company's financial  statements.  The  Operating  Partnership  is  entitled to a preferred return on its equity contributions to these centers. The contributed capital was used to fund construction  costs. The income effect of the cumulative  preferred return net of the interest on the Operating Partnership's  associated borrowings was approximately $2.0 million for 1999. The net effect in 2000 of any recurring preference  is expected to be minimal.  At Cherry Creek,  a 132,000  square foot expansion opened in stages throughout the fall of 1998.       In November 1999, the Operating  Partnership  acquired Lord  Associates,  a retail leasing firm based in  Alexandria,  Virginia for $2.5 million in cash and $5 million in partnership units, which are subject to certain contingencies.  In addition, $1.0 million of the purchase price is contingent upon profits achieved on acquired leasing  contracts.  Of the cash purchase price,  approximately $1.0 million was paid at closing and $1.5 million will be paid over five years.       In 1996,  the  Operating  Partnership  entered  into an  agreement to lease Memorial  City Mall,  a 1.4  million  square  foot  shopping  center  located in Houston,  Texas.  The lease was subject to certain  provisions  that enabled the Operating  Partnership to explore  significant  redevelopment  opportunities and terminate the lease  obligations in the event such  redevelopment  opportunities were not deemed to be sufficient.  In November  1999, the Operating  Partnership exercised its option to terminate the lease.  Under the terms of the lease,  the Operating Partnership will continue to manage the center until May 2000.       In December  1999,  the  Operating  Partnership  acquired an  additional 5% interest  in Great  Lakes  Crossing  for $1.2  million in cash,  increasing  the Operating Partnership's interest in the center to 85%.  Subsequent Events       In January 2000, the Company agreed to exchange property interests with its current joint venture partner in two  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures.  Under the terms of the  agreement,  expected to be completed in first  quarter  2000,  the Operating  Partnership will assume 100 percent ownership of Twelve Oaks Mall and the current  joint  venture  partner will become 100 percent  owner of Lakeside. Both properties  will remain subject to the existing  mortgages ($50 million and $88  million  at  Twelve  Oaks  and  Lakeside,   respectively.)   The  Operating Partnership  will also pay the joint  venture  partner $30 million in cash.  The Operating  Partnership  will  continue to manage  Twelve  Oaks,  while the joint venture partner will assume  management  responsibility  of Lakeside at closing. Upon completion of the  transaction,  the Company expects to recognize a gain on the exchange,  representing the excess of the fair value over the net book basis of the Company's  interest in Lakeside  Mall,  adjusted for the $30 million paid and  transaction  costs.  Aside from this book gain, the Company does not expect the  transaction  to  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Company's  results  of operations.       In January  2000,  the 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owns Stamford  Town  Center  completed  a $76  million  secured  financing.  The  new financing  bears interest at a rate of one-month  LIBOR plus 0.8% and matures in 2002 with a two-year  extension  option.  The rate is capped at 8.2% plus credit spread for the term of the loan. The proceeds were used to repay the $54 million participating  mortgage,  the $18.3  million  prepayment  premium,  and  accrued interest and transaction costs.                                         24   Presentation of Operating Results       In order to  facilitate  the  analysis of the ongoing  business for periods prior to the GMPT Exchange,  the following tables contain the combined operating results of the Company and the Operating Partnership and also present separately the revenues and expenses,  other than interest,  depreciation and amortization, of the transferred centers.  Income allocated to the noncontrolling partners and preferred  interests  is  deducted  to arrive at the  results  allocable  to the Company's  common   shareowners.   Because  the  net  equity  of  the  Operating Partnership's  unitholders is less than zero, for periods subsequent to the GMPT Exchange, the income allocated to the noncontrolling  partners is equal to their share of  distributions.  The net equity of these minority partners is less than zero due to  accumulated  distributions  in  excess of net  income  and not as a result of operating  losses.  Distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes  non-cash  charges for  depreciation  and amortization.  The  Company's  average  ownership  percentage  of the  Operating Partnership was 63% for 1999 and 43% for 1998 (including averages of 39% for the period through the GMPT Exchange and 63% thereafter.)                                         25   Comparison of 1999 to 1998     The following table sets forth operating  results for 1999 and 1998,  showing the results of the Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:                                                              1999                                                  1998                                    ---------------------------------------------      ----------------------------------------------                                                     UNCONSOLIDATED                                       UNCONSOLIDATED                                     CONSOLIDATED       JOINT                            CONSOLIDATED          JOINT                                     BUSINESSES(1)     VENTURES(2)        TOTAL          BUSINESSES(1)      VENTURES(2)       TOTAL                                    ---------------------------------------------      ----------------------------------------------                                                                           (in millions of dollars)               REVENUES:   Minimum rents                            133.9         158.1           292.1              99.8             149.3           249.1   Percentage rents                           4.6           3.9             8.6               5.2               3.7             8.9   Expense recoveries                        78.9          83.6           162.4              57.9              79.2           137.1   Management, leasing and     development                             23.9                          23.9              12.3                              12.3   Other                                     16.3           6.4            22.7              17.4               6.8            24.2   Revenues -

(4)  EBITDA   represents   earnings   before  interest  and   depreciation   and      amortization.  Funds from  Operations is defined and discussed in Liquidity      and Capital Resources.

Minimum rents increased $34.1 million of which  $30.6  million was caused by the  opening of  MacArthur  Center and Great Lakes Crossing.  Minimum rents also increased due to tenant  rollovers.  Expense recoveries increased primarily due to the new centers. Revenues from management, leasing,  and  development  services  increased  primarily due to the management agreements  with GMPT.  Other revenue  decreased  primarily due to a decrease in gains on sales of peripheral  land,  partially offset by increases in garage and trash removal services and lease cancellation fees.       Total operating costs were $237.0 million, a $5.5 million, or 2.3% decrease from the comparable period in 1998,  excluding expenses other than depreciation, amortization  and  interest of the  transferred  centers.  Recoverable  expenses increased  primarily  due to Great Lakes  Crossing and MacArthur  Center.  Other operating  expense  increased due to an increase in the charge to operations for costs of unsuccessful and potentially unsuccessful  pre-development  activities, the new  centers,  and bad  debt  expense.  Costs  of  management,  leasing  and development  services increased primarily due to the management  agreements with GMPT. General and administrative expense decreased $6.5 million primarily due to decreases in payroll  costs,  travel and  professional  fees.  Interest  expense decreased  primarily  due to the  assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT Exchange  and debt paid  down with the  proceeds  of the  Series C and  Series D Preferred  Equity  offerings,  partially  offset by an  increase in debt used to finance Great Lakes Crossing and MacArthur  Center and a decrease in capitalized interest  related  to these  centers.  Depreciation  and  amortization  expenses decreased due to the transferred centers, partially offset by an increase due to the new centers.       During 1998,  a $10.7  million loss on the  restructuring  was  recognized, which  primarily  represented  the cost of certain  involuntary  terminations of personnel.  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures       Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $252.0 million,  a $12.9 million, or 5.4%,  increase from the comparable period of 1998,  excluding revenues of the transferred center. Minimum rents increased due to the expansion at Cherry Creek and tenant rollovers.  Expense recoveries also increased because of the Cherry Creek expansion and an increase in property taxes recoverable from tenants at certain centers.       Total  operating  costs  decreased by $20.2 million (of which $17.7 million represented the expenses other than interest,  depreciation, and amortization of the transferred  center) to $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Recoverable  expenses increased  primarily due to the Cherry Creek expansion and an  increase in  property  taxes at certain  centers.  Other  operating  expense increased  primarily  due to increases  in bad debt  expense.  Interest  expense decreased  primarily  due to the  assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT Exchange. Depreciation and amortization decreased due to the transferred center, offset by an increase due to the Cherry Creek expansion.       Income before  extraordinary  items of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures decreased by $14.1 million, or 15.7%, to $75.6 million.  The Company's equity in income before extraordinary items of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $39.3 million, a 15.3% decrease from the comparable period in 1998.  Net Income       As a result of the  foregoing,  the Company's  income before  extraordinary items,  minority and preferred  interests  decreased $12.0 million, or 17.0%, to $58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The Company  recognized $0.5 million in  extraordinary  losses related to the  extinguishment  of debt during 1999, while an extraordinary  charge of $50.8 million for the  extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the GMPT Exchange, was recognized in 1998. The income of the Operating Partnership allocable to minority partners increased to a total of $30.0  million,  from $6.0  million in 1998,  primarily  due to the  minority partners'   $30.7   million  share  of  the   extraordinary   charges  in  1998. Distributions of $2.4 million to the Operating Partnership's Series C and Series D Preferred  Equity owners were made in 1999.  After payment of $16.6 million in Series A preferred dividends,  net income (loss) available to common shareowners for 1999 was $8.9 million compared to $(3.0) million in 1998.                                         27  Comparison of 1998 to 1997       Discussion of significant debt and equity transactions,  acquisitions,  and openings  occurring  in 1998 is  included  in the  Comparison  of 1999 to  1998. Significant 1997 items are described below.       In October 1997, the Company used the $200 million public offering of eight million shares of 8.3% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock to acquire a  preferred  equity  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership.  The  Operating Partnership  used the net  proceeds  to pay down debt under  existing  revolving credit and commercial paper facilities,  which were used to fund the acquisition of  Regency  Square  in  September   1997.  In  September  1997,  the  Operating Partnership acquired Regency Square (Regency) shopping center for $123.9 million in cash.  Additionally,  in November  1997,  the  Operating  Partnership  opened Arizona Mills, a 37% owned value  super-regional  shopping  center.  In December 1997,  the Operating  Partnership  acquired The Falls  shopping  center for $156 million in cash and the leasehold interest in The Mall at Tuttle Crossing, which opened in July 1997. These two centers were transferred to GMPT.       A 135,000  square foot  expansion  opened at Westfarms  in August 1997.  In addition, approximately 50,000 square feet of new mall stores opened at Biltmore in 1997.       The Company's average ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership was 43% for 1998 (including averages of 39% for the period through the GMPT Exchange and 63% thereafter) and 37% for 1997.                                         28  Comparison of 1998 to 1997       The following table sets forth operating results for 1998 and 1997, showing the results of the Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:                                                              1998                                                  1997                                    ---------------------------------------------      ----------------------------------------------                                                     UNCONSOLIDATED                                       UNCONSOLIDATED                                     CONSOLIDATED       JOINT                            CONSOLIDATED          JOINT                                     BUSINESSES(1)     VENTURES(2)        TOTAL          BUSINESSES(1)      VENTURES(2)       TOTAL                                    ---------------------------------------------      ----------------------------------------------                                                                           (in millions of dollars)              REVENUES:   Minimum rents                             99.8         149.3           249.1              86.4             121.1           207.5   Percentage rents                           5.2           3.7             8.9               5.0               2.6             7.5   Expense recoveries                        57.9          79.2           137.1              51.6              64.4           115.9   Management, leasing and     development                             12.3                          12.3               8.5                               8.5   Other                                     17.4           6.8            24.2              11.4               8.0            19.4   Revenues -

Minimum rents increased $13.4 million, of which $8.9 million was due to the opening of Great Lakes  Crossing and the  acquisition of Regency. Minimum  rents also  increased  because of the  expansion at Biltmore and tenant rollovers.  Expense recoveries  increased  primarily due to Great Lakes Crossing and  Regency.  Revenues  from  management,   leasing  and  development  services increased  primarily  due to the new  management  agreements  with  GMPT.  Other revenue  increased  primarily due to an increase in gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation revenue.       Total operating costs increased $22.8 million,  or 8.6%, to $286.8 million. Recoverable and other operating  expenses  increased due to Great Lakes Crossing and Regency.  Other operating  expense also increased due to professional  fees, management  expense  and an increase  in the charge to  operations  for costs of unsuccessful and potentially unsuccessful  pre-development  activities.  General and  administrative  expense  decreased  $2.1  million  between  periods  due to decreases  in payroll and  reduced  employee  relocation  and  recruiter  costs, partially  offset by  increases  attributable  to the  phase-in of the long term compensation plan.       Interest  expense  increased  due to an  increase  in debt used to  finance Tuttle Crossing,  the acquisition of The Falls and the redemption of a partner's interest in the Operating  Partnership,  partially  offset by a decrease in debt paid down with the proceeds of the October 1997 and April 1998 equity  offerings and the  assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT  Exchange.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased due to Great Lakes Crossing, Tuttle Crossing, Regency and The Falls,  partially  offset by the  decrease in expense due to the transferred  centers  only being  included in 1998  through the date of the GMPT Exchange.       Revenues  and  expenses  other  than  interest  and  depreciation  for  the transferred  centers for 1998 represent  operations through the date of the GMPT Exchange.  The resulting  decreases from 1997 were partially offset by increases in revenues and expenses due to the  acquisition of The Falls and the opening of Tuttle Crossing.       During 1998,  a $10.7  million loss on the  restructuring  was  recognized, which  primarily  represented  the cost of certain  involuntary  terminations of personnel.  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures       Total revenues for 1998 were $286.3  million,  a $27.5  million,  or 10.6%, increase  from 1997.  The increase in minimum rents and expense  recoveries  was primarily due to Arizona Mills and the expansions at Westfarms and Cherry Creek. Minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers. Other revenue decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to a decrease in gains on peripheral land sales.       Total  operating  costs  increased by $30.3  million,  or 18.2%,  to $196.7 million  for  1998.  Recoverable  and  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses increased  primarily due to Arizona Mills and the  expansions.  Other  operating expense  increased  primarily due to Arizona Mills.  Interest expense  increased primarily  due to an  increase  in debt used to  finance  Arizona  Mills and the Westfarms expansion, and a decrease in capitalized interest related to these two projects.       Revenues  and  expenses  other  than  interest  and  depreciation  for  the transferred  centers for 1998 represent the operations of Woodfield  through the date of the GMPT Exchange, resulting in decreases from the prior year.       As a result  of the  foregoing,  income  before  extraordinary  item of the Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  decreased by $2.7  million,  or 2.9%,  to $89.7 million.  The  Company's  equity  in  income  before  extraordinary  item of the Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  was $46.4  million,  a 4.9%  decrease  from the comparable period in 1997.                                         30      Net Income       As a result of the  foregoing,  the Company's  income before  extraordinary items,  minority and preferred interest decreased to $70.4 million for 1998. The income  allocable to minority  partners  decreased to $6.0  million,  from $57.8 million,   reflecting  the  Company's   increased  ownership  in  the  Operating Partnership due to the GMPT Exchange and other equity  transactions,  as well as the minority partners' $30.7 million share of the 1998 extraordinary items.       Also,  the Company  recognized  its $20.1 million share of $50.8 million in extraordinary  charges  related to the  extinguishment  of debt,  including debt extinguished  in  anticipation  of the GMPT  Exchange,  primarily  consisting of prepayment  premiums.  After  payment  of $16.6  million  in Series A  preferred dividends, net income (loss) available to common shareowners for 1998 was $(3.0) million compared to $24.6 million for 1997.                                         31    Liquidity and Capital Resources       In the following  discussion,  references to beneficial  interest represent the  Operating  Partnership's  share  of the  results  of its  consolidated  and unconsolidated  businesses.  The  Company  does not have,  and has not had,  any parent company  indebtedness;  all debt discussed represents  obligations of the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries and joint ventures.       The Company  believes that its net cash  provided by operating  activities, distributions  from its joint  ventures,  the  unutilized  portion of its credit facilities,  and its ability to access the  capital  markets,  assures  adequate liquidity  to  conduct  its  operations  in  accordance  with its  dividend  and financing policies.       As of December 31,  1999,  the Company had a  consolidated  cash balance of $20.6  million.  Additionally,  the Company has a secured  $200  million line of credit.  The line had $63.0  million of  borrowings  as of December 31, 1999 and expires in September  2001. The Company also has available a second bank line of credit of up to $40  million.  The line had $17.6  million of  borrowings  as of December 31, 1999.  Debt and Equity Transactions       Discussion of  significant  debt and equity  transactions  occurring in the three years ended  December 31, 1999 is contained in Results of  Operations.  In addition to the transactions  described therein, the following transactions have occurred  which will affect the  Company's  liquidity  and capital  resources in future periods.       In  October  1999,  the 50%  owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is developing  Dolphin  Mall  closed  on a $200  million,  three-year  construction facility.  The rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 2%,  decreasing  to LIBOR plus 1.75% when a certain coverage ratio is met. The rate on the loan is capped at 7% plus credit spread until maturity.  Under the interest rate agreement,  the rate is swapped  to a fixed  rate of 5.15%  when LIBOR is less than 6%. The  maturity date may be  extended  one year.  The  balance at  December  31,  1999 was $22.3 million.       In  November  1999,  the 26% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is developing   International   Plaza  closed  on  a  $193.5  million,   three-year construction  financing,  with a  one-year  extension  option.  The  rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 1.90%. There were no borrowings as of December 31, 1999.       In January 2000, the Company  finalized an agreement that  securitized  the $40 million bank line of credit and extended its maturity to August 2000.       In March 2000, the Company's Board of Directors  authorized the purchase of up to $50 million of the  Company's  common stock in the open market.  The stock may be purchased from time to time as market conditions warrant.  Summary of Investing Activities       Net cash used in investing  activities  was $197.4 million in 1999 compared to $269.9 million in 1998. Cash used in investing activities was impacted by the timing  of  capital  expenditures,  with  outflows  in  1999  and  1998  for the construction of MacArthur Center, Great Lakes Crossing, International Plaza, The Mall at Wellington Green, The Shops at Willow Bend, as well as other development activities and other capital items (see Capital  Spending  below).  During 1999, $18.5  million was used in  purchasing  investments  in  Fashionmall.com,  Inc., Swerdlow  Real  Estate  Group,  and  Lord  Associates.  Proceeds  from  sales of peripheral   land   decreased  in  1999  by  $4.9  million,   to  $1.8  million. Contributions  to  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures are impacted  primarily by the timing of construction and expansion activities, which in 1999 and 1998 included projects at Dolphin  Mall,  International  Plaza,  Cherry  Creek,  Woodland  and Lakeside.  Distributions  from  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures in 1999 and 1998 included  distributions  from centers  comprised of excess mortgage  refinancing proceeds  ($45.2  million from Cherry Creek in 1999 and $45.9  million from Fair Oaks in 1998),  while the loss of  distributions  from Woodfield  after the GMPT Exchange was offset by increases at other centers.                                         32        Net cash used in investing  activities in 1998 was $269.9 million  compared to  $178.3  million  in  1997.  As  the  Company's  interest  in  the  Operating Partnership changed  significantly as a result of the GMPT Exchange (see Results of Operations - GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions), investing activities of periods  prior to this  transaction  are not  comparable.  In 1997,  the Company acquired  its  $200  million   preferred   equity   interest  in  the  Operating Partnership,  and  received  $21.7  million  of  distributions  from its  equity investment in the Operating  Partnership in excess of its share of the Operating Partnership's income.  Summary of Financing Activities       Financing activities contributed cash of $91.3 million, a decrease of $40.0 million from the $131.3 million in 1998.  Borrowings net of debt  repayments and issuance costs decreased by $244.5 million to $100.9 million, while net proceeds from equity  offerings  increased by $71.3  million to $100.4  million.  The net decrease  in the debt and  equity  sources  of  $173.2  million  was  offset  by decreases in cash used in 1999 compared to 1998 in connection with (i) the $77.7 million  partner  redemption in January 1998, (ii) the greater amount of partner distributions  made in 1998 due the Company's  larger  pre-GMPT  Exchange equity base, and (iii) transaction costs incurred in connection with the GMPT Exchange.       Net cash  provided  by  financing  activities  in 1998 was  $131.3  million compared to $149.3 million in 1997.  Financing  activities for 1998 and 1997 are not  comparable  due to the GMPT  Exchange.  In 1997,  the  Company  issued $200 million of 8.3%  preferred  stock,  for which 1998  reflects a complete  year of dividends.  Beneficial Interest in Debt     At December 31, 1999,  the Operating  Partnership's  debt and its  beneficial interest  in the debt of its  Consolidated  and  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures totaled $1,300.2 million. As shown in the following table, there was no unhedged floating  rate debt at December  31, 1999.  Interest  rates shown do not include amortization of debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs. These items are reported as interest expense in the results of operations. In the aggregate, these costs added 0.42% to the effective rate of interest on beneficial interest in debt at December 31, 1999.  Included in  beneficial  interest in debt is debt used to fund development and expansion costs.  Beneficial  interest in assets on which  interest is being  capitalized  totaled $257.1 million as of December 31, 1999. Beneficial interest in capitalized interest was $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.

Based on the  Operating  Partnership's  beneficial interest  in debt and  interest  rates in effect at  December  31,  1999,  a one percent  increase in interest  rates on floating  rate debt would  decrease cash flows by  approximately  $2.9  million  and,  due to the  effect of  capitalized interest,  annual earnings by approximately $2.2 million. A one percent decrease in interest  rates on floating  rate debt would  increase  cash flows and annual earnings by approximately $4.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively.  Based on the  Company's  consolidated  debt and interest  rates in effect at December 31, 1999, a one percent  increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by  approximately  $13  million,  while a one percent  decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $32 million.                                         34   Covenants and Commitments       Certain loan agreements  contain various  restrictive  covenants  including limitations  on net worth,  minimum  debt  service  and fixed  charges  coverage ratios, a maximum payout ratio on distributions, and a minimum debt yield ratio, the  latter  being  the  most  restrictive.  The  Operating  Partnership  is  in compliance with all of such covenants.       Payment of principal  and interest on the Great Lakes  Crossing,  MacArthur Center,   and   International   Plaza  loans  is  guaranteed  by  the  Operating Partnership.  The total amount  outstanding on these loans was $285.2 million at December  31,  1999.  The new investor in the  International  Plaza  venture has indemnified the Operating  Partnership to the extent of approximately 25% of the amounts guaranteed on the International Plaza loan. In addition,  the payment of principal  and interest on the Arizona  Mills' debt is guaranteed by each of the owners  of  Arizona  Mills  to  the  extent  of  its  ownership.  The  Operating Partnership's  guaranty of principal on the Arizona Mills loan was $13.1 million at December 31, 1999. The Operating  Partnership has also guaranteed the payment of 50% of principal  and  interest on the Dolphin Mall loan.  The balance on the Dolphin  Mall loan was $22.3  million  at  December  31,  1999.  All of the loan agreements  provide for a reduction of the amount  guaranteed as certain  center performance and valuation criteria are met.  Funds from Operations       A principal factor that the Company  considers in determining  dividends to shareowners is Funds from  Operations  (FFO),  which is defined as income before extraordinary and unusual items, real estate depreciation and amortization,  and the  allocation  to the minority  interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  less preferred dividends and distributions.       Funds from  Operations  does not represent cash flows from  operations,  as defined  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,   and  should  not  be considered  to be an  alternative  to net income as an  indicator  of  operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. However, the National  Association of Real Estate  Investment  Trusts suggests that Funds from Operations is a useful  supplemental  measure of operating  performance for REITs.       In October 1999,  NAREIT approved certain  clarifications of the definition of  FFO,   including   that   non-recurring   items  that  are  not  defined  as "extraordinary"   under  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  should  be reflected in the  calculation  of FFO.  The  clarified  definition  is effective January 1, 2000 and restatement of all periods  presented is recommended.  Under the clarified  definition,  the Company would have included in FFO, for the year ended  December 31, 1998,  the $10.7 million  restructuring  charge  (Results of Operations  -  GMPT  Exchange  and  Related   Transactions),   resulting  in  an approximate  $0.09  decrease to the  Company's  FFO per share  reported for that period. There would have been no change to the amounts reported for 1999.                                         35   Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds from Operations                                                Year Ended          Year Ended                                             December 31, 1999  December 31, 1998                                             -----------------  -----------------                                                  (in millions of dollars) Income before extraordinary items,   minority and preferred interests (1)              58.4               70.4 Restructuring loss                                                     10.7 Depreciation and amortization (2)                   52.5               57.4 Share of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures    depreciation and amortization (3)                20.4               20.7 Other income/expenses, net                                              0.5 Non-real estate depreciation                        (2.7)              (2.3) Preferred dividends and distributions              (19.0)             (16.6) Minority interest in consolidated joint ventures    (0.7)                                                    -----              ----- Funds from Operations                              108.9              140.8                                                    =====              ===== Funds from Operations allocable to the Company      68.5               61.1                                                    =====              =====  (1)  Includes  gains on  peripheral  land sales of $1.7 million and $6.0 million      for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

(3)  Includes   $1.2  million  and  $1.3   million  of  mall  tenant   allowance      amortization for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. (4)  Amounts in the tables may not add due to rounding.  Dividends       The Company  pays  regular  quarterly  dividends to its common and Series A preferred shareowners. Dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash  available to the Company,  its financial condition,  capital and other requirements,  and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.  Preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings, cash availability, or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends.       On December 9, 1999,  the Company  declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.245 per common share payable  January 20, 2000 to  shareowners of record on December 31, 1999. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.51875 per share on the Company's 8.3% Series A Preferred Stock, paid December 31, 1999 to shareowners of record on December 21, 1999.       Common dividends declared totaled $0.965 per common share in 1999, of which $0.4534 represented return of capital and $0.5116  represented  ordinary income, compared  to  dividends  declared in 1998 of $0.945 per common  share,  of which $0.854 represented return of capital and $0.091 represented ordinary income. The tax status of total 2000 common dividends declared and to be declared,  assuming continuation of a $0.245 per common share quarterly dividend, is estimated to be approximately  40% return of capital,  and  approximately  60% ordinary  income. Series A preferred  dividends  declared were $2.075 per preferred  share in 1999 and 1998, all of which represented ordinary income. The tax status of total 2000 dividends  to be paid on  Series  A  Preferred  Stock  is  estimated  to be 100% ordinary income.  These are  forward-looking  statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially,  including:  1) the amount of dividends  declared;  2) changes in the Company's share of anticipated taxable  income of the Operating  Partnership  due to the actual  results of the Operating  Partnership;  3) changes in the number of the  Company's  outstanding shares;  4) property  acquisitions or dispositions;  5) financing  transactions, including  refinancing of existing debt; and 6) changes in the Internal  Revenue Code or its application.       The annual  determination  of the  Company's  common  dividends is based on anticipated Funds from Operations available after preferred  dividends,  as well as financing considerations and other appropriate factors.  Further, the Company has decided that the growth in common  dividends will be less than the growth in Funds from Operations for the immediate future.                                         36        Any inability of the Operating  Partnership or its Joint Ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts,  capital  expenditures and changes in working capital, including development activities and expansions, may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such  obligations,  thereby possibly reducing distributions  to partners of the Operating  Partnership  and funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends.  Capital Spending       Capital  spending  for  routine  maintenance  of the  shopping  centers  is generally recovered from tenants. Capital spending not recovered from tenants is summarized in the following tables:                                                    1999                               --------------------------------------------------                                                            Beneficial Interest                                                             in Consolidated                                             Unconsolidated  Businesses and                               Consolidated     Joint        Unconsolidated                                Businesses     Ventures(1)   Joint Ventures(1)(2)                               --------------------------------------------------                                          (in millions of dollars)  Development, renovation,   and expansion:    Existing centers               12.4           24.9               24.8    New centers                   124.4 (3)      112.9 (4)          160.5 Pre-construction development   activities, net of charge   to operations                    2.0                               2.0 Mall tenant allowances             3.8            6.2                7.0 Corporate office improvements   and equipment                    3.0                               3.0 Other                              0.8            2.4                2.2                                    ---            ---                --- Total                            146.4          146.4              199.5                                  =====          =====              =====  (1)  Costs are net of intercompany profits.

The Operating Partnership's share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased during the year,  excluding  expansion  space and new  developments,  was $12.76 in 1999,  and $11.80 in 1998. In addition,  the  Operating  Partnership's share of capitalized leasing costs in 1999, excluding new developments, was $6.2 million,  or $10.82 per square foot leased and $7.0  million or $7.95 per square foot leased during the year in 1998.  The 1998 amounts  exclude costs related to the transferred centers.                                         37        The Shops at Willow  Bend,  a new 1.4  million  square  foot  center  under construction  in Plano,  Texas,  will be anchored by Neiman  Marcus,  Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor, Foley's and Dillard's. The center is scheduled to open in August 2001; Saks Fifth Avenue will open in 2004. The Mall at Wellington  Green, a 1.3 million square foot center under  construction  in west Palm Beach County, Florida, will be anchored by Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Burdine's,  Dillard's and JCPenney.  The center,  scheduled  to open in October  2001,  will be owned by a joint venture in which the Operating Partnership has a 90% controlling interest. In September 1999, the Company  finalized a partnership  agreement with Swerdlow Real Estate Group to jointly  develop  Dolphin  Mall, a 1.4 million  square foot value regional center located in Miami, Florida. The center is scheduled to open in March 2001.       Additionally,  the Company is  developing  International  Plaza,  a new 1.3 million square foot center under construction in Tampa, Florida. The center will be anchored by Nordstrom,  Lord & Taylor,  Dillard's and Neiman  Marcus,  and is scheduled to open in September  2001.  The Company  originally had a controlling 50.1% interest in the partnership  (Tampa Westshore) that owns the project.  The Company was responsible for providing the funding for project costs in excess of construction  financing in exchange for a preferential return. In November 1999, the Company entered into agreements with a new investor,  which provided funding for the  project  and  thereby  reduced  the  Company's  ownership  interest  to approximately  26%.  It  is  anticipated  that  given  the  preferential  return arrangements,  the original  49.9% owner in Tampa  Westshore  will not initially receive  cash  distributions.  The  Company  expects to be  initially  allocated approximately 33% of the net operating income of the project, with an additional 7% representing return of capital.       The total cost of these four projects is anticipated to be approximately $1 billion.   The  Company's   beneficial   investment  in  the  projects  will  be approximately $700 million, as three of these projects are joint ventures. While the Company intends to finance  approximately 75 percent of each new center with construction  debt,  the  Company has a greater  responsibility  for the project equity  (approximately $230 million).  Approximately $215 million of this amount has been funded through the Operating  Partnership's preferred equity offerings, contributions  from the new joint  venture  partner in the  International  Plaza project,  and borrowing under the Company's lines of credit. With respect to the construction  loan  financing,  the Company has closed on financing  for Dolphin Mall and International  Plaza. The financings on the two remaining  projects are expected to be completed in 2000.       Additionally, a 21-screen theater will be added at Fairlane, in the Detroit metropolitan area and is anticipated to open in the spring of 2000. At Fair Oaks in the Washington, D.C. area, Hecht's expansion will open in the spring of 2000, and a JCPenney  expansion and a newly constructed  Macy's store will open in the fall of 2000. The Operating Partnership's share of the cost of these projects is expected to be approximately $9.8 million.       The Operating Partnership and The Mills Corporation have formed an alliance to develop value  super-regional  projects in major  metropolitan  markets.  The ten-year  agreement  calls for the two  companies to jointly  develop and own at least seven of these centers,  each representing  approximately  $200 million of capital  investment.  A number of  locations  across the nation are targeted for future initiatives.                                         38        The following  table  summarizes  planned  capital  spending,  which is not recovered from tenants and assumes no acquisitions during 2000:                                                      2000                               --------------------------------------------------                                                            Beneficial Interest                                                             in Consolidated                                             Unconsolidated  Businesses and                               Consolidated     Joint        Unconsolidated                                Businesses     Ventures(1)   Joint Ventures(1)(2)                               --------------------------------------------------                                          (in millions of dollars)  Development, renovation,   and expansion                  186.7 (3)      239.5 (4)          279.7 Mall tenant allowances             7.9            4.8               10.1 Pre-construction development   and other                       11.9            0.9               12.3                                  -----          -----              ----- Total                            206.5          245.2              302.1                                  =====          =====              =====  (1)  Costs are net of intercompany profits. (2)  Includes the Operating  Partnership's  share of construction  costs for The      Mall  at  Wellington  Green  (a  90%  owned  consolidated  joint  venture),      International Plaza (a 26% owned unconsolidated joint venture), and Dolphin      Mall (a 50% owned unconsolidated joint venture). (3)  Includes  costs  related  to The  Shops  at  Willow  Bend  and The  Mall at      Wellington Green. (4)  Includes costs related to Dolphin Mall and International Plaza.       The Operating  Partnership  anticipates that its share of costs in 2001 for development  projects  scheduled to be completed in 2001 will be as much as $220 million.  Estimates of future capital spending include only projects approved by the Company's Board of Directors and, consequently, estimates will change as new projects are approved.  Estimates regarding capital expenditures presented above are  forward-looking  statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual  results to differ  materially,  including  but not limited to: 1) actual results of negotiations with anchors, tenants and contractors; 2) changes in the scope and number of projects;  3) cost overruns;  4) timing of expenditures;  5) financing considerations; and 6) actual time to complete projects.  Year 2000 Matters       All  of  the  Company's  financial,  information  and  operational  systems performed and continue to perform satisfactorily with the onset of calendar year 2000.  The Company had  developed a detailed  plan to address the risks posed by the year 2000 issue, as such issue was likely to impact both its own systems and those of third parties with which the Company  conducts  business.  The costs of addressing year 2000 issues were not material to 1998 or 1999 operations.  Cash Tender Agreement       A. Alfred  Taubman has the annual  right to tender to the Company  units of partnership interest in the Operating  Partnership  (provided that the aggregate value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender Agreement).  At A. Alfred Taubman's  election,  his family, and Robert C. Larson and his family may  participate in tenders.  The Company will have the option to pay for  these  interests  from  available  cash,  borrowed  funds,  or from the proceeds of an offering of the Company's  common stock.  Generally,  the Company expects to finance these purchases  through the sale of new shares of its stock. The  tendering  partner will bear all market risk if the market price at closing is less than the purchase price and will bear the costs of sale. Any proceeds of the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of the Company.       Based on a market  value at December  31, 1999 of $10.75 per common  share, the  aggregate  value of  interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  that may be tendered under the Cash Tender  Agreement was  approximately  $259 million.  The purchase  of these  interests  at December  31, 1999 would have  resulted in the Company owning an additional 28% interest in the Operating Partnership.                                         39   New Accounting Pronouncements       In December  1999,  the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial  Statements" (SAB 101). SAB 101 requires that a lessor defer  recognition  of percentage  rents in quarterly periods until the specified target (typically gross sales in excess of a certain  amount) that  triggers  this type of rental  income is achieved.  The Company had  previously  accrued  interim  contingent  rental income as lessees' specified  sales  targets  were met or  achievement  of the  sales  targets  was probable.  The Company adopted the accounting method set forth in SAB 101 during the fourth  quarter of 1999.  Although  the adoption had no impact on annual net income,  the Company  restated the results of the first three  quarters of 1999. The effect of the  restatement  was to reduce net income by $0.3 million  ($0.01 per diluted  common share),  $1.2 million ($0.02 per diluted common share),  and $1.2 million ($0.02 per diluted common share) for the first,  second,  and third quarters of 1999,  respectively,  and to increase  fourth quarter income and per share amounts by $2.7 million and $0.05 per share, respectively.       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  133 requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the balance  sheet as assets and liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of the  derivatives and whether it qualifies for hedge  accounting.  The Company is still  evaluating  the  impact  of  SFAS  133  on  its  consolidated   financial statements.  SFAS 133 is  effective  for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2000.  Item 7A.
