Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains various  "forward-looking  statements" within the  meaning of Section  27A of the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as  amended,  and Section  21E  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  These forward-looking  statements  represent  the  Company's  expectations  or beliefs concerning future events,  including the following:  statements regarding future developments  and joint ventures,  rents and returns,  statements  regarding the continuation of historical  trends and any statements  regarding the sufficiency of the Company's  cash balances and cash  generated from operating and financing activities for the Company's  future  liquidity and capital  resource needs. The Company cautions that although forward-looking  statements reflect the Company's good faith  beliefs and best  judgment  based upon  current  information,  these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements,  including those risks,  uncertainties,  and factors  detailed from time to time in reports filed with the SEC,  and in  particular  those set forth under the  headings  "General Risks of the Company" and "Environmental Matters" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following  discussion  should be read in conjunction  with the accompanying  Consolidated Financial Statements of Taubman Centers, Inc. and the Notes thereto.  General Background and Performance Measurement       The  Company  owns a managing  general  partner's  interest  in The Taubman Realty Group Limited  Partnership  (the Operating  Partnership or TRG),  through which the Company  conducts all of its  operations.  The  Operating  Partnership owns, develops, acquires, and operates regional shopping centers nationally. The Consolidated  Businesses  consist of shopping  centers  that are  controlled  by ownership or contractual  agreement,  development  projects for future  regional shopping  centers and The Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership  (the Manager). Shopping  centers  that are not  controlled  and that are  owned  through  joint ventures with third parties  (Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.       The  operations  of the shopping  centers are best  understood by measuring their  performance  as a  whole,  without  regard  to  the  Company's  ownership interest.  Consequently,  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the Consolidated Businesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented and discussed as a whole.       In  August  2000,  the  Company  completed  a  transaction  to  acquire  an additional interest in one of its Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures;  the Operating Partnership  became the 100% owner of Twelve Oaks and the joint venture  partner became the 100% owner of  Lakeside.  Performance  statistics  presented  include Lakeside through the date of the transaction.       On September 30, 1998, the Operating  Partnership exchanged interests in 10 shopping  centers (nine  Consolidated  Businesses and one  Unconsolidated  Joint Venture)  and a  share  of  the  Operating  Partnership's  debt  for  all of the partnership  units owned by two General  Motors  pension trusts (GMPT) (the GMPT Exchange).   Performance   statistics   presented   exclude   these  10  centers (transferred centers).                                          18   Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues       Over the long  term,  the level of mall  tenant  sales is the  single  most important  determinant of revenues of the shopping  centers because mall tenants provide  approximately  90% of these  revenues  and because  mall  tenant  sales determine  the  amount  of  rent,  percentage  rent,  and  recoverable  expenses (together,  total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However, levels of mall tenant sales can be  considerably  more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs.       The Company believes that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn  profits  over long  periods of time  increases  as sales per  square  foot increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot.       The following table summarizes occupancy costs,  excluding  utilities,  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales.                                           2000             1999             1998                                          ----             ----             ----   Mall tenant sales (in thousands)  $2,717,195       $2,695,645       $2,332,726  Sales per square foot                    479              453              426   Minimum rents                            9.7%             9.7%             9.7%  Percentage rents                         0.3              0.2              0.3  Expense recoveries                       4.4              4.3              4.1                                           ---              ---              ---  Mall tenant occupancy costs             14.4%            14.2%            14.1%                                          ====             ====             ====  Occupancy       Historically,  average  annual  occupancy has been within a narrow band. In the last ten years, average annual occupancy has ranged between 86.5% and 89.4%. Mall tenant average  occupancy,  ending  occupancy and leased space rates are as follows:                                           2000             1999             1998                                          ----             ----             ----   Mall tenant average occupancy           89.1%             89.0%           89.4%  Ending occupancy                        90.5              90.4            90.2  Leased space                            93.8              92.1            92.3  Rental Rates       As leases have expired in the shopping  centers,  the Company has generally been able to rent the available  space,  either to the existing  tenant or a new tenant,  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases.  In a period of  increasing  sales,  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations  of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In periods of slower growth or  declining  sales,  rents on new leases  will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason.  However, center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are  terminated  early and replaced with new leases negotiated  at current  rental  rates that are  usually  higher than the average rates for existing  leases.  The following  table contains  certain  information regarding  per square foot minimum  rent at the shopping  centers that have been owned and open for at least two years.                                                     2000               1999                                                    ----               ----   Average minimum rent per square foot    All mall tenants                               $40.25             $39.58    Stores closing during year                      39.99              39.49    Stores opening during year                      47.04              48.01                                          19         In 1999, average minimum rent per square foot for stores opening during the year was higher because of the leasing of smaller than average spaces at several of the Company's most  productive  centers.  Generally,  the rent spread between opening and closing stores is in the Company's historic range of $5.00 to $10.00 per square  foot.  This  statistic  is  difficult to predict in part because the Company's leasing policies and practices may result in early lease  terminations with  actual  average  closing  rents per  square  foot  which may vary from the average rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations.  Seasonality       The  regional  shopping  center  industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and  back-to-school  events.  While  minimum  rents and  recoveries  are generally not subject to seasonal  factors,  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter,  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the Christmas  selling  season.  Additionally,  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter.  Accordingly,  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.                             1st         2nd        3rd        4th                          Quarter     Quarter    Quarter    Quarter      Total                           2000        2000       2000       2000        2000                       -----------  ---------  ----------  ---------  ----------                                             (in  thousands)  Mall tenant sales      $589,996    $628,999   $602,417    $895,783  $2,717,195  Revenues                132,331     130,923    127,034     142,318     532,606  Occupancy:    Average                  88.8%       88.1%      88.8%       90.3%       89.1%    Ending                   88.5%       88.1%      89.2%       90.5%       90.5%  Leased space               91.4%       90.5%      91.7%       93.8%       93.8%       Because the  seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries, mall tenant occupancy costs (the sum of minimum rents,   percentage  rents  and  expense  recoveries)   relative  to  sales  are considerably  higher in the first  three  quarters  than they are in the  fourth quarter.                            1st         2nd        3rd        4th                          Quarter     Quarter    Quarter    Quarter      Total                           2000        2000       2000       2000        2000                       -----------  ---------  ----------  ---------  ----------   Minimum rents            11.3%      10.6%      10.6%        7.2%       9.7%  Percentage rents          0.3        0.1        0.1         0.6        0.3  Expense recoveries        4.8        4.7        4.7         3.7        4.4                          -----      -----      -----       -----      -----  Mall tenant   occupancy costs         16.4%      15.4%      15.4%       11.5%      14.4%                           ====       ====       ====        ====       ====  Results of Operations       The following  represent  significant debt,  equity, and other transactions which affected the operating results described under Comparison of 2000 to 1999. Refer to Liquidity and Capital  Resources for discussion of new center  openings and other  transactions  which will affect operating  results of future periods. Also,  the  impact of new  accounting  guidance  on  results  of  operations  is discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources - New Accounting Pronouncement.                                          20   Significant Debt, Equity and Other Transactions       In October  2000,  the 37% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owns Arizona Mills completed a $146 million secured  financing.  The financing has an all-in rate of approximately 8.0% and matures in October 2010. The proceeds were primarily  used to  repay  the  existing  $142.2  million  mortgage  and to fund transaction costs. The Operating  Partnership  recognized its $0.2 million share of an extraordinary  charge,  consisting of the write-off of deferred  financing costs.       Also in October 2000,  MacArthur  Center  completed a $145 million  secured financing. The financing has an all-in rate of approximately 7.8% and matures in October  2010.  The  proceeds  were  used to repay  the  existing  $120  million construction  loan  and  transaction   costs.  The  remaining  net  proceeds  of approximately $23.9 million were distributed to the Operating Partnership, which contributed all of the equity funding for the  development of MacArthur  Center. The Operating Partnership used the distribution to pay down its line of credit.       In  August  2000,  the  Company  completed  a  transaction  to  acquire  an additional  ownership in one of its  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  Under the terms of the  agreement,  the  Operating  Partnership  became  the 100% owner of Twelve Oaks and the joint  venture  partner  became the 100% owner of  Lakeside. Both properties  remained subject to the existing mortgage debt ($50 million and $88 million at Twelve Oaks and Lakeside, respectively.) The transaction resulted in a net payment to the joint venture partner of approximately  $25.5 million in cash. The payment was funded by a new $100 million facility, which is secured by an interest in Twelve Oaks and  guaranteed  by the  Operating  Partnership.  The acquisition  of the  additional  interest in Twelve Oaks was  accounted for as a purchase.  The excess of the fair value over the net book basis of the  acquired interest has been allocated to properties.  The results of Twelve Oaks have been consolidated in the Company's results  subsequent to the acquisition date (prior to that  date,  Twelve  Oaks was  accounted  for under the  equity  method as an Unconsolidated  Joint Venture).  The Operating  Partnership  continues to manage Twelve  Oaks,  while  the  former  joint  venture  partner  assumed   management responsibility  for  Lakeside.  A gain of $85.3 million on the  transaction  was recognized by the Company representing its share of the excess of the fair value over the net book basis of the Company's interest in Lakeside,  adjusted for the $25.5 million paid and transaction costs.       The Company has acquired an approximately  6.7% interest in  MerchantWired, LLC, a service company providing internet and network infrastructure to shopping centers and retailers.  The Company's  investment in  MerchantWired is accounted for under the equity method.  Based on projections  received from MerchantWired, LLC, the  Company's  share of projected  losses would reduce income per share by approximately  one cent per share in 2001.  The Company  funded its  investment, which was  approximately  $3 million at  December  31,  2000 and is  expected to increase to approximately $5 million in 2001, through existing lines of credit.       In January  2000,  the 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owns Stamford  Town  Center  completed  a $76  million  secured  financing.  The  new financing  bears interest at a rate of one-month  LIBOR plus 0.8% and matures in 2002.  The loan may be extended  until August  2004.  The rate is capped at 8.2% plus credit spread for the term of the loan. The proceeds were used to repay the $54 million  participating  mortgage,  the $18.3 million prepayment premium, and accrued  interest  and  transaction  costs.  The  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture recognized an extraordinary  charge of $18.6 million,  which consisted primarily of  the  prepayment   premium.   The  Operating   Partnership's   share  of  the extraordinary charge was $9.3 million.       In December  1999,  the  Operating  Partnership  acquired an  additional 5% interest  in Great  Lakes  Crossing  for $1.2  million in cash,  increasing  the Operating Partnership's interest in the center to 85%.       In November 1999, the Operating  Partnership  acquired Lord  Associates,  a retail  leasing  firm,  for $2.5  million in cash and $5 million in  partnership units, which are subject to certain contingencies.  In addition, $1.0 million of this purchase  price is  contingent  upon profits  achieved on acquired  leasing contracts.                                          21         In September and November 1999, the Operating Partnership completed private placements of its Series C and Series D preferred  equity totaling $100 million, with net proceeds  used to pay down lines of credit.  In August  1999,  the $177 million  refinancing of Cherry Creek was  completed,  with net proceeds of $45.2 million  being  distributed  to the Operating  Partnership  and used to pay down lines of credit.  In April 1999 through June 1999,  $520 million of refinancings relating to The Mall at Short  Hills,  Biltmore  Fashion  Park,  and Great Lakes Crossing were completed.       In March 1999, MacArthur Center, a 70% owned enclosed  super-regional mall, opened in Norfolk,  Virginia.  MacArthur  Center is owned by a joint  venture in which the Operating Partnership has a controlling interest, and consequently the results of this center are consolidated in the Company's financial statements.       In 1996,  the  Operating  Partnership  entered  into an  agreement to lease Memorial  City Mall,  a 1.4  million  square  foot  shopping  center  located in Houston,  Texas.  The lease was subject to certain  provisions  that enabled the Operating  Partnership to explore  significant  redevelopment  opportunities and terminate the lease  obligations in the event such  redevelopment  opportunities were not deemed to be  sufficient.  The  Operating  Partnership  terminated  its Memorial City lease on April 30, 2000.  Comparable Center Operations       The  performance  of  the  Company's  portfolio  can  be  measured  through comparisons of comparable centers' operations.  During 2000, revenues (excluding land sales) less operating costs  (operating and recoverable  expenses) of those centers owned and open for the entire period increased approximately two percent in comparison to the same centers' results in the comparable period of 1999. The Company expects that comparable  center operations will increase annually by two to three percent.  This is a forward-looking  statement and certain  significant factors  could  cause the  actual  results  to differ  materially;  refer to the General Risks of the Company in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Presentation of Operating Results       The  following  tables  contain  the  combined  operating  results  of  the Company's Consolidated Businesses and the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.  Income allocated to the noncontrolling  partners and preferred interests is deducted to arrive at the results allocable to the Company's common shareowners. Because the net equity of the Operating  Partnership is less than zero, the income allocated to the noncontrolling partners is equal to their share of distributions. The net equity  of  these  minority  partners  is  less  than  zero  due to  accumulated distributions  in excess of net income and not as a result of operating  losses. Distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes   non-cash  charges  for  depreciation   and   amortization,   although distributions  were  less  than net  income  during  2000 due to the gain on the disposition  of  Lakeside  described  above.  The  Company's  average  ownership percentage  of the  Operating  Partnership  was 63% for both 2000 and 1999.  The results of Twelve Oaks are included in the Consolidated Businesses subsequent to the closing of the transaction, while both Twelve Oaks and Lakeside are included as Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for previous periods.                                          22   Comparison of 2000 to 1999       The following table sets forth operating results for 2000 and 1999, showing the results of the

The Operating  Partnership  terminated its Memorial City lease on April 30,      2000. (2)  With the exception of the Supplemental Information,  amounts represent 100%      of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  Amounts  are net of  intercompany      profits. (3)  Amortization of the Company's additional basis in the Operating Partnership      included in equity in income before  extraordinary  items of Unconsolidated      Joint  Ventures  was $3.8  million  and  $4.7  million  in 2000  and  1999,      respectively.  Also,  amortization  of the  additional  basis  included  in      depreciation and amortization was $4.2 million and $3.8 million in 2000 and      1999, respectively. (4)  EBITDA   represents   earnings   before  interest  and   depreciation   and      amortization.   EBITDA   excludes  gains  on  dispositions  of  depreciated      operating  properties.  Funds from  Operations  is defined and discussed in      Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Minimum rents increased $18.0 million of which $4.3 million was due to the opening of MacArthur Center.  Minimum rents also increased due to the inclusion of Twelve Oaks,  tenant  rollovers,  and new sources of rental income,  including  temporary  tenants and  advertising  space arrangements.  Percentage  rents  increased due to increases in tenant sales and the  inclusion of Twelve Oaks.  Expense  recoveries  increased  primarily due to MacArthur Center and Twelve Oaks. Management,  leasing, and development revenues increased  primarily  due to contracts  acquired as part of the Lord  Associates transaction, partially offset by decreases due to a reduction in fees in certain managed centers, and the timing and completion status of certain other contracts and services.  Other revenue increased  primarily due to an increase in gains on sales of peripheral land and interest income,  partially offset by a decrease in lease cancellation revenue.       Total  operating  costs were  $262.3  million,  a  $25.3  million  or 10.7% increase  from 1999.  Recoverable  expenses and  depreciation  and  amortization increased  primarily due to MacArthur  Center and Twelve Oaks.  Other  operating expense  increased due to MacArthur  Center,  Twelve Oaks,  the Lord  Associates transaction,  and an increase in bad debt  expense,  offset by a decrease in the charge  to  operations  for  costs of  pre-development  activities.  Management, leasing,  and development  costs increased  primarily due to the Lord Associates contracts.  Interest expense increased  primarily due to an increase in interest rates and  borrowings,  including  debt assumed and  incurred  related to Twelve Oaks.  In  addition,  interest  expense  increased  because  of  a  decrease  in capitalized  interest upon opening MacArthur Center. These increases were offset by a  reduction  in  interest  expense  on debt paid down with  proceeds  of the preferred equity offerings.  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures       Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $230.7 million,  a $21.3 million or 8.5% decrease from the comparable period of 1999. Minimum rents and expense recoveries  decreased primarily because the Twelve Oaks and Lakeside results were only included through the transaction date. Other revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in lease cancellation  revenue,  partially offset by an increase in gains on sales of peripheral land.       Total  operating  costs decreased by $4.5 million to $172.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.  Recoverable  expenses decreased  primarily due to Twelve  Oaks and  Lakeside.  Interest  expense  increased  primarily  due to the additional  debt at  Cherry  Creek  as  well as  increases  in  interest  rates, partially offset by Twelve Oaks and Lakeside.       As a result of the  foregoing,  income  before  extraordinary  items of the Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures  decreased by $17.0 million,  or 22.5%,  to $58.6 million.  The  Company's  equity in  income  before  extraordinary  items of the Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures was $28.5  million,  a 27.5%  decrease  from the comparable period in 1999.  Net Income       As a  result  of  the  foregoing,  the  Company's  income  before  gain  on disposition, extraordinary items, and minority and preferred interests increased $8.1 million,  or 13.9%,  to $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company  recognized $9.5 million and $0.5 million in  extraordinary  charges related to the extinguishment of debt during 2000 and 1999, respectively. During 2000,  the Company  recognized an $85.3 million gain on the  disposition  of its interest  in  Lakeside.   Distributions   of  $9.0  million  to  the   Operating Partnership's  Series C and Series D Preferred  Equity owners were made in 2000, compared to $2.4  million in 1999.  After  payment of $16.6  million in Series A preferred  dividends,  net income  available to common  shareowners for 2000 was $86.4 million compared to $8.9 million in 1999.                                          24    Comparison of 1999 to 1998       Discussion  of   significant   debt,   equity,   and  other   transactions, acquisitions,  and openings  occurring in 1999 is included in Comparison of 2000 to 1999. Significant 1998 items are described below.  GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions       On September 30, 1998, the Operating  Partnership exchanged interests in 10 shopping  centers  (nine wholly  owned and one  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture), together  with  $990  million  of  debt,  for all of  GMPT's  partnership  units (approximately 50 million units with a fair value of $675 million,  based on the average  stock price of the  Company's  common shares of $13.50 for the two week period  prior  to the  closing),  providing  the  Company  with a  majority  and controlling  interest in the Operating  Partnership.  The Operating  Partnership continues to manage the centers exchanged under management agreements with GMPT. The management agreements are cancelable with 90 days notice.       In anticipation of the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating  Partnership  used the $1.2 billion  proceeds from two bridge loans to extinguish  $1.1 billion of debt in September 1998. The remaining  proceeds were used primarily to pay prepayment premiums and  transaction  costs.  GMPT's share of debt received in the exchange included  the $902  million  balance  on the  first  bridge  loan,  $86  million representing  50% of the debt on the Joint Venture owned  shopping  center,  and $1.6 million of assessment  bond  obligations.  The $340 million  balance on the second bridge loan was refinanced during the first half of 1999.       Concurrently with the GMPT Exchange the Operating Partnership, expecting to reduce  its  annual  general  and   administrative   expense,   committed  to  a restructuring of its operations and recognized a $10.7 million charge related to this  restructuring.  During 1999, general and administrative  expense decreased $6.5 million from 1998.       Because the Company's  portfolio  changed  significantly as a result of the GMPT Exchange,  the results of operations of the  transferred  centers have been separately  classified  within the  Consolidated  Businesses and  Unconsolidated Joint  Ventures for  purposes of  analyzing  and  understanding  the  historical results of the current portfolio.  Other Transactions       In November 1998, Great Lakes Crossing,  an enclosed  super-regional  mall, opened in Auburn Hills,  Michigan.  As Great Lakes  Crossing is owned by a joint venture in which the  Operating  Partnership  has a  controlling  interest,  its results are consolidated in the Company's financial statements.       At  Cherry  Creek,  a  137,000  square  foot  expansion  opened  in  stages throughout the fall of 1998.       In January 1998, the Operating Partnership redeemed a partner's 6.1 million units of partnership interest for approximately $77.7 million (including costs). The  redemption  was funded  through  the use of an  existing  revolving  credit facility.       The Company's average ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership was 63% for 1999 and 43% for 1998 (including  averages of 39% for the period through the GMPT Exchange and 63% thereafter).                                          25       Comparison of 1999 to 1998     The following table sets forth operating  results for 1999 and 1998,  showing the results of the Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:                                                            1999                                             1998                                       ------------------------------------------   ------------------------------------------------                                                         UNCONSOLIDATED                                UNCONSOLIDATED                                         CONSOLIDATED       JOINT                      CONSOLIDATED      JOINT                                          BUSINESSES(1)   VENTURES(2)       TOTAL      BUSINESSES(1)    VENTURES(2)    TOTAL                                       ------------------------------------------   ------------------------------------------------                                                                       (in millions of dollars)               REVENUES:  Minimum rents                                 133.9         158.1         292.1          99.8         149.3         249.1  Percentage rents                                4.6           3.9           8.6           5.2           3.7           8.9  Expense recoveries                             78.9          83.6         162.4          57.9          79.2         137.1  Management, leasing and   development                                   23.9                        23.9          12.3                        12.3  Other                                          16.3           6.4          22.7          17.4           6.8          24.2  Revenues-transferred centers                                                            129.7          47.2         177.0                                                -----         -----         -----         -----         -----         ----- Total revenues                                 257.6         252.0         509.6         322.3         286.3         608.6  OPERATING COSTS:  Recoverable expenses                           69.5          69.4         138.9          51.4          66.0         117.4  Other operating                                28.9          13.0          41.9          25.7          11.7          37.4  Management, leasing   and development                               17.2                        17.2           8.0                         8.0  Expenses other than interest,   depreciation and amortization   -

(3)  Amortization of the Company's additional basis in the Operating Partnership      included in equity in income before  extraordinary  items of Unconsolidated      Joint  Ventures  was $4.7  million  and  $4.5  million  in 1999  and  1998,      respectively.  Also,  amortization  of the  additional  basis  included  in      depreciation and amortization was $3.8 million and $5.1 million in 1999 and      1998, respectively. (4)  EBITDA   represents   earnings   before  interest  and   depreciation   and      amortization.   EBITDA   excludes  gains  on  dispositions  of  depreciated      operating  properties.  Funds from  Operations  is defined and discussed in      Liquidity and Capital Resources. (5)  Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.                                            26   Consolidated Businesses       Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $257.6 million,  a $65.0 million or 33.7% increase over 1998, excluding revenues of the transferred centers. Minimum rents increased $34.1 million of which $30.6 million was caused by the opening of MacArthur Center and Great Lakes Crossing.  Minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers. Expense recoveries increased primarily due to the new centers.  Revenues from management,  leasing,  and development  services increased  primarily due to the management  agreements with GMPT.  Other revenue decreased  primarily  due to a decrease  in gains on sales of  peripheral  land, partially  offset by  increases in garage and trash  removal  services and lease cancellation revenue.       Total operating costs were $237.0 million,  a $5.5 million or 2.3% decrease from 1998, excluding expenses other than depreciation, amortization and interest of the transferred  centers.  Recoverable  expenses  increased  primarily due to Great Lakes Crossing and MacArthur Center. Other operating expense increased due to an  increase  in the  charge  to  operations  for  costs  of  pre-development activities, the new centers, and bad debt expense. Costs of management,  leasing and development  services increased  primarily due to the management  agreements with GMPT. General and  administrative  expense decreased $6.5 million primarily due to  decreases  in payroll  costs,  travel and  professional  fees.  Interest expense decreased primarily due to the assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT  Exchange and debt paid down with the proceeds of the Series C and Series D Preferred  Equity  offerings,  partially  offset by an  increase in debt used to finance Great Lakes Crossing and MacArthur  Center and a decrease in capitalized interest  related  to these  centers.  Depreciation  and  amortization  expenses decreased due to the transferred centers, partially offset by an increase due to the new centers.       During 1998,  a $10.7  million loss on the  restructuring  was  recognized, which  primarily  represented  the cost of certain  involuntary  terminations of personnel.  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures       Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $252.0 million,  a $12.9  million or 5.4% increase from the  comparable  period of 1998,  excluding revenues of the transferred center. Minimum rents increased due to the expansion at Cherry Creek and tenant rollovers.  Expense recoveries also increased because of the Cherry Creek expansion and an increase in property taxes recoverable from tenants at certain centers.       Total  operating  costs  decreased by $20.2 million (of which $17.7 million represented the expenses other than interest,  depreciation, and amortization of the transferred  center) to $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Recoverable  expenses increased  primarily due to the Cherry Creek expansion and an  increase in  property  taxes at certain  centers.  Other  operating  expense increased  primarily  due to increases  in bad debt  expense.  Interest  expense decreased  primarily  due to the  assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT Exchange. Depreciation and amortization decreased due to the transferred center, offset by an increase due to the Cherry Creek expansion.       Income before  extraordinary  items of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures decreased by $14.1 million, or 15.7%, to $75.6 million.  The Company's equity in income before extraordinary items of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $39.3 million, a 15.3% decrease from the comparable period in 1998.  Net Income       As a result of the  foregoing,  the Company's  income before  extraordinary items,  minority and preferred  interests  decreased $12.0 million, or 17.0%, to $58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The Company  recognized $0.5 million in  extraordinary  losses related to the  extinguishment  of debt during 1999, while an extraordinary  charge of $50.8 million for the  extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the GMPT Exchange, was recognized in 1998. The income of the Operating Partnership allocable to minority partners increased to a total of $30.0  million,  from $6.0  million in 1998,  primarily  due to the  minority partners'   $30.7   million  share  of  the   extraordinary   charges  in  1998. Distributions of $2.4 million to the Operating Partnership's Series C and Series D Preferred  Equity owners were made in 1999.  After payment of $16.6 million in Series A preferred dividends,  net income (loss) available to common shareowners for 1999 was $8.9 million compared to $(3.0) million in 1998.                                          27   Liquidity and Capital Resources       In the following  discussion,  references to beneficial  interest represent the  Operating  Partnership's  share  of the  results  of its  consolidated  and unconsolidated  businesses.  The  Company  does not have,  and has not had,  any parent company  indebtedness;  all debt discussed represents  obligations of the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries and joint ventures.       The Company  believes that its net cash  provided by operating  activities, distributions  from its joint  ventures,  the  unutilized  portion of its credit facilities,  and its  ability  to access the  capital  markets  assure  adequate liquidity  to  conduct  its  operations  in  accordance  with its  dividend  and financing policies.       As of December 31,  2000,  the Company had a  consolidated  cash balance of $18.8  million.  Additionally,  the Company has a secured  $200  million line of credit.  This line had $63.0  million of  borrowings as of December 31, 2000 and expires in September  2001. The Company also has available a second secured bank line of credit of up to $40 million. The line had $26.3 million of borrowings as of December 31, 2000 and expires in August 2001.  Debt and Equity Transactions       Discussion of  significant  debt and equity  transactions  occurring in the three years ended  December 31, 2000 is contained in Results of  Operations.  In addition to the transactions  described therein, the following transactions have occurred  which will affect the  Company's  liquidity  and capital  resources in future periods.       In  November  2000,  the 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is developing  The  Mall  at  Millenia  closed  on a  $160.4  million  construction facility.  The rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 1.95% and the facility matures in November 2003, with two one-year extension options. The Operating Partnership has  guaranteed  the payment of 50% of the principal and interest.  The rate and the amount  guaranteed  may be reduced once certain  performance  and  valuation criteria are met. There was no balance outstanding at December 31, 2000.       In June 2000, the Operating Partnership closed on a $220 million three-year construction  facility  for The  Shops at Willow  Bend.  The rate on the loan is LIBOR plus 1.85%. The loan has two one-year  extension  options.  The balance at December 31, 2000 was $99.7 million.       In March 2000, the Company's Board of Directors  authorized the purchase of up to $50 million of the  Company's  common stock in the open market.  The stock may be purchased from time to time as market conditions  warrant. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had purchased 2.3 million shares for  approximately  $25.8 million.       In June 2000, the Company  finalized an agreement that  securitized the $40 million bank line of credit and extended its maturity to August 2001.       In  November  1999,  the 26% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is developing   International   Plaza  closed  on  a  $193.5  million,   three-year construction  financing,  with a  one-year  extension  option.  The  rate on the facility  is LIBOR plus  1.90%.  The  balance  at  December  31,  2000 was $67.5 million.       In  October  1999,  the 50%  owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is developing  Dolphin  Mall  closed  on a $200  million,  three-year  construction facility.  The rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 2%,  decreasing  to LIBOR plus 1.75% when a certain coverage ratio is met. The rate on the loan is capped at 7% plus credit spread until maturity.  Under the interest rate agreement,  the rate is swapped to a fixed rate of 6.14%, plus credit spread, when LIBOR is less than 6.7%.  The maturity  date may be extended one year.  The balance at December 31, 2000 was $116.9 million.                                          28    Summary of Investing Activities       Net cash used in investing  activities  was $219.7 million in 2000 compared to $197.4  million in 1999 and $270.0  million in 1998.  Cash used in  investing activities was impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, with additions to properties in 2000,  1999, and 1998 for the  construction  of MacArthur  Center, Great Lakes Crossing, The Mall at Wellington Green, The Shops at Willow Bend, as well as other  development  activities  and other  capital  items  (see  Capital Spending below). During 2000, $3.0 million was invested in MerchantWired,  while in 1999,  $18.5  million was used to purchase  investments  in  Fashionmall.com, Inc., Swerdlow Real Estate Group, and Lord Associates. In addition, during 2000, $23.6 million in costs were incurred (net of cash  acquired) in connection  with the exchange of interests in centers.  Proceeds  from sales of  peripheral  land increased  in  2000  by  $6.4  million,   to  $8.2  million.   Contributions  to Unconsolidated   Joint  Ventures  are  impacted   primarily  by  the  timing  of construction  and expansion  activities,  which in 2000, 1999, and 1998 included significant projects at Dolphin Mall, International Plaza, The Mall at Millenia, Fair Oaks, Lakeside, Twelve Oaks, Cherry Creek, and Woodland. Distributions from Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures  decreased in 2000 due to the transfers of Twelve Oaks and  Lakeside.  Also,  distributions  from  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures included  excess  mortgage  refinancing  proceeds of $45.2  million in 1999 from Cherry  Creek and $45.9  million  in 1998 from Fair Oaks.  In 1998,  the loss of distributions from Woodfield after the GMPT Exchange were offset by increases in distributions at other centers.  Summary of Financing Activities       Financing  activities  contributed  cash of $99.7  million  in 2000,  $91.3 million in 1999,  and $131.3  million in 1998.  Borrowings net of repayments and issuance  costs  increased by $130.3 million to $231.2 million in 2000. In 1999, borrowings net of debt repayments and issuance costs decreased by $244.5 million from 1998 to $100.9 million. In 1999, $97.3 million was provided by the issuance of preferred equity.       Distributions and dividends were $107.5 million, $100.1 million, and $131.2 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Distributions were higher in 1998 due to the Company's larger pre-GMPT Exchange equity base.  Approximately  $24.2 million was used in 2000 to repurchase  common shares under the stock repurchase program  initiated in 2000. In 1998, cash was used for the $77.7 million partner redemption and transaction costs incurred in connection with the GMPT Exchange.                                          29   Beneficial Interest in Debt       At December 31, 2000, the Operating  Partnership's  debt and its beneficial interest  in the debt of its  Consolidated  and  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures totaled $1,588.7 million. As shown in the following table, there was no unhedged floating  rate debt at December  31, 2000.  Interest  rates shown do not include amortization of debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs. These items are reported as interest expense in the results of operations. In the aggregate, these costs added 0.45% to the effective rate of interest on beneficial interest in debt at December 31, 2000.  Included in  beneficial  interest in debt is debt used to fund development and expansion costs.  Beneficial  interest in assets on which  interest is being  capitalized  totaled $499.8 million as of December 31, 2000. Beneficial interest in capitalized interest was $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

In addition  the debt      is capped at 7%. The notional amounts on both the cap and the swap increase      from $150 million to $200 million in February 2001. (4)  This cap which was  purchased  to hedge a  construction  facility  of a 50%      owned joint venture has a notional amount of $80.2 million. (5)  The  notional  amount on the cap,  which  hedges a  construction  facility,      accretes $7 million a month until it reaches $147 million. (6)  An additional cap was purchased by the 90% owned consolidated joint venture      to hedge an anticipated  construction  facility.  The 7.25% cap begins at a      notional  amount of $6 million in January  2001 and accretes $6 million per      month up to $70 million. This cap also expires in September 2003.    Sensitivity Analysis       The Company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt  obligations and interest  rate  instruments.  Based on the  Operating  Partnership's  beneficial interest  in debt and  interest  rates in effect at  December  31,  2000,  a one percent  increase in interest  rates on floating  rate debt would  decrease cash flows by  approximately  $3.2  million  and,  due to the  effect of  capitalized interest,  annual earnings by approximately $1.8 million. A one percent decrease in interest  rates on floating  rate debt would  increase  cash flows and annual earnings by approximately $6.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively.  Based on the  Company's  consolidated  debt and interest  rates in effect at December 31, 2000, a one percent  increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by  approximately  $40.9 million,  while a one percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $44.0 million.                                          30   Covenants and Commitments       Certain loan agreements  contain various  restrictive  covenants  including limitations  on net worth,  minimum  debt  service  and fixed  charges  coverage ratios, a maximum payout ratio on distributions, and a minimum debt yield ratio, the  latter  being  the  most  restrictive.  The  Operating  Partnership  is  in compliance with all of such covenants.       Payments of principal and interest on the loans in the following  table are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2000. All of the loan agreements  provide for a reduction of the amounts  guaranteed as certain center performance and valuation criteria are met.

In addition, the Operating Partnership guarantees the $100 million facility secured by an  interest  in Twelve  Oaks that was  obtained  in August 2000 (See Results of Operations - Significant Debt, Equity, and Other Transactions).  Funds from Operations       A principal factor that the Company  considers in determining  dividends to shareowners is Funds from  Operations  (FFO),  which is defined as income before extraordinary  items,  real  estate  depreciation  and  amortization,   and  the allocation to the minority interest in the Operating Partnership, less preferred dividends and  distributions.  Gains on  dispositions  of depreciated  operating properties are excluded from FFO.       Funds from  Operations  does not represent cash flows from  operations,  as defined  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,   and  should  not  be considered  to be an  alternative  to net income as an  indicator  of  operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. However, the National  Association of Real Estate  Investment  Trusts suggests that Funds from Operations is a useful  supplemental  measure of operating  performance for REITs.       In October 1999,  NAREIT approved certain  clarifications of the definition of  FFO,   including   that   non-recurring   items  that  are  not  defined  as "extraordinary"   under  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  should  be reflected in the  calculation  of FFO.  The  clarified  definition  is effective January 1, 2000 and restatement of all periods  presented is recommended.  Under the  clarified  definition,  there  would  have been no  change  to the  amounts reported for 1999.                                          31   Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds from Operations                                                                         2000                         1999                                                                      ----                         ----                                                                         (in millions of dollars)      Income before gain on disposition of center,   extraordinary items, and minority and preferred interests (1) (2)   66.5                         58.4 Depreciation and amortization (3)                                     57.8                         52.5 Share of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures'    depreciation and amortization (4)                                  19.4                         20.4 Non-real estate depreciation                                          (3.0)                        (2.7) Preferred dividends and distributions                                (25.6)                       (19.0) Minority interest share of depreciation                               (2.4)                        (0.7)                                                                       ----                        ----- Funds from Operations                                                112.7                        108.9                                                                      =====                        ===== Funds from Operations allocable to the Company                        70.4                         68.5                                                                       ====                       ======   (1)  Includes  gains on  peripheral  land sales of $9.1 million and $1.5 million      for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash  available to the Company,  its financial condition,  capital and other requirements,  and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.  Preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings, cash availability, or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends.       On December 12, 2000,  the Company  declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.25 per common share payable  January 22, 2001 to  shareowners of record on December 29, 2000. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.51875 per share on the Company's 8.3% Series A Preferred Stock, paid December 29, 2000 to shareowners of record on December 19, 2000.                                          32        Common dividends declared totaled $0.985 per common share in 2000, of which $0.4402 represented return of capital,  $0.4799 represented ordinary income, and $0.0649  represented  capital  gain,  compared to dividends  declared in 1999 of $0.965 per common  share,  of which  $0.4534  represented  return of capital and $0.5116  represented  ordinary  income.  The tax  status  of total  2001  common dividends  declared and to be  declared,  assuming  continuation  of a $0.25 per common share quarterly dividend,  is estimated to be approximately 30% return of capital,  and  approximately 70% ordinary income.  Series A preferred  dividends declared  were $2.075 per  preferred  share in 2000 and 1999,  of which  $1.9382 represented ordinary income and $0.1368 represented capital gains in 2000, while the entire dividend represented ordinary income in 1999. The tax status of total 2001  dividends  to be paid on Series A Preferred  Stock is estimated to be 100% ordinary income.  These are  forward-looking  statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially,  including:  1) the amount of dividends  declared;  2) changes in the Company's share of anticipated taxable  income of the Operating  Partnership  due to the actual  results of the Operating  Partnership;  3) changes in the number of the  Company's  outstanding shares;  4) property  acquisitions or dispositions;  5) financing  transactions, including  refinancing of existing debt; and 6) changes in the Internal  Revenue Code or its application.       The annual  determination  of the  Company's  common  dividends is based on anticipated Funds from Operations available after preferred  dividends,  as well as financing considerations and other appropriate factors.  Further, the Company has decided that the growth in common  dividends will be less than the growth in Funds from Operations for the immediate future.       Any inability of the Operating  Partnership or its Joint Ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts,  capital  expenditures and changes in working capital, including development activities and expansions, may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such  obligations,  thereby possibly reducing distributions  to partners of the Operating  Partnership  and funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends.  Capital Spending       Capital  spending  for  routine  maintenance  of the  shopping  centers  is generally recovered from tenants. Capital spending not recovered from tenants is summarized in the following tables:                                                                                  2000                                                 -------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                       Beneficial Interest in                                                                   Unconsolidated      Consolidated Businesses                                                 Consolidated           Joint            and Unconsolidated                                                  Businesses          Ventures (1)         Joint Ventures (1)(2)                                                 --------------------------------------------------------------                                                            (in millions of dollars)        Development, renovation, and expansion:    Existing centers                                 14.3               19.5                  23.2    New centers                                     149.2(3)           226.3(4)              241.7 Pre-construction development activities,   net of charge to operations                        6.1                                      6.1 Mall tenant allowances                              10.2                4.3                  11.8 Corporate office improvements, equipment,   and software                                       3.1                                      3.1 Other                                                0.2                2.2                   1.4                                                    -----              -----                 ----- Total                                              183.1              252.3                 287.3                                                    =====              =====                 =====   (1)  Costs are net of intercompany profits.

(2)  Includes  the  Operating  Partnership's  share of  construction  costs  for      MacArthur  Center (a 70% owned  consolidated  joint  venture),  The Mall at      Wellington Green (a 90% owned  consolidated  joint venture),  International      Plaza (a 26% owned unconsolidated  joint venture),  and Dolphin Mall (a 50%      owned unconsolidated joint venture). (3)  Includes  costs related to MacArthur  Center,  The Shops at Willow Bend and      The Mall at Wellington Green. (4)  Includes costs related to Dolphin Mall and International Plaza.         The Operating Partnership's share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased during the year,  excluding  expansion  space and new  developments,  was $16.39 in 2000 and $12.76 in 1999.  In  addition,  the  Operating  Partnership's share of capitalized leasing costs in 2000, excluding new developments, was $7.6 million,  or $10.54 per square foot leased and $6.2 million or $10.82 per square foot leased during the year in 1999.       In September  1999,  the Company  finalized a  partnership  agreement  with Swerdlow Real Estate Group to jointly develop Dolphin Mall, a 1.4 million square foot value regional center located in Miami, Florida. The center opened in March 2001.  Although  certain  permitting and certificate of occupancy issues limited the  Company's  ability to  maximize  occupancy  at opening,  approximately  150 retailers  opened  initially with an additional 50 tenants opening over a two to three month period.  Dolphin is presently  anticipated to cost up to $20 million higher than  originally  projected or  approximately  $290 million.  The Company currently  estimates an unleveraged  return of  approximately  9% in 2001 on its share of average  spending of approximately  $145 million.  The returns for 2002 and 2003 are expected to be approximately 10.5% and 11.0%, respectively.       The  Shops  at  Willow  Bend,  a  1.5  million  square  foot  center  under construction  in Plano,  Texas,  will be anchored by Neiman  Marcus,  Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor, Foley's and Dillard's. The center is scheduled to open in August 2001; Saks Fifth Avenue will open in 2004. The Mall at Wellington  Green, a 1.3 million square foot center under  construction  in west Palm Beach County, Florida,  will initially be anchored by Lord & Taylor,  Burdines,  Dillard's and JCPenney. A fifth anchor,  Nordstrom, is obligated under the reciprocal easement agreement to open within 24 months of the opening of the center and is presently expected to open in 2003. The center, scheduled to open in October 2001, will be owned  by a  joint  venture  in  which  the  Operating  Partnership  has  a  90% controlling interest.       Additionally,  the Company is developing International Plaza, a 1.3 million square foot center  under  construction  in Tampa,  Florida.  The center will be anchored  by  Nordstrom,  Lord & Taylor,  Dillard's  and Neiman  Marcus,  and is scheduled to open in September  2001.  The Company  originally had a controlling 50.1% interest in the partnership  (Tampa Westshore) that owns the project.  The Company was responsible for providing the funding for project costs in excess of construction  financing in exchange for a preferential return. In November 1999, the Company entered into agreements with a new investor,  which provided funding for the  project  and  thereby  reduced  the  Company's  ownership  interest  to approximately  26%.  It  is  anticipated  that  given  the  preferential  return arrangements,  the original  49.9% owner in Tampa  Westshore  will not initially receive  cash  distributions.  The  Company  expects to be  initially  allocated approximately 33% of the net operating income of the project, with an additional 7% representing return of capital.                                          34         The  Company  expects  returns  on The Mall at Willow  Bend,  International Plaza,  and The Mall at Wellington  Green to average  slightly under 10% for the four months on average that these  centers will be open in 2001.  The  Company's share of costs for the three  centers  is  projected  to be  approximately  $525 million  during  these four months.  For 2002,  the Company  expects  returns to average above 10.5% on approximately  $565 million of costs and in 2003, expects returns of 11%.  These  returns  exclude  land sale  gains  upon which  interest expense  savings  on the gains  will add  approximately  0.25% to the  projects' returns, based on interest savings due to the reduction of debt.       The Operating  Partnership  has entered into a joint venture to develop The Mall at Millenia currently under construction in Orlando,  Florida. This project is expected to open in October  2002.  The Mall at Millenia  will be anchored by Bloomingdale's, Macy's, and Neiman Marcus.       The total cost, prior to anticipated recoveries,  of these five projects is anticipated  to  be  approximately  $1.3  billion.   The  Company's   beneficial investment in the projects will be approximately $810 million,  as four of these projects are joint ventures.  While the Company intends to finance approximately 75% of each new center with  construction  debt, the Company is responsible  for more than its  proportionate  share of the project  equity  (approximately  $259 million).  Substantially  all  of the  project  equity  for  the  five  projects currently under construction has been funded through the Operating Partnership's preferred equity offerings,  contributions from the new joint venture partner in the  International  Plaza project,  and borrowings  under the Company's lines of credit.  With respect to the construction loan financing,  the Company completed financings for Dolphin Mall, The Shops at Willow Bend,  International Plaza, and The Mall at Millenia.  The financing of The Mall at Wellington Green is expected to be completed in the first half of 2001.       Additionally, food courts at Twelve Oaks, in the suburban Detroit area, and Woodland in Grand  Rapids,  Michigan are  scheduled to open in the fall of 2001. The Operating  Partnership's  share of the cost of these projects is expected to be approximately $12.5 million.       The Operating Partnership and The Mills Corporation have formed an alliance to develop value  super-regional  projects in major  metropolitan  markets.  The ten-year  agreement  calls for the two  companies to jointly  develop and own at least seven of these centers,  each representing  approximately  $200 million of capital  investment.  A number of  locations  across the nation are targeted for future initiatives.       The following  table  summarizes  planned  capital  spending,  which is not recovered from tenants and assumes no acquisitions during 2001:                                                                                2001                                              -----------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                      Beneficial Interest in                                                                 Unconsolidated       Consolidated Businesses                                              Consolidated            Joint             and Unconsolidated                                               Businesses         Ventures (1)         Joint Ventures (1)(2)                                              -----------------------------------------------------------------                                                            (in millions of dollars)         Development, renovation, and expansion          194.2(3)             305.8(4)                 313.5 Mall tenant allowances                            9.5                  6.4                     12.4 Pre-construction development and other           15.5                  0.5                     15.7                                                 -----                -----                    ----- Total                                           219.2                312.7                    341.6                                                 =====                =====                    =====   (1)  Costs are net of intercompany profits. (2)  Includes the Operating  Partnership's  share of construction  costs for The      Mall  at  Wellington  Green  (a  90%  owned  consolidated  joint  venture),      International  Plaza (a 26% owned  unconsolidated  joint venture),  Dolphin      Mall (a 50% owned unconsolidated  joint venture),  and The Mall at Millenia      (a 50% owned unconsolidated joint venture). (3)  Includes  costs  related  to The  Shops  at  Willow  Bend  and The  Mall at      Wellington Green.

Estimates of future  capital  spending  include only  projects approved by the Company's Board of Directors and,  consequently,  estimates will change as new projects are approved.  Estimates  regarding capital  expenditures presented above are  forward-looking  statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ  materially,  including but not limited to: 1) actual results of negotiations with anchors, tenants and contractors;  2) changes  in the scope and number of  projects;  3) cost  overruns;  4) timing of expenditures; 5) financing considerations;  6) actual time to complete projects; 7) changes in economic climate;  8) competition from others  attracting  tenants and customers; and 9) increases in operating costs.  Cash Tender Agreement       A. Alfred  Taubman has the annual  right to tender to the Company  units of partnership interest in the Operating  Partnership  (provided that the aggregate value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender Agreement).  At A. Alfred Taubman's election, his family, and certain others may participate  in  tenders.  The  Company  will  have the  option to pay for these interests  from  available  cash,  borrowed  funds,  or from the  proceeds of an offering of the  Company's  common  stock.  Generally,  the  Company  expects to finance  these  purchases  through  the sale of new  shares  of its  stock.  The tendering  partner  will bear all market risk if the market  price at closing is less than the  purchase  price and will bear the costs of sale.  Any proceeds of the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of the Company.       Based on a market  value at December  31, 2000 of $10.94 per common  share, the  aggregate  value of  interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  that may be tendered under the Cash Tender  Agreement was  approximately  $264 million.  The purchase  of these  interests  at December  31, 2000 would have  resulted in the Company owning an additional 29% interest in the Operating Partnership.  New Accounting Pronouncement       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  133 requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the balance  sheet as assets and liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of the  derivatives  and whether  they qualify for hedge  accounting.  SFAS 133, as amended and interpreted,  is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  The  Company's   derivatives  consist  primarily  of  interest  rate  cap agreements  which the Company  purchases  to reduce its exposure to increases in rates on its floating rate debt. The Company  expects that the primary impact of its adoption of SFAS 133 will be the timing of the  recognition in income of the costs of these  agreements.  This may cause earnings  volatility as the value of these  agreements  may change  from  period to  period.  In  addition,  the swap agreement  on the  Dolphin  Mall  construction  loan does not  qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. As a result,  the Company will recognize its share of losses and income  related to this  agreement  in  earnings  as the value of the agreement  changes.  The Company expects to recognize an unrealized loss on this agreement  of  approximately  $1  million  in the first  quarter  because of the decline in interest rates since year end.       The  Company  will  recognize  a loss of  approximately  $8.8  million as a transition  adjustment  to mark its share of interest  rate  agreements  to fair value as of January 1, 2001, the Company's  transition  date. Of this amount,  a $0.8  million  loss  will be  charged  to other  comprehensive  income  with the remainder   representing  the  cumulative  effect  of  a  change  in  accounting principle.                                          36    Item 7A.
