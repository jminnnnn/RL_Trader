Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ---------------------------------------------    The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and the  Financial  Statements  of  Taubman  Centers,  Inc.  and the  Notes thereto.  General Background and Performance Measurement    The Company owns a managing general  partner's  interest in The Taubman Realty Group Limited  Partnership  (Operating  Partnership),  through which the Company conducts  all of its  operations.  The  Operating  Partnership  owns,  develops, acquires,  and operates regional shopping centers  nationally.  The Consolidated Businesses  consist of shopping  centers  that are  controlled  by  ownership or contractual agreement, development projects for future regional shopping centers and The Taubman Company Limited Partnership (the Manager). Shopping centers that are not  controlled and that are owned through joint ventures with third parties (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.    The operations of the shopping  centers are best understood by measuring their performance  as a whole,  without  regard to the Company's  ownership  interest. Consequently,   in  addition  to  the   discussion  of  the  operations  of  the Consolidated Businesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented and discussed as a whole.    On September 30, 1998,  the Operating  Partnership  exchanged  interests in 10 shopping centers (nine Consolidated Businesses (Briarwood, Columbus City Center, The Falls, Hilltop, Lakeforest,  Marley Station, Meadowood Mall, Stoneridge, and The Mall at Tuttle Crossing) and one Unconsolidated  Joint Venture  (Woodfield)) and a share of the Operating Partnership's debt for all of the partnership units owned by General  Motors  Pension Trusts (GMPT) (the GMPT Exchange - see Results of Operations -- GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions). Performance statistics presented  below include  these ten centers  (transferred  centers)  through the completion  of the  GMPT  Exchange,  except  as  noted.  Because  the  Company's portfolio changed significantly as a result of the GMPT Exchange, the results of operations of the transferred centers have been separately classified within the Consolidated  Businesses  and  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  for  purposes of analyzing and understanding the historical results of the current portfolio.    Since the Company's  interest in the Operating  Partnership  has been its sole material  asset  throughout all periods  presented,  references in the following discussion to "the  Company"  include the  Operating  Partnership,  except where intercompany  transactions are discussed or as otherwise noted,  even though the Operating  Partnership did not become a consolidated  subsidiary until September 30, 1998.  Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues   Over the long term, the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant  of revenues of the shopping  centers  because mall tenants  provide approximately  90% of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent,  percentage  rent, and  recoverable  expenses  (together,  total occupancy  costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay.  However,  levels of mall tenant  sales can be  considerably  more  volatile  in the short run than  total occupancy  costs.      The Company believes  that the  ability  of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn  profits  over long  periods of time  increases  as sales per  square  foot increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot.                                           20        The following table summarizes occupancy costs, excluding utilities,  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales.

Occupancy    Historically,  average annual  occupancy has been within a narrow band. In the last ten years,  average  annual  occupancy has ranged  between 86.5% and 89.4%. Mall tenant average  occupancy,  ending  occupancy and leased space rates are as follows:                                                Current Portfolio                      Historical Portfolio (1)                                              -----------------                     ------------------------    Mall Tenant Average Occupancy       1998                                        89.4%                                      89.0%       1997                                        88.0                                       87.6    Ending Occupancy       1998                                        90.2%       1997                                        90.7    Leased Space       1998                                        92.3%       1997                                        92.7     (1) Includes transferred centers through the date of the GMPT Exchange.  Rental Rates    As leases have expired in the shopping centers, the Company has generally been able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. In a period of increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In  periods  of  slower  growth or declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason.  However,  Center revenues  nevertheless  increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current  rental  rates that are usually  higher  than the  average  rates for existing leases. The following table contains certain information  regarding per square foot base rent at the shopping  centers that have been owned and open for five years.                                            Current Portfolio                                          -----------------                                          1998        1997                                          ----        ----    Average Base Rent per square foot:       All mall tenants                  $41.93     $41.37       Stores closing during the year    $44.27     $39.07       Stores opening during the year    $47.92     $41.08                                              21      Seasonality    The regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall tenant sales  highest in the  fourth  quarter  due to the  Christmas  season,  and with lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and  back-to-school  events.  While  minimum  rents and  recoveries  are generally not subject to seasonal  factors,  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter,  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Accordingly,  revenues and occupancy  levels are generally  highest in the fourth quarter.  Because the seasonality of sales  contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and  recoveries,  mall  tenant  occupancy  costs  (the  sum  of  minimum  rents, percentage  rents and expense  recoveries)  relative  to sales are  considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter.                                        22      Results of Operations    The following represent  significant debt and equity transactions,  new center openings,  acquisitions  and  expansions  which  affect  the  operating  results described under Comparison of Fiscal Year 1998 to Fiscal Year 1997.  GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions    On September 30, 1998,  the Operating  Partnership  exchanged  interests in 10 shopping  centers  (nine wholly  owned and one  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture), together  with  $990  million  of  debt,  for all of  GMPT's  partnership  units (approximately 50 million units with a fair value of $675 million,  based on the average  stock price of the  Company's  common shares of $13.50 for the two week period  prior  to the  closing),  providing  the  Company  with a  majority  and controlling  interest  in the  Operating  Partnership.  As a result  of the GMPT Exchange,   the  Company's  general   partnership   interest  in  the  Operating Partnership  increased  to  62.8% of the  approximately  84.3  million  units of partnership  interest  outstanding.  The Operating  Partnership will continue to manage the centers  exchanged under management  agreements with GMPT that expire December 31, 1999. The management agreements are cancelable with 90 days notice.    In anticipation of the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating Partnership used the $1.2 billion  proceeds from two bridge loans bearing interest at one month LIBOR plus 1.30% to extinguish  $1.1 billion of debt,  including  substantially  all of the Operating Partnership's public unsecured debt, its outstanding commercial paper, and borrowings on its existing line of credit.  The remaining proceeds were used primarily to pay prepayment  premiums and transaction  costs.  An  extraordinary charge of  approximately  $49.8  million,  consisting  primarily  of  prepayment premiums, was incurred in connection with the extinguishment of the debt. GMPT's share of debt received in the exchange  included the $902 million balance on the first bridge loan, $86 million representing 50% of the debt on the Joint Venture owned shopping  center,  and $1.6 million of assessment bond  obligations.  (See Liquidity and Capital  Resources  below  regarding  the Operating  Partnership's beneficial interest in debt and its plans to refinance its bridge loan.)    Concurrently with the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating Partnership committed to a restructuring of its operations.  A restructuring  charge of approximately $10.7 million was  incurred,  consisting  primarily  of costs  related to  involuntary termination of personnel.  The Company expects to reduce its annual consolidated general and administrative expense to approximately $19 million in 1999. This is a forward-looking  statement,  and certain  significant  factors could cause the actual reductions in general and  administrative  expense to differ  materially, including but not limited to: 1) actual payroll reductions  achieved;  2) actual results of negotiations;  3) use of outside  consultants;  and 4) changes in the Company's owned or managed portfolio.  Other Debt and Equity Transactions    In January 1998,  the Operating  Partnership  redeemed a partner's 6.1 million units of partnership interest for approximately $77.7 million (including costs). The  redemption  was funded  through  the use of an  existing  revolving  credit facility.    In October 1997,  the Company used the $200 million  public  offering of eight million shares of 8.3% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock to acquire a  preferred  equity  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership.  The  Operating Partnership  used the net  proceeds  to pay down debt under  existing  revolving credit and commercial paper facilities,  which were used to fund the acquisition of Regency Square in September 1997.                                                    23      Openings, Expansions and Acquisitions    In  November  1998,  Great  Lakes  Crossing,   an  80%  owned  enclosed  value super-regional mall, opened in Auburn  Hills,  Michigan.  The center  opened 95% leased.   In  November   1997,   Arizona  Mills,  a  37%  owned  enclosed  value super-regional shopping center located in Tempe, Arizona, opened 90% leased.    At Cherry Creek, a 132,000 square foot expansion  opened in stages  throughout the fall of 1998. A 135,000 square foot expansion  opened at Westfarms in August 1997. In addition, approximately 50,000 square feet of new mall stores opened at Biltmore in 1997.    In September 1997, the Operating Partnership acquired Regency Square (Regency) shopping center, located in Richmond,  Virginia, for $123.9 million in cash. The operating  results of Regency have been reflected in the Company's  results from the acquisition date.    In December 1997, the Operating Partnership acquired The Falls shopping center and the leasehold interest in The Mall at Tuttle Crossing,  which opened in July 1997. These two centers were transferred to GMPT.  Memorial City Mall Lease    In November 1996, the Operating Partnership entered into an agreement to lease Memorial City Mall (Memorial  City),  a 1.4 million square foot shopping  center located in Houston,  Texas. The lease of this  unencumbered  property grants the Operating  Partnership  the  exclusive  right to manage,  lease and  operate the property.  The Operating Partnership has the option to terminate the lease after the third full lease year by paying $2  million  to the  lessor.  The  Operating Partnership   is  using  this  option  period  to  evaluate  the   redevelopment opportunities of the center.  As a development  project,  Memorial City has been excluded  from all  operating  statistics  in this report,  and Memorial  City's results of  operations  have been  presented as a net line item in the following tabular comparisons of results of operations.  Memorial City is expected to have an immaterial effect on EBITDA and net income during the option period.  Presentation of Operating Results    In order to facilitate the analysis of the ongoing  business for periods prior to the GMPT  Exchange,  the  following  tables  contain the  combined  operating results of the Company and the Operating Partnership and also present separately the revenues and expenses,  other than interest,  depreciation and amortization, of the transferred  centers.  The following  discussions include analysis of the Consolidated Businesses and the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, with the interest of the  noncontrolling  partners  of the  Operating  Partnership  (the  Minority Interest)  deducted  to  arrive  at  the  results  allocable  to  the  Company's shareowners.  Because the Operating  Partnership's net equity is less than zero, for periods subsequent to the GMPT Exchange the income allocated to the Minority Interest  is equal  to the  Minority  Interest's  share  of  distributions.  The Operating  Partnership's  net  equity  is  less  than  zero  due to  accumulated distributions  in excess of net income and not as a result of operating  losses. Distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes  non-cash  charges for  depreciation  and  amortization.

Minimum rents increased $13.4 million, of which $8.9 million was due to the opening of Great Lakes  Crossing and the  acquisition of Regency. Minimum  rents also  increased  because of the  expansion at Biltmore and tenant rollovers.  Expense recoveries  increased  primarily due to Great Lakes Crossing and  Regency.  Revenues  from  management,   leasing  and  development  services increased  primarily  due to the new  management  agreements  with  GMPT.  Other revenue  increased  primarily due to an increase in gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation revenue.      Total operating  costs increased $22.8 million,  or 8.6%, to $286.8 million. Recoverable and other operating  expenses  increased due to Great Lakes Crossing and Regency.  Other operating  expense also increased due to professional  fees, management  expense  and an increase  in the charge to  operations  for costs of potentially unsuccessful pre-development activities.  General and administrative expense  decreased $2.1 million  between periods due to decreases in payroll and reduced employee  relocation and recruiter costs,  partially offset by increases attributable to the phase-in of the long term compensation plan.    Interest  expense  increased due to an increase in debt used to finance Tuttle Crossing,  the  acquisition  of The  Falls  and the  redemption  of a  partner's interest in the Operating  Partnership,  partially  offset by a decrease in debt paid down with the proceeds of the October 1997 and April 1998 equity  offerings and the  assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT  Exchange.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased due to Great Lakes Crossing, Tuttle Crossing, Regency and The Falls,  partially  offset by the  decrease in expense due to the transferred  centers  only being  included in 1998  through the date of the GMPT Exchange.    Revenues and expenses other than interest and depreciation for the transferred centers for 1998 represent operations through the date of the GMPT Exchange. The resulting decreases from 1997 were partially offset by increases in revenues and expenses due to the acquisition of The Falls and the opening of Tuttle Crossing.    During 1998, a $10.7 million loss on the restructuring  was recognized,  which primarily represented the cost of certain involuntary terminations of personnel.  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - -----------------------------    Total  revenues  for 1998 were  $286.3  million,  a $27.5  million,  or 10.6%, increase  from 1997.  The increase in minimum rents and expense  recoveries  was primarily due to Arizona Mills and the expansions at Westfarms and Cherry Creek. Minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers. Other revenue decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to a decrease in gains on peripheral land sales.    Total operating costs increased by $30.3 million,  or 18.2%, to $196.7 million for 1998.  Recoverable and  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses  increased primarily  due to Arizona  Mills and the  expansions.  Other  operating  expense increased  primarily due to Arizona Mills.  Interest expense increased primarily due to an  increase  in debt used to  finance  Arizona  Mills and the  Westfarms expansion, and a decrease in capitalized interest related to these two projects.    Revenues and expenses other than interest and depreciation for the transferred centers for 1998 represent the  operations of Woodfield  through the date of the GMPT Exchange, resulting in decreases from the prior year.    As a  result  of the  foregoing,  income  before  extraordinary  item  of the Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  decreased by $2.7  million,  or 2.9%,  to $89.7 million.  The  Company's  equity  in  income  before  extraordinary  item of the Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  was $46.4  million,  a 4.9%  decrease  from the comparable period in 1997.                                          26      Net Income - ----------    As a result of the foregoing,  the Company's income before extraordinary items and Minority Interest decreased to $70.4 million for 1998. The Minority Interest in the  Company's  results  decreased  to  $6.0  million,  from  $57.8  million, reflecting the Company's increased ownership in the Operating Partnership due to the  GMPT  Exchange  and  other  equity  transactions,  as well as the  Minority Interest's $30.7 million share of the 1998 extraordinary items.    Also,  the Company  recognized  its $20.1  million  share of $50.8  million in extraordinary  charges  related to the  extinguishment  of debt,  including debt extinguished  in  anticipation  of the GMPT  Exchange,  primarily  consisting of prepayment  premiums.  After  payment  of $16.6  million  in Series A  preferred dividends, net income (loss) available to common shareowners for 1998 was $(3.0) million compared to $24.6 million for 1997.  Comparison of Fiscal Year 1997 to Fiscal Year 1996    Discussion of  significant  debt and equity  transactions,  acquisitions,  and openings  occurring in 1997 is included in the Comparison of Fiscal Year 1998 to Fiscal Year 1997. Significant 1996 items are described below.    In December 1996, the Company acquired an additional interest in the Operating Partnership  with the proceeds  from the  Company's  December  1996  offering of common stock. The Operating  Partnership used the net proceeds to pay down short term floating rate debt and to acquire La Cumbre  Plaza.  Additionally  in 1996, the Operating  Partnership  issued units of  partnership  interest in connection with the  acquisition  of the 75%  remaining  interest in Fairlane  Town Center. These units were redeemed by the Operating Partnership in January 1998. Prior to the acquisition date, the Company's  interest in Fairlane (through the Operating Partnership)  was  accounted  for under the equity  method as an  Unconsolidated Joint Venture.  Additionally, in June 1996, the Operating Partnership acquired a 100% leasehold  interest in Paseo Nuevo,  located in Santa Barbara,  California, for $37 million in cash.

(5)  Certain  1997 and 1996  amounts  have been reclassified to conform to 1998      classifications.                                               28     Consolidated Businesses - -----------------------    Total revenues for 1997 were $301.6 million, a $39.4 million or 15.0% increase over 1996.  Minimum rents  increased  $17.0 million,  of which $15.1 million was caused by the 1997 and 1996  acquisitions.  The  results of  Fairlane  have been consolidated  in  the  Operating   Partnership's   results   subsequent  to  the acquisition  date in July 1996 (prior to that date  Fairlane was  accounted  for under the equity method as an Unconsolidated Joint Venture).  Minimum rents also increased due to the expansion at Biltmore and tenant rollovers. Percentage rent and  expense  recoveries  increased  primarily  due to the  acquisitions.  Other revenue  increased  $2.2  million  primarily  due to an  insurance  recovery,  a litigation  settlement,  and an  increase  in lease  cancellation  revenue.  The transferred  centers' total revenues  increased  primarily due to the opening of Tuttle Crossing.    Total  operating  costs  increased  $29.0 million,  or 12.3%.  Recoverable and depreciation  and  amortization   expenses   increased   primarily  due  to  the acquisitions.   Other  operating  expenses   increased   primarily  due  to  the acquisitions,  offset by a  decrease  in the charge to  operations  for costs of potentially unsuccessful pre-development activities. General and administrative expense  increased by $4.0 million  primarily  due to increases in  compensation (including  the  continuing  phase-in  of  the  long-term   compensation  plan), recruiter fees and relocation  charges,  travel, and training.  Interest expense increased due to an increase in debt used to finance Tuttle Crossing and capital expenditures at other Consolidated  Businesses,  partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest.  The acquisitions were initially funded with debt which was  subsequently  paid down with the proceeds  from the  December  1996 and the October 1997 equity issuances.  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - -----------------------------    Total revenues for 1997 were $258.8 million, a $6.5 million, or 2.5%, decrease from  1996,  representing  a $15.0  million  decrease  caused  by the  change of Fairlane from an Unconsolidated Joint Venture to a Consolidated Business, offset by  increases  due to the  openings  of  Arizona  Mills  and  the  expansion  at Westfarms,  in addition to increases at other  centers.  The decrease in minimum rents was  primarily  due to Fairlane,  offset by Arizona  Mills,  Westfarms and increases  due to tenant  rollovers  at other  centers.  The decrease in expense recoveries was primarily due to Fairlane, offset by Arizona Mills. Other revenue increased  by $0.4  million  primarily  due to gains on  peripheral  land sales, offset by a decrease in lease cancellation revenue and interest income.    Total operating  costs  decreased by $4.7 million,  or 2.7%, to $166.4 million for  1997  including  a $10.1  million  decrease  due to  Fairlane.  Recoverable expenses  decreased $4.6 million primarily due to Fairlane,  offset by increases due to Arizona Mills. Other operating costs decreased  primarily due to Fairlane and a  decrease  in bad  debt  expense.  Additionally,  included  in 1996  other operating expense was a nonrecurring $0.5 million payment to an anchor at one of the  centers.  Interest  expense  increased  $1.0  million  primarily  due to an increase  in debt used to finance  Arizona  Mills and the  Westfarms  expansion, partially  offset by a decrease in debt related to Fairlane.  Operating costs as presented in the preceding  table differ from the amounts shown in the combined, summarized  financial  statements of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures by the amount of intercompany profit.    As a result of the foregoing,  net income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures decreased by $1.9 million,  or 2.0%, to $92.4 million.  The Company's  equity in net  income of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  was $48.8  million,  a 0.4% increase from 1996.  Net Income - ----------    As a result of the foregoing,  the Company's income before  extraordinary item and minority interest increased by $10.4 million, or 13.7%, to $86.4 million for 1997. In 1996,  the Company  recognized a $1.3 million  extraordinary  charge related to the prepayment of Fairlane's  debt.  After payment of $4.1 million in Series A preferred  dividends,  net income  available to common  shareowners for 1997 was $24.6 million, compared to $20.3 million in 1996.                                             29      Liquidity and Capital Resources    On  September  30,  1998,  the  Company  obtained a majority  and  controlling interest in the  Operating  Partnership  as a result of the GMPT  Exchange  (see Results  of  Operations  --  GMPT  Exchange  and  Related  Transactions  above). Consequently,  the  Company  has  consolidated  the  accounts  of the  Operating Partnership  in the Company's  financial  statements for the year ended December 31,1998.  For prior  periods,  the Company  accounted for its  investment in the Operating  Partnership  under the equity  method.  In the following  discussion, references to beneficial interest represent the Operating Partnership's share of the results of its consolidated and unconsolidated  businesses. The Company does not have, and has not had, any parent company  indebtedness;  all debt discussed represents obligations of the Operating Partnership.    The  Company  believes  that its net cash  provided by  operating  activities, distributions  from the Joint  Ventures,  the  unutilized  portion of its credit facilities,  and its  ability  to access  the credit  markets,  assure  adequate liquidity  to  conduct  its  operations  in  accordance  with its  dividend  and financing policies.    As of December 31, 1998, the Company had a consolidated  cash balance of $19.0 million.  Additionally,  the Company has a $200 million line of credit. The line had no  borrowings  as of December 31, 1998 and expires in September  2001.  The Company  also has  available  an  unsecured  bank  line of  credit  of up to $40 million.  The line had $15.5  million of  borrowings as of December 31, 1998 and expires in August 1999.  Equity Transactions    In April 1998, the Company sold approximately two million shares of its common stock at $13.1875 per share,  before deducting the  underwriting  commission and expenses of the offering,  under the Company's shelf registration statement. The Company  used the  proceeds  to acquire an  additional  equity  interest  in the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership paid all costs of the offering. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds of approximately $25 million for general partnership purposes.    In October  1997,  the Company  issued eight  million  shares of 8.3% Series A Preferred  Stock under its equity shelf  registration  statement.  Dividends are payable  in  arrears on or before  the last day of each  calendar  quarter.  The Company  used the $200 million  proceeds to acquire a Series A Preferred  Equity interest in the Operating Partnership that entitles the Company to distributions (in the form of guaranteed  payments) in amounts equal to the dividends  payable on the Company's Series A Preferred  Stock.  The Operating  Partnership used the net proceeds to pay down floating rate debt.  Debt    In anticipation of the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating Partnership used the $1.2 billion  proceeds from two bridge loans bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.30% to extinguish  approximately $1.1 billion of debt, including substantially all of the  Operating  Partnership's  public  unsecured  debt,  its  outstanding commercial paper, and borrowings on its existing lines of credit.  The remaining proceeds were used primarily to pay prepayment premiums and transaction costs.    The balance of the first  bridge  loan of $902  million was assumed by GMPT at the time of the GMPT Exchange.  The second loan had a balance of $340 million at December 31, 1998 and expires in June 1999. The Company expects to refinance the balance on the bridge loan prior to the expiration date (see below).    Proceeds  from  other  borrowings  in 1998  were  used for the  $77.7  million redemption of 6.1 million units of partnership  interest in January 1998, and to fund capital  expenditures for the Consolidated  Businesses and contributions to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for construction costs.                                          30       At December 31, 1998,  the  Operating  Partnership's  debt and its  beneficial interest  in the debt of its  Consolidated  and  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures totaled $1,186.2  million.  As shown in the following  table,  $190.8 million of this debt was floating  rate debt that  remained  unhedged at December 31, 1998. Interest  rates shown do not include  amortization  of debt  issuance  costs and interest rate hedging costs. These items are reported as interest expense in the results  of  operations.  In the  aggregate,  these  costs  added  0.47%  to the effective rate of interest on beneficial  interest in debt at December 31, 1998. Included in  beneficial  interest in debt is debt used to fund  development  and expansion  costs.

Certain  loan  agreements  contain  various  restrictive  covenants  including limitations  on net worth,  minimum  debt  service  and fixed  charges  coverage ratios, a maximum payout ratio on distributions, and a minimum debt yield ratio, the latter being the most restrictive.  The Company is in compliance with all of such covenants.    In February  1999, an application  was completed for a secured,  ten-year $270 million financing with an all-in rate of approximately 6.9% on The Mall at Short Hills.  The  financing  is expected to close by the end of the first  quarter of 1999 and the proceeds will be used to pay down the bridge loan, which matures on June 21, 1999.  The bridge loan has a balance of $340 million and the Company is working on refinancing  the remaining  balance.  The Company expects to obtain a secured  financing  on  an  additional  center.  In  addition,   there  will  be availability  under existing  lines of credit to repay the remaining  balance if the additional financing is delayed past the end of the second quarter.  Sensitivity Analysis    The Company has  exposure to interest  rate risk on its debt  obligations  and interest  rate  instruments.  Based on the  Operating  Partnership's  beneficial interest  in debt and  interest  rates in effect at  December  31,  1998,  a one percent  increase in interest  rates would  decrease  earnings and cash flows by approximately  $5.2  million.  A one percent  decrease  in interest  rates would increase  earnings and cash flows by  approximately  $6.0 million.  Based on the Company's consolidated debt and interest rates in effect at December 31, 1998, a one percent  increase or decrease in interest  rates would  decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately $7 million.                                               31      Funds from Operations    A principal  factor that the Company  considers  in  determining  dividends to shareowners  is  Funds  from  Operations,  which is  defined  as  income  before extraordinary and unusual items, real estate depreciation and amortization,  and the  allocation  to the minority  interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  less preferred dividends.     Funds from  Operations  does not  represent  cash flows from  operations,  as defined  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,   and  should  not  be considered  to be an  alternative  to net income as an  indicator  of  operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. However, the National  Association of Real Estate  Investment  Trusts suggests that Funds from Operations is a useful  supplemental  measure of operating  performance for REITs.

(2) Includes $2.7  million  of  mall  tenant   allowance     amortization. (3) Includes $1.3 million of mall tenant allowance amortization.  Dividends    The  Company  pays  regular  quarterly  dividends  to its  common and Series A preferred shareowners. Dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash  available to the Company,  its financial condition,  capital and other requirements,  and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Preferred dividends on the Series A Stock accrue  regardless  of  whether  earnings,  cash  availability,  or  contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends.    On December 10, 1998, the Company  declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.24 per common share payable  January 20, 1999 to  shareowners of record on December 31, 1998. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.51875 per share on the Company's 8.3% Series A Preferred Stock,  paid December 31, 1998 to shareowners of record on December 21, 1998.                                                     32        Common  dividends  declared  totaled $0.945 per common share in 1998, of which $0.854  represented  return of capital and $0.091  represented  ordinary income, compared  to  dividends  declared in 1997 of $0.925 per common  share,  of which $0.324 represented return of capital and $0.601 represented ordinary income. The tax status of total 1999 common dividends declared and to be declared,  assuming continuation of a $0.24 per common share quarterly dividend,  is estimated to be approximately  50% return of capital,  and approximately 50% of ordinary income. Series A preferred  dividends  declared  were $2.075 and $0.50722 per  preferred share in 1998 and 1997, respectively,  all of which represented ordinary income. The tax status of total 1999 dividends to be paid on Series A Preferred Stock is estimated to be 100% ordinary income.  These are forward-looking  statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially, including:  1) the amount of  dividends  declared;  2) changes in the  Company's share of  anticipated  taxable  income of the Operating  Partnership  due to the actual  results of the  Operating  Partnership;  3) changes in the number of the Company's  outstanding  shares;  4) property  acquisitions or  dispositions;  5) financing  transactions,  including refinancing of existing debt; and 6) changes in the Internal Revenue Code or its application.    The  annual  determination  of the  Company's  common  dividends  is  based on anticipated Funds from Operations available after preferred  dividends,  as well as financing considerations and other appropriate factors.  Further, the Company has decided that the growth in common  dividends will be less than the growth in Funds from Operations for the immediate future.    Any inability of the  Operating  Partnership  or its Joint  Ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts,  capital  expenditures and changes in working capital, including development activities and expansions, may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such  obligations,  thereby possibly reducing distributions  to partners of the Operating  Partnership  and funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends.  Capital Spending    Capital spending for routine  maintenance of the shopping centers is generally recovered  from  tenants.   Capital  spending  not  recovered  from  tenants  is summarized in the following tables:                                                                             1998                                              ---------------------------------------------------------                                                                                 Beneficial Interest in                                                               Unconsolidated    Consolidated Businesses                                              Consolidated         Joint         and Unconsolidated                                              Businesses        Ventures (1)     Joint Ventures (1)(2)                                              ---------------------------------------------------------                                                              (in millions of dollars)         Development, renovation, and expansion:   Existing centers                              27.0             34.5                43.9   New centers                                  279.3              4.5               214.6 Pre-construction development activities,   net of charge to operations                   33.1                                 33.1 Mall tenant allowances                           8.2              7.4                12.3 Corporate office improvements and                3.4                                  3.4     equipment Other                                            0.3              2.2                 1.3                                                -----            -----               ----- Total                                          351.3             48.6               308.6                                                =====            =====               =====  (1)Costs are net of intercompany profits.

(2)Includes the Operating  Partnership's  share of construction  costs for Great    Lakes Crossing (an 80% owned consolidated joint venture) and MacArthur Center    (a 70% owned consolidated joint venture).     The Operating  Partnership's  share of mall tenant  allowances per square foot leased during the year,  excluding  expansion  space and new  developments,  was $10.86 ($11.80 excluding the transferred centers) in 1998, and $8.34 in 1997. In addition,  the Operating  Partnership's  share of  capitalized  leasing costs in 1998,  excluding new developments,  was $11.4 million,  or $8.96 per square foot leased  ($7.0  million,  or $7.95 per square  foot,  excluding  the  transferred centers),  and $10.9 million or $10.72 per square foot leased during the year in 1997.    MacArthur Center, a new center under construction in Norfolk, Virginia, opened in March 1999. The 930,000 thousand square foot center is anchored by Nordstrom  and Dillard's.  This Center is owned by a joint venture in which the Operating Partnership   has  a  70%   controlling   interest  and  is  projected  to  cost approximately $157 million.    International  Plaza, a new 1.3 million square foot center under  construction in Tampa, Florida, will be anchored by Nordstrom,  Lord & Taylor,  Dillard's and Neiman  Marcus.  This  center  will be owned  by a joint  venture  in which  the Operating  Partnership  will have a controlling  50.1%  interest.  In 1999,  the Company held ground-breaking ceremonies for The Shops at Willow Bend, a new 1.5  million square foot center in Plano, Texas.  Anchors will be Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth  Avenue,  Lord & Taylor,  Foley's and  Dillard's.  The Mall at  Wellington Green,  a 1.3 million square foot center under  construction  in West Palm Beach County,  Florida, will be anchored by Lord & Taylor, Burdine's, Dillard's and JCPenney.  The center  will be owned by a joint  venture in which the  Operating Partnership  has a 90%  controlling  interest.  All three of these  centers  are expected  to open in 2001  and  will  have an  aggregate  cost to the  Operating Partnership of over $500 million.    In 1996, the Operating Partnership entered into an agreement to lease Memorial City Mall, a 1.4 million square foot shopping center located in Houston,  Texas. Memorial City is anchored by Sears,  Foley's,  Montgomery Ward and Mervyn's.  In November 1999, the Operating  Partnership  has the option to terminate the lease by paying $2 million to the  lessor.  The  Operating  Partnership  is using this option period to evaluate the redevelopment  opportunities of the center.  Under the terms of the lease, the Operating Partnership has agreed to invest a minimum of $3  million  during  the  three  year  option  period.  If the  redevelopment proceeds,  the Operating  Partnership  is required to invest an  additional  $22 million in property  expenditures  not recoverable from tenants during the first 10 years of the lease term.    The Operating Partnership and The Mills Corporation have formed an alliance to develop  value  super-regional  projects  in  major  metropolitan  markets.  The ten-year  agreement  calls for the two  companies to jointly  develop and own at least seven of these centers,  each representing  approximately  $200 million of capital  investment.  A number of  locations  across the nation are targeted for future initiatives.                                          34        The  following  table  summarizes  planned  capital  spending,  which  is  not recovered from tenants and assumes no acquisitions during 1999:                                                                         1999                                          -------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                 Beneficial Interest in                                                               Unconsolidated    Consolidated Businesses                                             Consolidated         Joint          and Unconsolidated                                             Businesses          Ventures (1)    Joint Ventures (1)(2)                                          -------------------------------------------------------------                                                             (in millions of dollars)        Development, renovation, and expansion       223.4(3)            25.4               190.0 Mall tenant allowances                         6.1                9.8                11.1 Pre-construction development and other        21.5                4.0                23.5                                              -----               ----               ----- Total                                        251.0               39.2               224.6                                              =====               ====               =====  (1)Costs are net of intercompany profits. (2)Includes the Operating  Partnership's  share of construction  costs for Great    Lakes Crossing (an 80% owned consolidated joint venture), MacArthur Center (a    70% owned  consolidated  joint venture),  The Mall at Wellington Green (a 90%    owned  consolidated joint venture),  and International  Plaza ( a 50.1% owned    consolidated joint venture). (3)Includes costs related to MacArthur Center,  Great Lakes Crossing,  The Shops    at Willow Bend, The Mall at Wellington Green and International Plaza.      The Operating Partnership's share of costs for development projects scheduled to be  completed in 2001 is  anticipated  to be as much as $185 million and $165 million in 2000 and 2001,  respectively.  Estimates of future  capital  spending include  only  projects  approved  by the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  and, consequently,  estimates  will change as new  projects are  approved.  Estimates regarding capital  expenditures  presented above are forward-looking  statements and  certain  significant  factors  could  cause the  actual  results  to differ materially, including but not limited to: 1) actual results of negotiations with anchors,  tenants  and  contractors;  2)  changes  in the  scope  and  number of projects;   3)  cost  overruns;   4)  timing  of   expenditures;   5)  financing considerations; and 6) actual time to complete projects.     The Company  expects to fund the  development  of new centers  primarily with proceeds  from  construction  facilities.  Other  potential  sources  of capital include equity  offerings,  joint venture partner  contributions  and borrowings under other credit facilities.  Year 2000 Matters     The approach of the calendar year 2000 (Year 2000)  presents  issues for many financial,  information, and operational systems that may not properly recognize the Year 2000.  The Company has  developed a detailed  plan to address the risks posed by the Year 2000 issue,  covering affected  application and infrastructure systems.  Affected  systems include both  informational  (such as accounting and payroll)  and  operational  (such as  elevators,  security  and  lighting).  The Company's plan also addresses the effect of third parties with which it conducts business,  including tenants, vendors,  contractors,  creditors, and others. The Company has completed the assessment,  inventory and planning phases of its plan and has determined that the majority of the Company's  internal  systems and all of its mission critical systems are already Year 2000 compliant. The Company has requested information and has obtained commitments from its national tenants and the majority of its critical vendors and suppliers, and is continuing to develop alternative solutions to minimize the impact on the Company in the event they do not meet their Year 2000 commitments.     The Company  expects to  remediate  any  remaining  issues  encountered  with application and infrastructure  systems through repair and/or  replacement,  and plans  to  perform  a full  system  test by the end of the  first  quarter.  The estimated  costs of addressing the Year 2000 issue were not material to 1998 and are not  expected  to be  material to 1999  operations.  The  Company  will also continue  monitoring the progress of material  third  parties'  responses to the Year 2000 issue.  The Company believes that its most likely exposure will be the failure of third parties in  comprehensively  addressing the issue. For example, failure of utility companies to meet their commitments might result in temporary business   interruption  at  centers.  The  Company  is  continuing  to  develop contingency plans in response to such exposure, as appropriate. Failure of third parties with which the Company conducts business to respond successfully to the Year 2000 issue may have a material adverse effect on the Company.                                          35      Cash Tender Agreement    A.  Alfred  Taubman  has the annual  right to tender to the  Company  units of partnership interest in the Operating  Partnership  (provided that the aggregate value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender Agreement).  At A. Alfred Taubman's  election,  his family, and Robert C. Larson and his family may  participate in tenders.  The Company will have the option to pay for  these  interests  from  available  cash,  borrowed  funds,  or from the proceeds of an offering of the Company's  common stock.  Generally,  the Company expects to finance these purchases  through the sale of new shares of its stock. The  tendering  partner will bear all market risk if the market price at closing is less than the purchase price and will bear the costs of sale. Any proceeds of the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of the Company.    Based on a market value at December 31, 1998 of $13.75 per common  share,  the aggregate value of interests in the Operating  Partnership  that may be tendered under the Cash Tender Agreement was approximately $332 million.  The purchase of these  interests at December 31, 1998 would have resulted in the Company  owning an additional 29% interest in the Operating Partnership.  New Accounting Pronouncements    In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities." This Statement requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the balance  sheet as assets and liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivatives and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. This Statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's  consolidated  financial statements.  This Statement is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 1999.                                        36      Item 7A.
