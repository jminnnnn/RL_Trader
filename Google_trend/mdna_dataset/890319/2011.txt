Item 7 . MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.    The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains various “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including the following: statements regarding future developments and joint ventures, rents, returns, and earnings; statements regarding the continuation of trends; and any statements regarding the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash generated from operating, investing, and financing activities for our future liquidity and capital resource needs. We caution that although forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs and reasonable judgment based upon current information, these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, because of risks, uncertainties, and factors including, but not limited to, the continuing impacts of the recent U.S. recession and global credit environment, other changes in general economic and real estate conditions, changes in the interest rate environment and the availability of financing, and adverse changes in the retail industry. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. Other risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed with the SEC, and in particular those set forth under “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Taubman Centers, Inc. and the notes thereto.    General Background and Performance Measurement    Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO) is a Michigan corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT). The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership or TRG) is a majority-owned partnership subsidiary of TCO, which owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us", and "our" refer to TCO, the Operating Partnership, and/or the Operating Partnership's subsidiaries as the context may require. We own, manage, lease, acquire, dispose of, develop, and expand regional and super-regional shopping centers. The Consolidated Businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreements, The Taubman Company LLC (Manager), and Taubman Properties Asia LLC and its subsidiaries (Taubman Asia). Shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.    References in this discussion to “beneficial interest” refer to our ownership or pro-rata share of the item being discussed. Also, the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their performance as a whole, without regard to our ownership interest. Consequently, in addition to the discussion of the operations of the Consolidated Businesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented and discussed as a whole. All operating statistics provided exclude The Pier Shops. In addition, 2010 and 2009 statistics also exclude Regency Square. See “Results of Operations – The Pier Shops at Caesars,” and “Results of Operations – Regency Square.”    Overall Summary of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Our primary source of revenue is from the leasing of space in our shopping centers. Generally these leases are long term, with our average lease term of new leases at approximately seven years during 2010 and approximately six years during 2009, excluding temporary leases. Therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants’ sales and consequently their ability to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability to find new tenants for our shopping centers.    We have begun to see positive signs of stabilization in the economy and capital markets although the impacts of the recent recession continue. During 2010, only 0.7% of tenants sought the protection of the bankruptcy laws, compared to 3.9% and 2.5% of tenants in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We believe this is indicative of the improved health of retailers as well as the proactive way landlords worked with retailers in trouble last year so that they could stay open, effectively helping them restructure outside of bankruptcy. The retail environment has shown improvement and retailers are becoming more optimistic with their expansion plans and capital allocation decisions. However, retailers are still sensitive to occupancy costs and negotiations continue to be challenging.           27            Our mall tenant sales per square foot statistics have shown strong improvement in 2010. Tenant sales per square foot were $564 in 2010, a 12.4% increase from 2009, and higher than we have ever reported. We are expecting tenant sales per square foot to be up 3% to 4% in 2011. See "Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues."    Ending occupancy was 90.1% at December 31, 2010, up 0.3% from 2009. We anticipate year end occupancy will be up about 1% in 2011 but may see a modest decrease early in the year. Rent per square foot increased 0.7% for the fourth quarter of 2010 and was down 0.7% for the year. We expect that average rents per square foot in 2011 will be up in comparison to 2010 by approximately 3%. The rents we are able to achieve are affected by economic trends and tenants’ expectations thereof, as described under “Rental Rates and Occupancy.” The spread between rents on openings and closings may not be indicative of future periods, as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces, and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount, location, and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period. Mall tenant sales, occupancy levels, and our resulting revenues are seasonal in nature (see “Seasonality").    Our analysis of our financial results begins under “Results of Operations.”    In September 2010, our Board of Directors made the decision to discontinue financial support of Regency Square. In 2009, we also discontinued financial support of The Pier Shops and the loan on this property is in default. Impairment charges were recognized on Regency Square and The Pier Shops in 2009. See “Results of Operations – Regency Square” and “Results of Operations – The Pier Shop at Caesars” for further discussion and the status of the Regency Square and Pier Shops’ loans. In 2008, we also recorded impairment charges related to our Oyster Bay project and our Sarasota project. See “Results of Operations – Oyster Bay” and “Results of Operations – Sarasota.”    We have begun to see signs of an economic recovery and have seen some improvement in our center operations in 2010. See “Results of Operations – Center Operations."    We have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues, recoveries from tenants, and revenue from management, leasing, and development services. We disclose our share of these sources of income under “Results of Operations – Other Income.”    We have been very active in managing our balance sheet, completing refinancings of MacArthur Center, Arizona Mills, and The Mall at Partridge Creek in 2010 as outlined under “Results of Operations – Debt Transactions.”    We also describe the current status of our efforts to broaden our growth in Asia.  See “Results of Operations – Taubman Asia”.    With all the preceding information as background, we then provide insight and explanations for variances in our financial results for 2010, 2009, and 2008 under “Comparison of 2010 to 2009” and “Comparison of 2009 to 2008.” As information useful to understanding our results, we have described the reasons for our use of non-GAAP measures such as Beneficial Interests in EBITDA and Funds from Operations (FFO) under “Results of Operations – Use of Non-GAAP Measures.” Reconciliations from net income (loss) and net income (loss) allocable to common shareowners to these measures follow the annual comparisons.    We then provide a discussion of our critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements that will affect periods subsequent to 2010.    Our discussion of sources and uses of capital resources under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” begins with a brief overview of current market conditions and our financial position as of December 31, 2010. In January 2011, the International Plaza loan matured and was extended, and two additional loans mature in 2011. The $250 million Fair Oaks loan, $125 million at our share, matures in April 2011. The $72.7 million Regency Square loan matures in November 2011 but we have notified the lender of our intent not to continue support of the center including not repaying the loan. In February 2011, our $550 million line of credit was extended to February 2012. Our $40 million line was extended in December 2010 to February 2012. We then discuss our capital activities and transactions that occurred in 2010. Analysis of specific operating, investing, and financing activities is then provided in more detail.           28            Specific analysis of our fixed and floating rates and periods of interest rate risk exposure is provided under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Beneficial Interest in Debt.” Completing our analysis of our exposure to rates are the effects of changes in interest rates on our cash flows and fair values of debt contained under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sensitivity Analysis.” Also see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Loan Commitments and Guarantees” for discussion of compliance with debt covenants.    In conducting our business, we enter into various contractual obligations, including those for debt, capital leases for property improvements, operating leases for land and office space, purchase obligations, and other long-term commitments. Detail of these obligations, including expected settlement periods, is contained under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Contractual Obligations.” Property-level debt represents the largest single class of obligations. Described under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Loan Commitments and Guarantees” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Tender Agreement” are our significant guarantees and commitments.    Renovation and expansion of existing malls has been a significant use of our capital in recent years, as described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending – Planned Capital Spending.” Our City Creek Center project, which we will own under a participating lease, is expected to open in March 2012 at which time a $75 million payment will be made to the lessor. We expect capital spending in 2011 to consist primarily of tenant allowances, renovations and expansions at our operating centers, including projects at Short Hills and Willow Bend. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we formed a joint venture to seek development sites for outlet shopping centers.    Dividends and distributions are also significant uses of our capital resources. The factors considered when determining the amount of our dividends, including requirements arising because of our status as a REIT, are described under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Dividends.”    Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues    Our mall tenant sales per square foot statistics have shown improvement since July 2009 and in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased by 12.9% compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. For all of 2010, our tenant sales increased 12.4% to a record level of $564 per square foot.    Over the long term, the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately 90% of these revenues and mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent, percentage rent, and recoverable expenses (together, total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However, levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs, and may be impacted significantly, either positively or negatively, by the success or lack of success of a small number of tenants or even a single tenant.    We believe that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot.    Sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay. The effects of increases or declines in sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents that percentage rents represent of total rents (approximately 4% in 2010).    While tenant sales are critical over the long term, the high quality regional mall business has been a very stable business model with its diversity of income from thousands of tenants, its staggered lease maturities, and high proportion of fixed rent. However, a sustained trend in sales does impact, either negatively or positively, our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates.           29            The following table summarizes occupancy costs, excluding utilities, for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales:                                        2010                                      2009                                      2008          Mall tenant sales (in thousands)    $  4,619,896        $  4,185,996        $  4,536,500        Sales per square foot       564           502           533                                              Consolidated Businesses:                                        Minimum rents       9.1  %        10.2  %        9.7  %     Percentage rents       0.4           0.3           0.4        Expense recoveries       5. 0           5.7           5.3        Mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales       14.5  %        16.2  %        15.4  %     Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:                                        Minimum rents       8.6  %        9.6  %        8.9  %     Percentage rents       0.4           0.3           0.4        Expense recoveries       4.5           5.0           4.6        Mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales       13.5  %        14.9  %        13.9  %     Combined:                                        Minimum rents       9.0  %        9.9  %        9.4  %     Percentage rents       0.4           0.3           0.4        Expense recoveries       4.7           5.6           5.1        Mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales       14.1  %        15.8  %        14.9  %      In 2009, mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales increased due primarily to the decrease in tenant sales. In 2010, the statistic decreased primarily due to the increase in tenant sales.    Rental Rates and Occupancy    As leases have expired in the centers, we have generally been able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. Generally, center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases. In periods of increasing sales as we are experiencing now, rents on new leases will generally tend to rise. In periods of slower growth or declining sales, rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason, as tenants' expectations of future growth become less optimistic. Average rent per square foot in 2011 is expected to be up about 3%. Rent per square foot information for centers in our Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures follows:           30                    2010          2009          2008        Average rent per square foot:                             Consolidated Businesses   $  43.63        $  43.69        $  43.95       Unconsolidated Joint Ventures      43.73           44.49           44.61       Combined      43.66           43.95           44.15       Opening base rent per square foot:                                      Consolidated Businesses   $  50.69        $  46.69        $  54.78       Unconsolidated Joint Ventures      47.16           51.10           59.36       Combined      49.69           47.82           56.46       Square feet of GLA opened:                                      Consolidated Businesses      577,435           637,900           589,730       Unconsolidated Joint Ventures      228,075           218,953           340,275       Combined      805,510           856,853           930,005       Closing base rent per square foot:                                      Consolidated Businesses   $  46.27        $  42.75        $  49.60       Unconsolidated Joint Ventures      47.20           48.64           48.72       Combined      46.52           44.25           49.30       Square feet of GLA closed:                                      Consolidated Businesses      647,982           761,726           650,607       Unconsolidated Joint Ventures      243,093           259,457           342,698       Combined      891,075           1,021,183           993,305       Releasing spread per square foot:                                      Consolidated Businesses   $  4.42        $  3.94        $  5.18       Unconsolidated Joint Ventures      (0.04  )        2.46           10.64       Combined      3.17           3.57           7.16         The spread between opening and closing rents may not be indicative of future periods, as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces, and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount, location, and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period.    Mall tenant leased space, ending occupancy, and average occupancy rates are as follows:                                     2010                                   2009                                  2008          Ending occupancy       90.1  %        89.8   %        90.5  %     Average occupancy       88.8           89.4           90.5        Leased space       92.0           91.6           92.0         Ending occupancy was 90.1%, a 0.3% increase from 89.8% in 2009. At 92.0%, leased space is 0.9% over the year end occupancy level. We expect occupancy in 2011 to end the year up about 1% but we may see a modest decrease early in the year. Temporary tenant leasing continues to be strong and ended the year at about 5.0% compared to 4.1% in 2009. Temporary tenants, defined as those with lease terms less than or equal to a year, are not included in occupancy or leased space statistics. Tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases was 0.7% in 2010, compared to 3.9% in 2009, and 2.5% in 2008.           31            Seasonality    The regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant, sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and back-to-school period. While minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors, most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter, and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Additionally, most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter. Gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation income may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.               Total  2010          4 th  Quarter  2010          3 rd  Quarter  2010          2 nd  Quarter  2010          1 st  Quarter  2010               (in thousands, except occupancy and leased space data)        Mall tenant sales  (1)      $  4,619,896        $  1,487,634        $  1,085,195        $  1,052,274        $  994,793       Revenues and gains on land sales  and other nonoperating income:                                                                 Consolidated Businesses         657,360           195,036           155,454           155,232           151,638       Unconsolidated Joint Ventures         270,393           77,553           67,777           63,711           63,352       Occupancy and leased space:                                                                 Ending occupancy           90.1  %          90.1  %          88.6  %          88.0  %         88.2  %    Average occupancy           88.8           89.9           88.4           88.2           88.5       Leased space           92.0           92.0           91.8           90.9           91.3             (1)      Based on reports of sales furnished by mall tenants.       Because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries, mall tenant occupancy costs (the sum of minimum rents, percentage rents, and expense recoveries) as a percentage of sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter.            Total  2010          4 th  Quarter  2010          3 rd  Quarter  2010          2 nd  Quarter  2010          1 st  Quarter  2010        Consolidated Businesses:                                               Minimum rents   9.1  %     7.3  %     9.6  %     9.8  %     10.6  %    Percentage rents   0.4        0.6        0.3        0.1        0.3       Expense recoveries   5.0        5.2        4.7        5.1        5.0       Mall tenant occupancy costs   14.5  %     13.1  %     14.6  %     15.0  %     15.9  %    Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:                                               Minimum rents   8.6  %     6.8  %     9.2  %     9.5  %     9.7  %    Percentage rents   0.4        0.6        0.3        0.1        0.3       Expense recoveries   4.5        4.3        4.6        4.5        4.5       Mall tenant occupancy costs   13.5  %     11.7  %     14.1  %     14.1  %     14.5  %    Combined:                                               Minimum rents   9.0  %     7.2  %     9.4  %     9.7  %     10.3  %    Percentage rents   0.4        0.6        0.3        0.1        0.3       Expense recoveries   4.7        4.8        4.7        4.9        4.8       Mall tenant occupancy costs   14.1  %     12.6  %     14.4  %     14.7  %     15.4  %                 32            Results of Operations    In addition to the results and trends in our operations discussed in the preceding sections, the following sections discuss certain transactions that affected operations in the years ending 2010, 2009, and 2008, or are expected to affect operations in the future.    Regency Square    In September 2009, we concluded that the book value of the investment in Regency Square was impaired and as a result, the book value of the property was written down by $59.0 million to a fair value of approximately $29 million as of September 30, 2009. The decision was based on estimates of future cash flows for the property, which were negatively impacted by necessary capital expenditures and declining net operating income (NOI). In September 2010, our Board of Directors made the decision to discontinue financial support of Regency Square including not funding the non-recourse mortgage debt that is due in November 2011. As a result, we have begun discussions with the lender about the center’s future ownership. We expect the non-cash impact of owning Regency Square (assuming default interest begins April 2011) to result in an earnings charge in 2011 of approximately $(5.6) million. The impact excluding depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $(3.6) million. In addition, a significant non-cash accounting gain, representing the difference between the book value of the debt, interest payable and other obligations extinguished over the net book value of the property and any other assets transferred, will be recognized when the loan obligation is extinguished upon transfer of title of Regency Square. The process is not in our control and the timing of transfer of title is uncertain. The book value of the investment in Regency Square as of December 31, 2010 was approximately $30 million, which includes additional capital spending that was anticipated in determining the fair value in 2009.    The Pier Shops at Caesars    In September 2009, the book value of The Pier Shops was written down by $107.7 million (of which, our share was $101.8 million) to a fair value of approximately $52 million. Our decision was based on the conclusion of our Board of Directors to discontinue financial support of The Pier Shops given long-term prospects for the property, including that cash flows generated from the center were insufficient to cover debt service on the $135 million non-recourse loan. As a result of our discontinuing payment of debt service, the loan is now in default. Under the terms of the loan agreement, interest accrues at the original stated rate of 6.01% plus a 4% default rate. Accrued interest and late fees total $16.0 million as of December 31, 2010. Including the impact of compounding default interest and late fees, the effective rate on the $135 million loan balance is 11.33% and 10.93%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2010. Although we are no longer funding any cash shortfalls, we continue to record the operations of the center and interest on the loan in our results until title for the center has been transferred and our obligation for the loan is extinguished. In April 2010, the holder of the loan on The Pier Shops filed a lawsuit to foreclose on the loan. The foreclosure process is not in our control and the timing of transfer of title is uncertain. We expect the non-cash impact of owning The Pier Shops (including default interest) to result in an earnings charge in 2011 of approximately $(22.9) million. The impact excluding depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $(16.5) million. These earnings impacts represent 100% of the results of The Pier Shops. In addition, a significant non-cash accounting gain, representing the difference between the book value of the debt, interest payable and other obligations extinguished over the net book value of the property and any other assets transferred, will be recognized when the loan obligation is extinguished upon transfer of title of The Pier Shops. The book value of the investment in The Pier Shops as of December 31, 2010 was approximately $44 million.    Oyster Bay    In 2008, we recognized an impairment charge to income of $117.9 million for the Oyster Bay project, including $4.6 million in costs, which were paid in 2009, associated with obligations under existing contracts related to the project. This determination was reached after an overall assessment of the probability of the development of the mall as designed as a result of the delay in obtaining a special use permit. The charge included the costs of previous development activities as well as holding and other costs that management believes will likely not benefit the development if and when we obtain the rights to build the center. We have been expensing costs relating to Oyster Bay since the fourth quarter of 2008 and will continue to do so until it is probable that we will be able to successfully move forward with a project. Our remaining capitalized investment in the project as of December 31, 2010 is $39.8 million, which is classified in “development pre-construction costs” (see “Note 3 – Properties – Oyster Bay” to our consolidated financial statements) and consists of land and site improvements. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining the right to build the center, it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the full amount of this capitalized investment through alternate uses of the land.           33            Sarasota    In 2008, we recognized an $8.3 million charge to income relating to a project in Sarasota, Florida. The charge to income represented our share of total project costs. We have no asset remaining and continue to expense any additional costs related to the monitoring of the project. See “Note 4 – Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures – University Town Center” to our consolidated financial statements.    Litigation Charges    In 2009, we recognized litigation charges relating to the settlement of two lawsuits related to Westfarms, our center in West Hartford, Connecticut. The settlements included $34 million settled in December 2009 and $4.5 million settled in January 2010, of which our share of the total settlements was $30.4 million. See “Note 4 – Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Westfarms” to our consolidated financial statements.    Restructuring    In 2009, in response to the decreased level of active projects due to the downturn in the economy, we reduced our workforce by about 40 positions, primarily in areas that directly or indirectly affect our development initiatives in the U.S. and Asia. The restructuring charge was $2.5 million, and primarily represents the cost of terminations of personnel.    Center Operations    We saw improvement in the NOI of our centers in the fourth quarter of 2010, and ended the year up 0.5% over 2009, excluding lease cancellation income. We expect that NOI of our centers, excluding lease cancellation income, will be up in the range of 1% to 2% in 2011. We expect increased tenant rents resulting from higher average rent per square foot and improved occupancy. We expect net recoveries to be modestly down however because of increases in utility costs, lower CAM capital recoveries, and increased other expenses. See “Results of Operations – Use of Non-GAAP Measures” for the definition and discussion of NOI and see “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to NOI.”    Other Income    We have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues, recoveries from tenants, and revenues from management, leasing, and development services, as summarized in the following table. Lease cancellation revenue is primarily dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and can vary significantly. Gains on peripheral land sales can also vary significantly from year-to-year, depending on the results of negotiations with potential purchasers of land, as well as the economy and the timing of the transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized our approximately $22.4 million share of lease cancellation revenue. Our largest collections occurred in the fourth quarter when we recorded the income from the closure of the Saks Fifth Avenue store at Willow Bend. However, we do not expect this pace to continue, which could negatively impact our results in 2011. Excluding two large payments in 2010, our share of lease cancellation income would have been about $6 million. Our share of lease cancellation income over the last six years ranged from $8 million to this year’s $22.4 million.  In 2011, we are estimating our share of lease cancellation income to be about $6 million to $8 million.               2010          2009          2008               Consolidated  Businesses          Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures          Consolidated  Businesses          Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures          Consolidated  Businesses          Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures               (Operating Partnership’s share in millions)        Other income:                                                           Shopping center related revenues      $  22.2        $  2.8        $  22.5        $  2.7        $  26.9        $  3.0       Lease cancellation revenue         21.2           1.2           18.7           1.8           9.7           2.5             $  43.4        $  4.1        $  41.2        $  4.5        $  36.6        $  5.5       Gains on land sales and other  nonoperating income:                                                                             Gains on sales of peripheral land      $  2.2                                            $  2.8                   Interest income         0.5                    $  0.6                       1.5        $  0.4             $  2.8                    $  0.6                    $  4.3        $  0.4             (1)      Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.                34            Debt Transactions    We completed a series of debt financings in the three-year period ending December 31, 2010 as follows:               Date    Initial Loan  Balance          Stated  Interest Rate          Maturity Date  (1)           (in millions)                    MacArthur Center    September 2010           $131         LIBOR + 2.35%  (2)       September 2020     Arizona Mills    July 2010   175        5.76%      July 2020     The Mall at Partridge Creek    June 2010     83        6.15%      July 2020     Fair Oaks    April 2008   250         LIBOR+1.40%  (3)       April 2011     International Plaza    January 2008   325         LIBOR+1.15%  (4)       January 2011           (1)      Excludes any options to extend the maturities (see the footnotes to our financial statements regarding extension options).

(4)      The loan had been swapped at 5.01% for the initial three-year term of the loan agreement. In January 2011 the loan maturity was extended. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”       Borrowings under TRG’s revolving credit facility are primary obligations of the entities owning Dolphin, Fairlane, and Twelve Oaks, which are collateral for the line of credit. The Operating Partnership and the entities owning Fairlane and Twelve Oaks are guarantors under the credit agreement.    Taubman Asia    In October 2010 we appointed a new President of Taubman Asia.  He will be responsible for Taubman’s operations and future expansion in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on China and South Korea.      In September 2010, we entered into agreements to provide development, leasing and management services for IFC Mall in Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea. Currently under construction, the approximate 430,000 square foot mall will feature up to 100 stores and restaurants.    In 2008, Taubman Asia entered into agreements to acquire a 25% interest in The Mall at Studio City, the retail component of Macao Studio City, a major mixed-use project on the Cotai Strip in Macao, China. In August 2009, our Macao agreements terminated and our $54 million initial cash payment was returned to us because the financing for the project was not completed. In the fourth quarter of 2009 we recognized approximately $7 million of development fees collected for services performed primarily prior to 2009 on the Macao project.    Presentation of Operating Results    The following table contains the operating results of our Consolidated Businesses and the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. On January 1, 2009, we adopted the new accounting for noncontrolling interests. See “Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Noncontrolling Interests,” to our consolidated financial statements. Our average ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership was 67% in 2010, 2009 and 2008.    Use of Non-GAAP Measures    We use NOI as an alternative measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers, both on individual and stabilized portfolio bases. We define NOI as property-level operating revenues (includes rental income excluding straightline adjustments of minimum rent) less maintenance, taxes, utilities, ground rent (including straightline adjustments), and other property operating expenses. Since NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, pre-development charges, interest income and expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, restructuring charges, and gains from land and property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared period over period, reflects the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and operating rental properties, as well as the impact on their operations from trends in tenant sales, occupancy and rental rates, and operating costs. We also use NOI excluding lease cancellation income as an alternative measure because this income may vary significantly from period to period, which can affect comparability and trend analysis. We generally provide separate projections for expected NOI growth and our lease cancellation income.           35            The operating results in the following table include the supplemental earnings measures of Beneficial Interest in EBITDA and Funds from Operations (FFO). Beneficial Interest in EBITDA represents our share of the earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. We believe Beneficial Interest in EBITDA provides a useful indicator of operating performance, as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure.    The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of REITs.    We primarily use FFO in measuring operating performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation. We may also present adjusted versions of NOI, Beneficial Interest in EBITDA, and FFO when used by management to evaluate our operating performance when certain significant items have impacted our results that affect comparability with prior or future periods due to the nature or amounts of these items. In 2009, FFO was adjusted for impairment charges, a restructuring charge, and litigation charges. In 2008, FFO was adjusted for impairment charges. FFO was not adjusted in 2010.    Our presentations of NOI, Beneficial Interest in EBITDA, FFO, and adjusted versions of these measures, are not necessarily comparable to the similarly titled measures of other REITs due to the fact that not all REITs use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or as an indicator of our operating performance. Additionally, these measures do not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by GAAP. Reconciliations of Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Taubman Centers, Inc. Common Shareowners to Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations, Net Income (Loss) to Beneficial Interest in EBITDA, and Net Income (Loss) to Net Operating Income (Loss) are presented following “New Accounting Pronouncements.”           36          Comparison of 2010 to 2009    The following table sets forth operating results for 2010 and 2009, showing the results of the Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:               2010          2009               CONSOLIDATED    BUSINESSES          UNCONSOLIDATED  JOINT VENTURES  AT 100% (1)          CONSOLIDATED    BUSINESSES          UNCONSOLIDATED  JOINT VENTURES  AT 100% (1)               (in millions)        REVENUES:                                         Minimum rents      $  341.7        $  155.4        $  341.9        $  157.1       Percentage rents         13.2           6.6           10.8           5.1       Expense recoveries         237.4           100.6           246.4           101.7       Management, leasing, and development services         16.1                       21.2                   Other         46.1           7.8           45.8           8.7       Total revenues      $  654.6        $  270.4        $  666.1        $  272.5                                                            EXPENSES:                                                     Maintenance, taxes, and utilities      $  179.2        $  68.3        $  189.1        $  68.1       Other operating         75.4           19.4           67.2           24.0       Management, leasing, and development services         8.3                       7.9                   General and administrative         30.2                       27.9                   Litigation charges                                             38.5       Impairment charges                                 166.7                   Restructuring charge                                 2.5                   Interest expense         152.7           63.8           145.7           64.4       Depreciation and amortization  (2)         153.9           38.2           147.3           39.3       Total expenses      $  599.7        $  189.7        $  754.1        $  234.3                                                            Nonoperating income         2.8                       0.7           0.1       Impairment loss on marketable securities                                 (1.7  )                                  $  80.7                    $  38. 3       Income (loss) before income tax expense and equity in  income of   Unconsolidated Joint Ventures      $  57.6                    $  (89.0  )                Income tax expense         (0.7  )                    (1.7  )                Equity in income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  (2)         45.4                       11.5                   Net income (loss)      $  102.3                    $  (79.2  )                Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling  interests:                                                     Noncontrolling share of income of consolidated  joint ventures         (9.8  )                    (3.1  )                TRG Series F preferred distributions         (2.5  )                    (2.5  )                Noncontrolling share of (income) loss of TRG         (26.2  )                    31.2                   Distributions to participating securities of TRG         (1.6  )                    (1.6  )                Preferred stock dividends         (14.6  )                    (14.6  )                Net income (loss) attributable to Taubman Centers, Inc.  common shareowners      $  47.6                    $  (69.7  )                                                                     SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  (3) :                                                     EBITDA - 100%      $  364.2        $  182.7        $  204.0        $  142.0       EBITDA - outside partners' share         (41.5  )        (82.1  )        (35.3  )        (74.2  )    Beneficial interest in EBITDA      $  322.7        $  100.7        $  168.7        $  67.8       Beneficial interest expense         (131.5  )        (33.1  )        (125.8  )        (33.4  )    Beneficial income tax expense         (0.7  )                    (1.7  )                Non-real estate depreciation         (3.7  )                    (3.4  )                Preferred dividends and distributions         (17.1  )                    (17.1  )                Funds from Operations contribution      $  169.7        $  67.6        $  20.6        $  34.4             (1)      With the exception of the Supplemental Information, amounts include 100% of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Amounts are net of intercompany transactions. The Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented at 100% in order to allow for measurement of their performance as a whole, without regard to our ownership interest. In our consolidated financial statements, we account for investments in the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures under the equity method.         (2)      Amortization of our additional basis in the Operating Partnership included in depreciation and amortization was $4.9 million in both 2010 and 2009. Also, amortization of our additional basis included in equity in income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $1.9 million in both 2010 and 2009.         (3)      See “Results of Operations– Use of Non-GAAP Measures” for the definition and discussion of EBITDA and FFO.         (4)      Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.              37          Consolidated Businesses    Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $654.6 million, an $11.5 million or 1.7% decrease over 2009. Percentage rents increased due to higher tenant sales. Expense recoveries decreased primarily due to lower recoverable expenses. Management, leasing, and development revenue was unusually high in 2009 due to the collection of development fees on the Macao project.    Total expenses were $599.7 million, a $154.4 million or 20.5% decrease from 2009 primarily due to impairment charges of $166.7 million on The Pier Shops and Regency Square recognized in 2009 (see “Results of Operations – The Pier Shops at Caesars” and “Results of Operations – Regency Square”). Maintenance, taxes and utilities expense decreased primarily due to intensive management actions to reduce maintenance and electricity costs. Other operating expense increased due to increases in pre-development costs, center-related property management costs, and bad debt expense. Pre-development expense in 2009 was lower partially due to reimbursements for work performed in prior periods. In 2010, we incurred $16 million on pre-development activities and we expect our 2011 expense to be comparable. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to an increase in bonus expense. In 2009, we recognized a $2.5 million restructuring charge (see “Results of Operations – Restructuring”). Interest expense increased primarily due to the default interest rate charged on The Pier Shops loan in 2010 and the refinancing of Partridge Creek at a higher interest rate, partially offset by the refinancing of MacArthur at a lower interest rate. Depreciation expense increased due to changes in depreciable lives of tenant allowances in connection with early terminations.    Nonoperating income increased by $2.1 million in 2010. There were $2.2 million of gains on land sales in 2010, compared to none in 2009. We are not projecting any land sale transactions to occur in 2011.    Income tax expense decreased due to state tax expense and foreign income tax on the Macau revenue recognized in 2009.    Unconsolidated Joint Ventures    Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $270.4 million, a $2.1 million or 0.8% decrease from 2009. Minimum rents decreased primarily due to decreases in rent per square foot. Percentage rents increased primarily due to higher tenant sales. Expense recoveries decreased primarily due to decreased marketing and promotion revenue.    Total expenses decreased by $44.6 million or 19.0%, to $189.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to litigation charges of $38.5 million recognized in 2009 (see “Results of Operations – Litigation Charges”). Other operating expense decreased primarily due to reductions in professional fees and marketing and promotional expense. Depreciation expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in depreciation on CAM assets.    As a result of the foregoing, income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures increased by $42.4 million to $80.7 million. Our equity in income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $45.4 million, a $33.9 million increase from 2009.    Net Income (Loss)    Net income increased by $181.5 million to $102.3 million, primarily due to the impairment charges and the litigation charges in 2009. After allocation of income to noncontrolling and preferred interests, the net income (loss) allocable to common shareowners for 2010 was $47.6 million compared to a loss of $(69.7) million in 2009.    FFO and FFO per Share    Our FFO was $237.3 million for 2010 compared to $55.0 million for 2009. FFO per diluted share was $2.86 in 2010 compared to $0.68 in 2009. Adjusted FFO in 2009, which excludes impairment, litigation and restructuring charges, was $248.7 million. Adjusted FFO per diluted share was $3.06 in 2009.

Amounts are net of intercompany transactions. The Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented at 100% in order to allow for measurement of their performance as a whole, without regard to our ownership interest. In our consolidated financial statements, we account for investments in the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures under the equity method.         (2)      Amortization of our additional basis in the Operating Partnership included in depreciation and amortization was $4.9 million in both 2009 and 2008. Also, amortization of our additional basis included in equity in income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $1.9 million in both 2009 and 2008.         (3)      See “Results of Operations– Use of Non-GAAP Measures” for the definition and discussion of EBITDA and FFO.         (4)      Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.              39          Consolidated Businesses    Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $666.1 million, a $5.4 million or 0.8% decrease over 2008. Minimum rents decreased by $11.3 million, due to decreases in rent per square foot, primarily as a result of rent relief, and decreased average occupancy. Percentage rents decreased due to lower tenant sales. Expense recoveries decreased primarily due to decreases in occupancy and the lower level of recoveries from in-place tenants. Management, leasing, and development revenue increased primarily due to the collection of development fees on the Macao project. Other income increased primarily due to an increase in lease cancellation revenue, which was partially offset by decreases in parking-related revenue and sponsorship income.    Total expenses were $754.1 million, a $35.7 million or 5.0% increase from 2008. Other operating expense decreased due to a reduction in pre-development costs, lower costs related to marketing and promotion, and decreased bad debt expense. In 2009, we incurred $12.3 million on pre-development activities. General and administrative expense was relatively flat with 2008. In 2009, we recognized a $2.5 million restructuring charge (see “Results of Operations – Restructuring”). Also in 2009, we recognized impairment charges of $166.7 million on The Pier Shops and Regency Square. In 2008, we recognized a $117.9 million impairment charge on our Oyster Bay project (see “Results of Operations – The Pier Shops at Caesars,” “Results of Operations Regency Square” and &#8220;Results of Operations – Oyster Bay”). Interest expense decreased due to the lower rates on floating rate debt and lower outstanding debt as a result of the return of the Macao deposit, offset partially by the termination of interest capitalization on the Oyster Bay project in the fourth quarter of 2008.    Gains on land sales and other nonoperating income decreased by $3.9 million in 2009. There were no gains on land sales in 2009, compared to $2.8 million of gains in 2008. Interest income declined in 2009 due to overall lower average interest rates.    Unconsolidated Joint Ventures    Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $272.5 million, a $0.7 million or 0.3% increase from 2008. Percentage rents decreased primarily due to lower tenant sales. Expense recoveries increased primarily due to increases in property taxes and electricity recoveries, increased revenue from marketing and promotion services, and adjustments in 2008 to prior estimated recoveries at certain centers.    Total expenses increased by $39.3 million or 20.2%, to $234.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to litigation charges of $38.5 million recognized in 2009 (see “Results of Operations – Litigation Charges”). Maintenance, taxes, and utilities expense increased due to higher property taxes, partially offset by decreased electricity expense. Other operating expense increased primarily due to professional fees. Depreciation expense decreased primarily due to changes in depreciable lives of tenant allowances in connection with early terminations.    As a result of the foregoing, income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures decreased by $39.2 million to $38.3 million. Our equity in income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $11.5 million, a $23.9 million decrease from 2008. In 2008, we recognized an impairment charge of $8.3 million related to our investment in a development project in Sarasota, Florida.    Net Income (Loss)    Net loss increased by $71.1 million to a $79.2 million loss in 2009, due to the increased impairment charges and the litigation charges. After allocation of income to noncontrolling and preferred interests, the net loss allocable to common shareowners for 2009 was a loss of $69.7 million compared to a loss of $86.7 million in 2008.    FFO and FFO per Share    Our FFO was $55.0 million for 2009 compared to $122.2 million for 2008. FFO per diluted share was $0.68 in 2009 compared to $1.51 in 2008. Our Adjusted FFO, which excludes 2009 impairment, litigation and restructuring charges and 2008 impairment charges, was $248.7 million for 2009 compared to $248.5 million for 2008. Adjusted FFO per diluted share was $3.06 in 2009, a decrease of 0.6% from $3.08 in 2008. See “Results of Operations – Use of Non-GAAP Measures” for the definition of FFO and “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Taubman Centers, Inc. Common Shareowners to Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations.”           40            Application of Critical Accounting Policies    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures. Some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgment, often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We are required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies.    Valuation of Shopping Centers    The viability of all projects under construction or development, including those owned by Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, are regularly evaluated under applicable accounting requirements, including requirements relating to abandonment of assets or changes in use. To the extent a project, or individual components of the project, are no longer considered to have value, the related capitalized costs are charged against operations. Additionally, all properties are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment of a shopping center owned by consolidated entities is recognized when the sum of expected cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying value of the property. Other than temporary impairment of an investment in an Unconsolidated Joint Venture is recognized when the carrying value is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value, including the results of discounted cash flow and other valuation techniques. The expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change, including (1) changes in the national, regional, and/or local economic climates, (2) competition from other shopping centers, stores, clubs, mailings, and the internet, (3) increases in operating costs, (4) bankruptcy and/or other changes in the condition of third parties, including anchors and tenants, (5) expected holding period, and (6) availability of credit. These factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change, and, as a result, an impairment could be considered to have occurred. To the extent impairment has occurred, the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged to income.    No impairment charges were recognized in 2010. In 2009, we recognized impairment charges of $107.7 million and $59.0 million related to The Pier Shops and Regency Square, respectively. In 2008, we recognized impairment charges of $117.9 million and $8.3 million related to our Oyster Bay and Sarasota projects, respectively (see “Results of Operations”). As of December 31, 2010, the consolidated net book value of our properties was $2.3 billion, representing over 90% of our consolidated assets. We also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures with a total combined net book value of $0.7 billion. These amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows.    Capitalization of Development Costs    In developing shopping centers, we typically obtain land or land options, zoning and regulatory approvals, anchor commitments, and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which we may incur significant costs. We capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion. Prior to this time, we expense all costs relating to a potential development, including payroll, and include these costs in Funds from Operations (see "Results of Operations – Use of Non-GAAP Measures").    On an ongoing basis, we continue to assess the probability of a project going forward and whether the asset is impaired. In addition, we also assess whether there are sufficient substantive development activities in a given period to support the capitalization of carrying costs, including interest capitalization.    Many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control, including (1) changes in the national, regional, and/or local economic climates, (2) competition from other shopping centers, stores, clubs, mailings, and the internet, (3) availability and cost of financing, (4) changes in regulations, laws, and zoning, and (5) decisions made by third parties, including anchors. These factors could cause our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change. If a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion, a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur.    Our $46.7 million balance of development pre-construction costs as of December 31, 2010 consists primarily of $40 million of land and site improvements relating to our Oyster Bay project. The balance also includes land for future development in Atlanta, Georgia. See “Results of Operations – Oyster Bay” regarding the status of the Oyster Bay project.           41            Valuation of Accounts and Notes Receivable    Rents and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income; they represent approximately 90% of our revenues. In generating this income, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. The collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies, changes in the economy, and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements. While we estimate potentially uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates. Also, if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement, receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations. Bad debt expense was less than 1% of total revenues in 2010, while bankruptcy filings affected 0.7% of tenant leases during the year. Since 1991, the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than 2% of annual revenues.    Notes receivable at December 31, 2010 totaled $10.5 million. Valuation of the recoverability of notes receivable is dependent on management’s estimates of the collectibility of contractual principal and interest payments, which are inherently judgmental.    Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets    We currently have deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws. Our temporary differences primarily relate to deferred compensation, net operating loss carryforwards and depreciation. We reduce our deferred tax assets through valuation allowances to the amount where realization is more likely than not assured, considering all available evidence, including expected future taxable earnings.   Expected future taxable earnings require certain significant judgments and estimates, including those relating to our management company's profitability, the timing and amounts of gains on land sales, the profitability of our Asian operations, the profitability of the unitary filing group for the Michigan Business Tax, and other factors affecting the results of operations of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Changes in any of these factors could cause our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets to change materially. We also have Michigan business income tax and modified gross receipts tax, which are subject to the accounting requirements for income taxes. As of December 31, 2010, we had a net federal, state and foreign deferred tax asset of $7.5 million, after a valuation allowance of $10.2 million.    Valuations for Acquired Property and Intangibles    Upon acquisition of an investment property, including that of an additional interest in an asset already partially owned (unless it was already consolidated), we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired. These assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly accepted valuation techniques. The estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect the historical operations of the property, known trends and changes expected in current market and economic conditions which would impact the property’s operations, and our plans for such property. These estimates of cash flows and valuations are particularly important for the recording of the acquisition at fair value, and allocation of purchase price between land, building and improvements, and other identifiable intangibles.

Capital Resources    Our internally generated funds and distributions from operating centers and other investing activities, augmented by use of our existing lines of credit, provide resources to maintain our current operations and assets and pay dividends. Generally, our need to access the capital markets is limited to refinancing debt obligations at maturity and funding major capital investments. See “Capital Spending” for more details. Market conditions may limit our sources of funds for these financing activities and our ability to refinance our debt obligations at present principal amounts, interest rates, and other terms.    We are financed with property-specific secured debt and we have two unencumbered center properties (Willow Bend and Stamford, a 50% owned Unconsolidated Joint Venture property). The three loans that matured in 2010 were refinanced at higher principal amounts than the previous loan balances. For the terms of these new loans, see “Results of Operations – Debt Transactions.”    In 2011, loans on three of our centers (International Plaza, Fair Oaks, and Regency Square) mature.    In January 2011, the International Plaza loan was extended to a maturity of January 2012.  The principal balance on the loan was required to be paid down by $52.6 million. We funded our $26.4 million beneficial share of the paydown with funds from our revolving lines of credit. The principal on the loan is now $272.4 million at 100%, and $136.5 million at our beneficial share. The rate on the loan had been fixed at 5.01% due to an interest rate swap that also matured in January.  The loan has now reverted to a floating rate at LIBOR plus 1.15%. The extended loan is prepayable at any time and has an additional one-year extension option.    The $250 million Fair Oaks loan, $125 million at our beneficial share, matures in April 2011 and has two one-year extension options. Currently the loan is fixed at 4.22% due to an interest rate swap that also matures in April. Notice has been given to the lender to exercise the option to extend the maturity to April 2012. When the loan is extended, the loan will revert to a floating rate at LIBOR plus 1.40%. However the loan is prepayable, and we believe we can fully refinance the principal balance, if we choose to do so.    The $72.7 million Regency Square loan matures in November 2011. In September 2010, our Board of Directors concluded that it was in our best interest to discontinue financial support of Regency Square. We have begun discussions with the lender regarding the transfer of ownership of this property. A default on this loan will not trigger any cross defaults on our other indebtedness. The loan was not in default as of December 31, 2010. We will continue to accrue the results of the center until the ownership of Regency Square is transferred in satisfaction of the obligations under the debt. However, we are not obligated to fund cash shortfalls of the center (see “Results of Operations – Regency Square”).    Summaries of 2010 Capital Activities and Transactions    As of December 31, 2010, we had a consolidated cash balance of $19.3 million. We also have secured lines of credit of $550 million and $40 million. As of December 31, 2010, $406 million was available under these facilities. Both lines of credit have been extended to February 2012.  In connection with the extension of the $550 million line of credit, the borrowing limits attributable to each of the three centers securing the line were reallocated.  Considering the facilities as adjusted, $447 million would have been available as of December 31, 2010. Twelve banks participate in our $550 million line of credit and the failure of one bank to fund a draw on our line does not negate the obligation of the other banks to fund their pro-rata shares.    Our $135 million loan at The Pier Shops is currently in default. We will continue to accrue the results of operations of the center until the foreclosure process is complete and the ownership of The Pier Shops is transferred in satisfaction of the obligations under the debt. However, there is no cash impact as we are not obligated to fund cash shortfalls of the center (see “Results of Operations – The Pier Shops at Caesars”).    Operating Activities    Our net cash provided by operating activities was $264.6 million in 2010, compared to $235.6 million in 2009 and $251.8 million in 2008. See also “Results of Operations” for descriptions of 2010, 2009, and 2008 transactions affecting operating cash flow.             46            Investing Activities    Net cash used in investing activities was $44.8 million in 2010, compared to $6.3 million provided in 2009 and $111.1 million used in 2008. Additions to properties in 2010 related primarily to tenant improvements at existing centers and other capital items. Additions to properties in 2009 included tenant allowances and asset replacement costs at existing centers, site improvements, and other capital items. Additions to properties in 2008 related to the construction of Partridge Creek, our Oyster Bay Project, and the expansion and renovation at Twelve Oaks, as well as other development activities and other capital items. A tabular presentation of 2010 and 2009 capital spending is shown in “Capital Spending.”    In 2008, we exercised our option to purchase interests in Partridge Creek from the third-party owner for $11.8 million (see “Note 3 – Properties – The Mall at Partridge Creek” to our consolidated financial statements). In 2008, a $54.3 million contribution was made related to our acquisition of a 25% interest in The Mall at Studio City. In 2009, the $54.3 million was returned to us when our agreements terminated because the financing for the project was not completed. Net proceeds from sales of peripheral land were $3.1 million and $6.3 million in 2010 and 2008, respectively. The timing of land sales is variable and proceeds from land sales can vary significantly from period to period. During 2010, we issued $2.9 million in notes receivable and received $1.6 million in repayment. During 2009, we issued $7.2 million in notes receivable to fund the noncontrolling partner’s share of a settlement at Westfarms that was paid in December 2009 (see “Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies – Litigation” to our consolidated financial statements). Also in 2009, we received a $4.5 million repayment of a note receivable. Contributions to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures in 2010 and 2009 included $3.6 million and $26.8 million to fund our share of the settlement at Westfarms. Contributions to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures in 2009 and 2008 included $1.0 million and $7.2 million, respectively, of funding and costs related to our Sarasota joint venture. Distributions in excess of earnings from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures provided $32.8 million in 2010, compared to $36.9 million in 2009 and $63.3 million in 2008. The amount in 2010 included $21 million of excess proceeds from the Arizona Mills refinancing. The amount in 2008 included $53.4 million in excess proceeds from the Fair Oaks refinancing.    Financing Activities    Net cash used in financing activities was $216.7 million in 2010 compared to $284.9 million in 2009 and $127.3 million in 2008. Payments of debt and for issuance costs, net of proceeds from the issuance of debt, were $33.3 million in 2010, compared to $105.0 million in 2009, with payments in 2009 being funded in part using the returned deposit from The Mall at Studio City. Proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of payments and issuance costs, were $93.2 million in 2008. In 2010, $2.5 million was received in connection with incentive plans, compared to $14.7 million and $3.8 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Total dividends and distributions paid were $185.6 million, $192.5 million, and $221.3 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Common dividends paid in 2010 include the special dividend paid in December 2010. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Dividends.” Common dividends paid in 2009 increased over 2008 primarily due to the timing of quarterly dividend payments. Distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2008 included $51.3 million of excess proceeds from the refinancing of International Plaza.    Beneficial Interest in Debt    At December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership's debt and its beneficial interest in the debt of its Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures totaled $2,872.6 million, with an average interest rate of 5.43% excluding amortization of debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs. These costs are reported as interest expense in the results of operations. Beneficial interest in debt includes debt used to fund development and expansion costs. Beneficial interest in construction work in progress totaled $63.5 million as of December 31, 2010, which includes $14.5 million of assets on which interest is being capitalized. The following table presents information about our beneficial interest in debt as of December 31, 2010:           47                       Amount          Interest Rate  Including Spread            (in millions)                 Fixed rate debt      $  2,330.5        5.77  %  (1) (2)                              Floating rate debt:                          Swapped to January 2011         162.8        5.01  %         Swapped through March 2011         125.0        4.22  %    Swapped through October 2012         15.0        5.95  %    Swapped through August 2020         124.5        4.99  %             427.3        4.80  %  (1)    Floating month to month         114.8        1.02  %  (1)    Total floating rate debt      $  542.1        4.00  %  (1)                              Total beneficial interest in debt      $  2,872.6        5.43  %  (1)                              Amortization of financing costs  (3)                  0.22  %    Average all-in rate                  5.65  %  (2)          (1)      Represents weighted average interest rate before amortization of financing costs.         (2)      The Pier Shops’ loan is in default. Interest is accruing at the default rate of 10.01% versus the original stated rate of 6.01%. Excluding our beneficial interest in The Pier Shops’ debt of $104.6 million from the table changes the average fixed rate to 5.57% and the average all-in rate to 5.47%.         (3)      Financing costs include debt issuance costs and costs related to interest rate agreements of certain fixed rate debt.         (4)       Amounts in table may not add due to rounding.       Sensitivity Analysis    We have exposure to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and interest rate instruments. We use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposure to interest rate risks inherent in variable rate debt and refinancings. We routinely use cap, swap, and treasury lock agreements to meet these objectives. Based on the Operating Partnership's beneficial interest in floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2010, a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates on this floating rate debt would decrease or increase cash flows and annual earnings by approximately $3.7 million, respectively. Based on our consolidated debt and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2010, a one percent increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $77.0 million, while a one percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $80.8 million.             48          Contractual Obligations    In conducting our business, we enter into various contractual obligations, including those for debt, capital leases for property improvements, operating leases for land and office space, purchase obligations (primarily for construction), and other long-term commitments. Detail of these obligations as of December 31, 2010 for our consolidated businesses, including expected settlement periods, is contained below:               Payments due by period               Total          Less than 1  year (2011)          1-3 years  (2012-2013)          3-5 years  (2014-2015)          More than 5  years (2016+)               (in millions)                                                          Debt  (1) (2)      $  2,656.6        $  634.5        $  174.8        $  1,148.7        $  698.5       Interest payments  (1) (2)         561.4           131.2           212.5           157.7           60.0       Capital lease obligations         0.1           0.1                                           Operating leases  (3)         401.4           8.7           19.2           15.1           358.5       Purchase obligations:                                                                 Planned capital spending  (4)         153.4           78.4           75.0                               Other purchase obligations  (3)(5)         10.6           2.8           4.8           3.0                   Other long-term liabilities and  commitments (6)         63.0           0.9           2.4           2.7           57.0       Total      $  3,846.5        $  856.5        $  488.8        $  1,327.1        $  1,174.0             (1)      The settlement periods for debt do not consider extension options. Amounts relating to interest on floating rate debt are calculated based on the debt balances and interest rates as of December 31, 2010.         (2)      The Pier Shops’ loan is in default and The Regency Square loan is expected to be in default in 2011. They are shown as an obligation in the current year. The debt on the Pier Shop’s loan is accruing interest at the default rate. Other than the interest accrued at December 31, 2010, interest related to The Pier Shops’ is excluded from the table because of the uncertain length of time the debt will remain outstanding. Regency Square is included through the November 2011 maturity date. See “Note 3 – Properties – The Pier Shops” and “Note 3 – Properties – Regency Square” to our consolidated financial statements.         (3)      Excludes The Pier Shops.         (4)      In 2012, $75 million will be paid upon opening of City Creek Center.         (5)      Excludes purchase agreements with cancellation provisions of 90 days or less.         (6)      Other long-term liabilities consist of various accrued liabilities, most significantly assessment bond obligations and long-term incentive compensation.         (7)      Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.       Loan Commitments and Guarantees    Certain loan agreements contain various restrictive covenants, including a minimum net worth requirement, a maximum payout ratio on distributions, a minimum debt yield ratio, a maximum leverage ratio, minimum interest coverage ratios, and a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio, the latter being the most restrictive. This covenant requires that we maintain a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio of more than 1.5 over a trailing 12-month period. As of December 31, 2010, our fixed charges coverage ratio was 2.1. Other than The Pier Shops’ loan, which is in default, we are in compliance with all of our covenants and loan obligations as of December 31, 2010. The default on this loan did not trigger, and a default on the Regency Square loan will not trigger, any cross defaults on our other indebtedness. See “Note ;3 – Properties – The Pier Shops” and “Note 3 – Properties – Regency Square” to our consolidated financial statements. The maximum payout ratio on distributions covenant limits the payment of distributions generally to 95% of funds from operations, as defined in the loan agreements, except as required to maintain our tax status, pay preferred distributions, and for distributions related to the sale of certain assets. See “Note 7 – Notes Payable – Debt Covenants and Guarantees” to our consolidated financial statements for more details on loan guarantees.    Cash Tender Agreement    A. Alfred Taubman has the annual right to tender units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and cause us to purchase the tendered interests at a purchase price based on a market valuation of TCO on the trading date immediately preceding the date of the tender. See “Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies – Cash Tender” to our consolidated financial statements for more details.             49            Capital Spending    City Creek Center    We have finalized agreements regarding City Creek Center, a mixed-use project in Salt Lake City, Utah. The 0.7 million square foot retail component of the project will include Macy’s and Nordstrom as anchors. We are currently providing development and leasing services and will be the manager for the retail space, which we will own under a long-term participating lease. City Creek Reserve, Inc. (CCRI), an affiliate of the LDS Church, is the participating lessor and is providing all of the construction financing. We own 100% of the leasehold interest in the retail buildings and property. CCRI has an option to purchase our interest at fair value at various points in time over the term of the lease. We expect an approximately 11% to 12% return on our approximately $76 million investment, of which $75 million will be paid to CCRI upon opening of the retail center.  As required, we have issued to CCRI a $25 million letter of credit, which will remain in place until the $75 million is paid.  As of December 31, 2010, the capitalized cost of this project was approximately $1 million. Construction is progressing and we are leasing space for a March 2012 opening.    Outlets    In 2010, we formed a joint venture to seek development sites for outlets. Taubman will hold a 90% ownership interest in the joint venture for any projects that move forward.    2010 and 2009 Capital Spending    Capital spending for routine maintenance of the shopping centers is generally recovered from tenants. Capital spending during 2010 is summarized in the following table:                2010  (1)               Consolidated Businesses          Beneficial Interest in Consolidated Businesses          Unconsolidated Joint Ventures          Beneficial Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures               (in millions)        Existing centers:                                         Projects with incremental GLA or anchor replacement      $  15.2        $  15.2                         Projects with no incremental GLA and other         4.2           4.0        $  2.4        $  1.2       Mall tenant allowances  (2)         43.4           40.6           1.7           0.9       Asset replacement costs reimbursable by tenants         16.0           14.3           6.4           3.6                                                            Corporate office improvements, technology, equipment, and other         1.3           1.3                                                                                    Additions to properties      $  80.0        $  75.5        $  10.5        $  5.7              (1)      Costs are net of intercompany profits and are computed on an accrual basis.

(4)      Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.       The Operating Partnership's share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased, committed under contracts during the year, excluding expansion space and new developments, was $37.56 in 2010 and $19.99 in 2009. Excluding allowances for a new theater and the repositioning and rebranding of certain centers, including a substantial number of luxury tenants, the Operating Partnership’s share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased, committed under contracts during the year, excluding expansion space and new developments, was $16.71 in 2010. In addition, the Operating Partnership's share of capitalized leasing and tenant coordination costs excluding new developments was $8.4 million and $7.6 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, or $7.10 and $6.36, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, per square foot leased.    Planned Capital Spending    The following table summarizes planned capital spending for 2011:                2011  (1)               Consolidated Businesses          Beneficial Interest in Consolidated Businesses          Unconsolidated Joint Ventures          Beneficial Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures               (in millions)        Existing centers  (2)      $  77.0        $  69.3        $  15.7        $  8.4       Corporate office improvements, technology, and equipment         1.4           1.4                               Total      $  78.4        $  70.7        $  15.7        $  8.4              (1)      Costs are net of intercompany profits.         (2)      Primarily includes costs related to renovations, mall tenant allowances, and asset replacement costs reimbursable by tenants. Also, includes the cost to acquire the building that will be vacated by Saks Fifth Avenue at Cherry Creek in March 2011.         (3)      Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.       Estimates of future capital spending include only projects approved by our Board of Directors and, consequently, estimates will change as new projects are approved.           51            Disclosures regarding planned capital spending, including estimates regarding timing of openings, capital expenditures, occupancy, and returns on new developments are forward-looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to (1) actual results of negotiations with anchors, tenants, and contractors, (2) timing and outcome of litigation and entitlement processes, (3) changes in the scope, number, and valuation of projects, (4) cost overruns, (5) timing of expenditures, (6) availability of and cost of financing and other financing considerations, (7) actual time to start construction and complete projects, (8) changes in economic climate, (9) competition from others attracting tenants and customers, (10) increases in operating costs, (11) timing of tenant openings, and (12) early lease terminations and bankruptcies.    Dividends    We pay regular quarterly dividends to our common and preferred shareowners. Dividends to our common shareowners are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash available to us, our financial condition, capital and other requirements, and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income prior to net capital gains to our shareowners, as well as meet certain other requirements. We must pay these distributions in the taxable year the income is recognized, or in the following taxable year if they are declared during the last three months of the taxable year, payable to shareowners of record on a specified date during such period and paid during January of the following year. Such distributions are treated as paid by us and received by our shareowners on December 31 of the year in which they are declared. In addition, at our election, a distribution for a taxable year may be declared in the following taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. These distributions qualify as dividends paid for the 90% REIT distribution test for the previous year and are taxable to holders of our capital stock in the year in which paid. Preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings, cash availability, or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends.    The annual determination of our common dividends is based on anticipated Funds from Operations available after preferred dividends and our REIT taxable income, as well as assessments of annual capital spending, financing considerations, and other appropriate factors.    Any inability of the Operating Partnership or its Joint Ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, including development activities and expansions, may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations, thereby possibly reducing distributions to partners of the Operating Partnership and funds available to us for the payment of dividends.    On December 9, 2010, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.4375 per common share, $0.50 per share on our 8% Series G Preferred Stock, and $0.4765625 on our 7.625% Series H Preferred Stock, all of which were paid on December 31, 2010 to shareowners of record on December 17, 2010. We also declared a special dividend of $0.1834 per share. The special dividend was payable December 31, 2010 to common shareholders of record on December 17, 2010. This dividend was a result of the taxation of capital gains incurred from the liquidation of TRG's private REIT and restructuring of our ownership in International Plaza, a property in Tampa, Florida. The private REIT was formed in 1999 to raise capital from a foreign investor, who has since been bought out.  The dividend was necessary to fully distribute all of Taubman Centers' projected taxable income for the 2010 tax year and comply with the REIT distribution requirements under federal income tax law.  The liquidation has no impact on our funds from operations, our net income or our percentage ownership of International Plaza.                   52          Item 7A .
