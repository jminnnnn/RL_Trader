Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ---------------------------------------------    The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data, the Financial  Statements of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. and the Notes thereto and the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements of The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership and the Notes thereto.  General Background and Performance Measurement    The Company,  through its interest in and as managing  general partner of TRG, participates in TRG's Managed  Businesses.  TRG's Managed Businesses consist of: (i) Taubman  Shopping  Centers that TRG  controls by  ownership  or  contractual agreement,   development   projects  for  future   regional   shopping   centers (Development   Projects)  and  The  Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership  (the Manager), (collectively, the Consolidated Businesses); and (ii) Taubman Shopping Centers  partially  owned through joint ventures with third parties that are not controlled  (Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures).  The Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are  accounted  for under the  equity  method  in TRG's  Consolidated  Financial Statements.    Certain  aspects  of  the  performance  of the  Managed  Businesses  are  best understood by measuring  their  performance as a whole,  without regard to TRG's ownership interest. For example, mall tenant sales and shopping center occupancy trends fit this  category  and are so analyzed  below.  In  addition,  trends in certain  items of revenue  and  expense  are often best  understood  in the same fashion, and the discussions following take this approach when appropriate. When relevant,  these  items  are  also  discussed  separately  with  regard  to  the Consolidated Businesses and the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.  Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues    Over  the long  term,  the  level of mall  tenant  sales  is the  single  most important  determinant of revenues of the Taubman  Shopping Centers because mall tenants  provide  over 90% of these  revenues  and  because  mall  tenant  sales determine  the  amount  of  rent,  percentage  rent,  and  recoverable  expenses (together,  total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However, levels of mall tenant sales can be  considerably  more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs.    The Company  believes that the ability of tenants to pay  occupancy  costs and earn  profits  over long  periods of time  increases  as sales per  square  foot increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot.    The following table summarizes occupancy costs, excluding utilities,  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales.                                             1997         1996         1995                                            ----         ----         ----  Mall tenant sales (in thousands)     $3,086,259   $2,827,245   $2,739,393 Sales per square foot                       371          365          346 Sales per square foot (excluding  theaters and tenants greater    than 40,000 square feet)                  384          377          364   Minimum rents                              10.1%        10.4%        10.4% Percentage rents                            0.3          0.3          0.3 Expense recoveries                          4.4          4.5          4.4                                            ----         ----         ---- Mall tenant occupancy costs                14.8%        15.2%        15.1%                                            ====         ====         ====                                          19        Mall  tenant  occupancy  costs  as a  percentage  of sales  decreased  in 1997 primarily  due to Centers  acquired in 1997 and late 1996 (Results of Operations - --  Acquisitions).  These Centers have lower  occupancy costs than the portfolio average and consequently provide a source of future revenue growth.  Occupancy    Historically,  average  annual  occupancy for TRG as a whole has been within a narrow band. In the last ten years,  average annual occupancy has ranged between 86.5% and 88.7%.  Mall tenant average  occupancy  rates for the last three years are as follows:                     Year                 Mall Tenant Average Occupancy                    ----                 -----------------------------                    1997                           87.6%                    1996                           87.4                    1995                           88.0  Rental Rates    As leases have expired in the Taubman Shopping Centers, TRG has generally been able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. In a period of increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In  periods  of  slower  growth or declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason.  However,  Center revenues  nevertheless  increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current  rental  rates that are usually  higher  than the  average  rates for existing leases. The following table contains certain information  regarding per square foot base rent,  excluding  renewals,  at the 18 Taubman Shopping Centers that have been owned and open for five years.

TRG anticipates that the spread in 1998 will be somewhat higher than in 1997. However, this statistic is difficult to predict in part because  TRG's  leasing  policies and  practices  may result in early lease terminations  with actual average  closing rents which may vary from the average rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations. In addition, the opening or closing of large  tenant  spaces,  which  generally  pay a lower rent per square foot, can significantly affect the spread in a given year.  Seasonality    The regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall tenant sales  highest in the  fourth  quarter  due to the  Christmas  season,  and with lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and  back-to-school  events.  While  minimum  rents and  recoveries  are generally not subject to seasonal  factors,  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter,  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Accordingly,  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.                                          20        The following  table  summarizes  certain  quarterly  operating data for TRG's Managed Businesses for 1997:                                1st       2nd       3rd        4th                             Quarter   Quarter   Quarter    Quarter     Total                              1997      1997      1997       1997       1997                           ----------------------------------------------------                                             (in thousands)  Mall tenant sales          $600,709  $629,906  $692,487  $1,163,157  $3,086,259 Revenues                    130,677   134,756   137,728     157,192     560,353  Occupancy:   Average Occupancy            86.5%    86.8%     87.0%       89.5%       87.6%   Ending Occupancy             86.4%    87.1%     87.2%       90.3%       90.3% Leased Space                   88.7%    89.5%     90.8%       92.3%       92.3%    Because the  seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and  recoveries,  mall tenant  occupancy costs (the sum of minimum rents,   percentage  rents  and  expense  recoveries)   relative  to  sales  are considerably  higher in the first  three  quarters  than they are in the  fourth quarter.  The following table summarizes  occupancy costs,  excluding utilities, for mall tenants as a percentage of sales for each quarter of 1997:                                   1st       2nd       3rd       4th                                Quarter   Quarter   Quarter   Quarter   Total                                 1997      1997      1997      1997     1997                              -------------------------------------------------  Minimum rents                   12.6%     11.8%     11.3%      7.3%    10.1% Percentage rents                 0.2       0.3       0.3       0.2      0.3 Expense recoveries               5.2       5.1       4.7       3.5      4.4                                 ----      ----      ----      ----     ---- Mall tenant occupancy costs     18.0%     17.2%     16.3%     11.0%    14.8%                                 ====      ====      ====      ====     ====   Results of Operations  Equity Transactions    In October 1997,  the Company used the $200 million  public  offering of eight million shares of 8.3% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock to acquire a Series A Preferred  Equity interest in TRG that entitles the Company to income and distributions  (in the form of guaranteed  payments) in amounts equal to the dividends  payable on the Company's Series A Preferred Stock. In addition to the income  from  the  Company's  preferred  equity  interest  in TRG,  the  Company continues to participate in the income allocable to TRG partnership  unitholders to the extent of the Company's  ownership in TRG, including  adjustments arising from the Company's  additional basis in TRG's net assets.  TRG bore all expenses of the offering,  which have been  accounted for as a reduction of the proceeds. TRG used the net proceeds to pay down debt under TRG's existing revolving credit and  commercial  paper  facilities,  which were used to fund the  acquisition of Regency Square in September 1997.    In December 1996, the Company  purchased newly issued TRG units of partnership interest with the $75 million proceeds from the Company's December 1996 offering of 5.97 million  shares of common stock.  TRG bore all expenses of the Company's offering which have been accounted for as a reduction of the proceeds from TRG's issuance of units.  TRG used the net  proceeds  to pay down short term  floating rate debt and to acquire La Cumbre  Plaza.  Also in December  1996,  the Company exchanged common shares for TRG units of partnership interest newly issued under TRG's  incentive  option  plan.  Additionally  in  1996,  TRG  issued  units  of partnership  interest  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of the  remaining interest in Fairlane Town Center.  Acquisitions    The following discussion of TRG's 1997 acquisitions  contains  forward-looking statements  regarding  the  impact of these  acquisitions  on EBITDA  (EBITDA is defined and described in Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Distributions).  The actual  impact  may  vary  based  on a  variety  of  factors,  including  actual occupancy,  rents achieved and operating expenses of the Centers.  See Note 3 to TRG's   consolidated   financial   statements  for  further  discussion  of  the acquisitions.                                          21      The Falls - ---------    In December 1997,  TRG acquired The Falls shopping  center for $156 million in cash.  The  operating  results  of The  Falls  have been  consolidated  in TRG's financial  statements from the acquisition  date. TRG borrowed under an existing revolving credit facility to fund the  acquisition.  The acquisition is expected to produce EBITDA of about 8% of the acquisition cost in 1998.  Regency Square - --------------    In September  1997, TRG acquired  Regency Square  (Regency)  shopping  center, located in Richmond,  Virginia,  for $123.9 million in cash. The acquisition was initially funded with borrowings under TRG's revolving credit facilities,  which were paid down in October 1997 with the proceeds from TRG's issuance of Series A Preferred  Equity.  The operating  results of Regency have been  consolidated in TRG's financial statements from the acquisition date. Regency is expected to add EBITDA of approximately 8% of the acquisition cost in 1998.  La Cumbre Plaza - ---------------    In December 1996,  TRG acquired a 100%  leasehold  interest in La Cumbre Plaza (La Cumbre) located in Santa Barbara, California for $22.25 million in cash. The acquisition  was  funded  with  proceeds  from  an  issuance  of  TRG  units  of partnership interest.  The operating results of La Cumbre have been consolidated in TRG's financial statements from the acquisition date.  Fairlane Town Center - --------------------    In July 1996, TRG completed  transactions  that resulted in the acquisition of the 75% interest in Fairlane Town Center  (Fairlane)  previously held by a Joint Venture Partner.  In connection with the  transaction,  TRG issued to the former Joint  Venture  Partner  units  of  partnership   interest,   exchangeable   for approximately  6.1 million  shares of the Company's  common  stock,  which had a closing  price of $10.75 per share on the day prior to the  issuance  date.  TRG also assumed mortgage debt of approximately $26 million, representing the former Joint  Venture  Partner's  beneficial  interest  in the $34.6  million  mortgage encumbering  the property.  TRG used unsecured debt to fund the repayment of the 9.73% mortgage and the prepayment  penalty of  approximately  $1.2 million.  The operating  results  of  Fairlane  have  been  consolidated  in  TRG's  financial statements  from the acquisition  date.  Prior to the  acquisition  date,  TRG's interest  in  Fairlane  was   accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  as  an Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture.  In January 1998,  TRG redeemed the former Joint Venture Partner's units of partnership  interest for approximately $77.7 million (including costs).  Paseo Nuevo - -----------    In June 1996, TRG acquired a 100% leasehold  interest in Paseo Nuevo,  located in Santa  Barbara,  California,  for $37 million in cash. TRG borrowed under its existing lines of credit to fund the acquisition. The operating results of Paseo Nuevo have been consolidated in TRG's financial  statements from the acquisition date.  New Centers and Expansions    In November 1997,  TRG opened Arizona Mills, a 37% owned value  super-regional shopping center located in Tempe, Arizona. The Center opened 90% leased.                                          22        In July  1997,  TRG  opened  The Mall at  Tuttle  Crossing,  a  super-regional shopping  center  located in Columbus,  Ohio.  The Center was 95% leased at year end. TRG's  ownership  interest in The Mall at Tuttle  Crossing was subject to a long-term  participating lease with Tuttle Crossing Holding Co., a subsidiary of The Limited, Inc. (The Limited) for land and leasehold improvements. In December 1997,  TRG purchased  The Limited's  interests in the lease for $76.3 million in cash and took fee simple title to the underlying  land and buildings.  The lease had been  accounted  for as a capital  lease  with  capital  lease  assets and a capital lease  obligation of $55.3 million at the date of the  acquisition.  The purchase  is  anticipated  to  produce  a  return  of  approximately  8% of  the acquisition cost in 1998.    TRG opened a 135,000  square foot  expansion at Westfarms in August 1997.  The expansion   was   approximately   90%  leased  as  of  year  end.  In  addition, approximately  50,000 square feet of new mall stores opened at Biltmore in 1997. See also Liquidity and Capital  Resources -- Capital Spending for discussions of other planned expansion and development activities.  Memorial City Mall Lease    In November  1996,  TRG entered into an agreement to lease  Memorial City Mall (Memorial  City), a 1.4 million square foot shopping  center located in Houston, Texas. The lease of this unencumbered property grants TRG the exclusive right to manage,  lease and operate the  property.  TRG has the option to  terminate  the lease after the third full lease year by paying $2 million to the lessor. TRG is using this option  period to evaluate  the  redevelopment  opportunities  of the Center.  As a  development  project,  Memorial  City has been  excluded from all operating  statistics in this report,  and Memorial City's results of operations have been presented as a net line item in the following  tabular  comparisons of TRG's  results of  operations.  Memorial  City is expected to have an immaterial effect on EBITDA and net income during the option period.                                          23      Comparison of Fiscal Year 1997 to Fiscal Year 1996  Taubman Centers, Inc.    The  Company  is the  managing  general  partner  of TRG and  shares  in TRG's financial  performance  to the extent of its  ownership  percentage,  as well as earning an 8.3% return on its  preferred  equity  interest in TRG. The Company's average ownership percentage of TRG was 36.7% for 1997 and 34.5% for 1996. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had 50.8 million shares outstanding, up from 50.7 million at December 31, 1996.    The  Company's  income  from TRG in 1997  consists  of $4.1  million  from its preferred  equity interest in TRG and the Company's $33.5 million  proportionate share of TRG's income before  extraordinary  item. In 1996, the Company's income from TRG  consisted  of its $29.0  million  proportionate  share of TRG's income before  extraordinary  item. The Company's  proportionate  share of TRG's income before  extraordinary  item was reduced by $8.2 million in 1997 and $7.6 million in 1996, representing adjustments arising from the Company's additional basis in TRG's net assets. Income before extraordinary item for 1997 was $28.7 million or $0.48 per common share as compared to $20.7 million or $0.47 per common share in 1996.    The  Company  recognized  an  extraordinary  item of $(0.4)  million  in 1996, consisting of the  Company's  share of TRG's  extraordinary  item related to the extinguishment  of debt.  Net  income  for 1996 was $20.3  million  or $0.46 per common  share.  After  reduction of $4.1  million in dividends on the  Company's Series A Preferred Stock,  net income  available to common  shareowners for 1997 was $24.6 million or $0.48 per common share.  TRG  Occupancy and Mall Tenant Sales    Average  occupancy  in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers was 87.6% in 1997 versus 87.4% in 1996. Ending occupancy for the Taubman Shopping Centers at December 31, 1997 was 90.3% versus  88.0% at December 31, 1996.  Leased space at December 31, 1997 was 92.3% compared to 89.0% at the same date in 1996.    Total sales for Taubman Shopping Center mall tenants increased in 1997 by 9.2% to $3.09  billion  from $2.83  billion  in 1996.  Tenant  sales per square  foot increased  by 1.6% to $371 in 1997 from $365 in 1996.  Tenant  sales per  square foot,  excluding theaters and tenants greater than 40,000 square feet, increased by 1.9% to $384 in 1997 from $377 in 1996.  Mall tenant  sales for Centers  that were  owned  and  open  for all of 1997 and 1996  (which  excludes  all  Centers acquired in those  years,  as well as Tuttle  Crossing  and Arizona  Mills) were $2.85 billion,  a 1.6% increase over 1996.  Sales statistics for the first three quarters  of 1997 were  negatively  affected  by new  competition  near  certain Centers. The effect of the competition on sales moderated in the fourth quarter, after the anniversary date of the opening of the competing centers.                                            24

TRG expects that Memorial City's net operating  income will approximate the      ground rent payable under the lease for the immediate future. (2)  With the exception of the Supplemental Information,  amounts represent 100%      of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  Amounts  are net of  intercompany      profits.  The  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures are  accounted for under the      equity method in TRG's Consolidated Financial Statements.

(4)  Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding. (5)  Certain   1996  amounts   have  been   reclassified   to  conform  to  1997      classifications.                                           25      TRG --Consolidated Businesses - -----------------------------    Total revenues for 1997 were $301.6 million, a $39.7 million or 15.2% increase over 1996.  Minimum rents  increased  $24.1 million,  of which $21.4 million was caused by the 1997 and 1996  acquisitions,  and the opening of Tuttle  Crossing. The results of Fairlane have been  consolidated  in TRG's results  subsequent to the acquisition date in July 1996 (prior to that date Fairlane was accounted for under the equity method as an Unconsolidated Joint Venture).  Minimum rents also increased due to the expansion at Biltmore and tenant rollovers. Percentage rent increased primarily due to the acquisitions.  The increase in expense recoveries was primarily  due to the acquired  Centers and Tuttle  Crossing.  Other revenue increased  $1.9 million  primarily  due to an insurance  recovery,  a litigation settlement, and an increase in lease cancellation revenue.    Total  operating  costs  increased  $28.8 million,  or 12.5%.  Recoverable and depreciation  and  amortization   expenses   increased   primarily  due  to  the acquisitions and Tuttle Crossing.  Other operating expenses increased  primarily due to the acquisitions and Tuttle Crossing,  offset by a decrease in the charge to  operations   for   development   pre-construction   reserves.   General  and administrative  expense  increased by $3.9 million primarily due to increases in compensation  (including the continuing  phase-in of the long-term  compensation plan),  recruiter fees and relocation  charges,  travel, and training.  Interest expense increased due to an increase in debt used to finance Tuttle Crossing and capital  expenditures at other Consolidated  Businesses,  partially offset by an increase in capitalized  interest.  The acquisitions  were initially funded with debt which was  subsequently  paid down with the proceeds from the December 1996 and the October 1997 equity issuances.    Revenues  and expenses as  presented  in the  preceding  table differ from the amounts  shown in TRG's  consolidated  statement  of  operations  by the amounts representing  Memorial City's revenues and expenses,  which are presented in the preceding table as a net amount.  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - -----------------------------    Total revenues for 1997 were $258.8 million, a $6.5 million, or 2.5%, decrease from  1996,  representing  a $15.0  million  decrease  caused  by the  change of Fairlane from an Unconsolidated Joint Venture to a Consolidated Business, offset by  increases  due to the  openings  of  Arizona  Mills  and  the  expansion  at Westfarms,  in addition to increases at other  Centers.  The decrease in minimum rents was  primarily  due to Fairlane,  offset by Arizona  Mills,  Westfarms and increases  due to tenant  rollovers  at other  Centers.  The decrease in expense recoveries was primarily due to Fairlane, offset by Arizona Mills. Other revenue increased  by $1.3  million  primarily  due to gains on  peripheral  land sales, offset by a decrease in lease cancellation revenue and interest income.    Total operating  costs  decreased by $4.7 million,  or 2.7%, to $166.4 million for  1997  including  a $10.1  million  decrease  due to  Fairlane.  Recoverable expenses  decreased $5.4 million primarily due to Fairlane,  offset by increases due to Arizona Mills. Other operating costs decreased  primarily due to Fairlane and a  decrease  in bad  debt  expense.  Additionally,  included  in 1996  other operating expense was a nonrecurring $0.5 million payment to an anchor at one of the  Centers.  Interest  expense  increased  $1.0  million  primarily  due to an increase  in debt used to finance  Arizona  Mills and the  Westfarms  expansion, partially  offset by a decrease in debt related to Fairlane.  Operating costs as presented in the preceding  table differ from the amounts shown in the combined, summarized  financial statements of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures (Note 4 to TRG's financial statements) by the amount of intercompany profit.    As a result of the foregoing,  net income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures decreased by $1.9 million, or 2.0%, to $92.4 million. TRG's equity in net income of the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures was $52.3  million,  a 1.0% increase from 1996.  Net Income - ----------    As a result of the foregoing, TRG's income before extraordinary item increased by $11.2 million, or 13.3%, to $95.3 million for 1997. In 1996, TRG recognized a $(1.3)  million  extraordinary  charge  related to the  prepayment of Fairlane's debt.  After payment of $4.1 million in preferred  distributions to the Company, net income  available to  partnership  unitholders  for 1997 was $91.2  million, compared to $82.8 million in 1996.                                          26      Comparison of Fiscal Year 1996 to Fiscal Year 1995  Taubman Centers, Inc.    The Company's average ownership percentage of TRG was 34.5% for 1996 and 35.1% for 1995.  Equity  in income of TRG  consists  of the  Company's  $29.0  million proportionate  share of TRG's  income  before  extraordinary  items for 1996 and $28.0  million for 1995.  These amounts were reduced by $7.6 million in 1996 and $8.1  million  in 1995,  representing  adjustments  arising  from the  Company's additional basis in TRG's net assets.  Equity in income of TRG for 1995 includes a $1.8 million gain related to the disposition of Bellevue Center. Income before extraordinary  items for 1996 was $20.7  million  or $0.47 per  common  share as compared to $19.3 million or $0.44 per common share in 1995.    The  Company  recognized  an  extraordinary  item of $(0.4)  million  in 1996, consisting   of  its  share  of  TRG's   extraordinary   item   related  to  the extinguishment of debt. In 1995, the Company recognized  extraordinary  items of $5.8 million consisting of its share of TRG's extraordinary items related to the disposition  of  Bellevue  Center and the  related  extinguishment  of  Bellevue Center's debt, and other  extinguishment  of debt. Net income for 1996 was $20.3 million or $0.46 per common share  compared to $25.1 million or $0.57 per common share in 1995.  TRG  Occupancy and Mall Tenant Sales    Average  occupancy  in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers was 87.4% in 1996 versus 88.0% in 1995. Ending occupancy for the Taubman Shopping Centers at December 31, 1996 was 88.0% versus  89.4% at December 31, 1995.  Leased space at December 31, 1996 was 89.0% compared to 90.6% at the same date in 1995. Average occupancy for 1996 was somewhat  less than the previous  year's level but  comfortably  within TRG's historic range of average annual occupancy.    Total sales for Taubman Shopping Center mall tenants increased in 1996 by 3.2% to $2.83  billion  from $2.74  billion  in 1995.  Tenant  sales per square  foot increased  by 5.2% to $365 in 1996 from $346 in 1995.  Sales per square  foot in 1995 was $352,  excluding  Bellevue  Center.  Mall tenant sales for Centers that were owned and open for all of 1996 and 1995 were $2.81 billion, a 3.9% increase over 1995.                                           27      Comparison of Fiscal

Minimum rents for 1996 increased $18.8 million, of which $8.7 million was caused by the Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo acquisitions. The results of Fairlane have been  consolidated  in TRG's  results  subsequent to the  acquisition  date (prior to that date  Fairlane was  accounted  for under the equity  method as an Unconsolidated Joint Venture). Minimum rent also increased due to the expansions at Short  Hills and  Meadowood  and tenant  rollovers.  The  increase in expense recoveries was also  primarily due to the Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo  acquisitions and recoveries of increased  maintenance  costs and property taxes. The increase in other revenues of $3.9 million was primarily due to increases in revenue from management,   leasing,  and  development  services,   rental  fees  on  exterior advertising  signs and gains on sales of peripheral land,  partially offset by a decrease in lease cancellation revenue.    Total operating  costs  increased $22.6 million,  or 10.9%, to $229.7 million. The  increase in  recoverable  expenses  for 1996 was due to Fairlane  and Paseo Nuevo and to increases in maintenance costs and property taxes,  including those related to the expansion at Short Hills.  Other operating expenses increased due to Fairlane and Paseo  Nuevo,  and an increase in the charge to  operations  for development  pre-construction  reserves.  General  and  administrative  expenses increased  $2.0 million due  primarily to increases in  compensation,  including costs of the new long-term  performance  compensation plan and the allocation of internal  acquisition costs,  travel, and professional fees in 1996, offset by a decrease  resulting  from a $0.8  million  charge  in  1995  for  severance  and termination  benefits.  Interest expense increased $4.7 million due primarily to an increase in debt levels,  including  debt used to finance the  acquisition of Paseo Nuevo and capital  expenditures and the assumption of debt relating to the Fairlane acquisition,  and a decrease in capitalized interest,  partially offset by decreased  interest rates.  The increase in depreciation and amortization was due primarily to the acquisitions of Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo and the expansions at Short Hills and Meadowood.    Revenues  and expenses as  presented  in the  preceding  table differ from the amounts  shown  in  TRG's   consolidated   income   statements  by  the  amounts representing  Memorial City's revenues and expenses,  which are presented in the preceding table as a net amount.  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - -----------------------------    Total revenues for 1996 were $265.3 million,  a $25.8 million or 8.9% decrease from 1995, primarily  representing a $23.8 million decrease caused by the change in Fairlane from an Unconsolidated Joint Venture to a Consolidated  Business and by the November 1995  disposition of Bellevue  Center  (Bellevue).  Minimum rent decreases  due to Fairlane  and  Bellevue  were offset by  increases  due to the expansion  at  Woodfield  and tenant  rollovers.  Expense  recoveries  decreased primarily  due to Fairlane and Bellevue,  offset by increases at other  Centers. Other income  decreased due to a gain on the sale of peripheral land in 1995 and decreased  interest income in 1996, offset by an increase in lease  cancellation revenue in 1996. In 1995, an ordinary gain of $8.3 million was recognized on the disposition of Bellevue.    Total operating  costs decreased by $12.7 million,  or 6.9%, to $171.1 million for 1996,  representing  a $19.9 million  decrease due to Fairlane and Bellevue, offset by  increases  at other  Centers.  Recoverable  expenses  decreased  $6.4 million due to Fairlane and Bellevue,  offset by increases in maintenance  costs and property taxes.  Other  operating  costs  increased $0.5 million  reflecting increases in property  management  costs,  promotion and advertising  costs, bad debt expense and a nonrecurring  $0.5 million payment to an anchor at one of the Centers,  offset by decreases  due to Bellevue and  Fairlane.  Interest  expense decreased  $5.1  million  due to a  decrease  in debt  related to  Fairlane  and Bellevue and an increase in capitalized interest,  partially offset by increases due to an increase in debt used to finance  capital  expenditures  and to higher interest rates on certain debt refinanced in 1995.  Operating costs as presented in the preceding table differ from the amounts shown in the combined, summarized financial  statements  of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  (Note 4 to TRG's financial statements) by the amount of intercompany profit.                                          29        As a  result  of the  foregoing,  income  before  extraordinary  items  of the Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  was $94.3  million in 1996, a decrease of 12.1% from  1995.   TRG's  equity  in  income  before   extraordinary   items  of  the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures decreased $6.1 million, or 10.5%, to $51.8 million for 1996.  Net Income - ----------    As a  result  of  the  foregoing,  TRG's  income  before  extraordinary  items increased by $4.4 million,  or 5.5%,  to $84.1  million for 1996.  In 1996,  TRG recognized a $(1.3)  million  extraordinary  charge related to the prepayment of Fairlane's  debt. In 1995,  TRG recognized an $18.9 million  extraordinary  gain related  to the  disposition  of  Bellevue  and the  related  extinguishment  of Bellevue's  debt, and $(2.2)  million in  extraordinary  charges  related to the prepayment of debt at TRG and at one of its Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures.  Net income for 1996 was $82.8 million, compared to $96.3 million in 1995.                                             30      Liquidity and Capital Resources  Taubman Centers, Inc.    As of December 31, 1997,  the Company had a cash balance of $9.0 million,  the source  of  which  was  primarily  TRG's  distributions,  and  had  incurred  no indebtedness.  As of December  31,  1997,  the Company had 50.8  million  shares outstanding compared to 50.7 million at December 31, 1996.    On October 3, 1997,  the Company  issued eight million shares of 8.3% Series A Preferred  Stock under its $500  million  equity shelf  registration  statement. Dividends  accrue from the date of original  issuance and are payable in arrears on or  before  the last  day of each  calendar  quarter.  The  Company  used the proceeds to acquire a Series A Preferred  Equity  interest in TRG that  entitles the Company to  distributions  (in the form of  guaranteed  payments) in amounts equal to the dividends payable on the Company's Series A Preferred Stock.    During 1997 and 1996, the Company received  distributions from its partnership interest in TRG of $47.0 million and $41.3 million, respectively.  Additionally, the Company received preferred distributions from TRG of $4.1 million in 1997.    The Company  pays  regular  quarterly  dividends  to its common and  preferred shareowners.  The  Company's  ability to pay  dividends  is  affected by several factors,  most importantly,  the receipt of distributions from TRG. Dividends to its common  shareowners  are at the  discretion  of the Board of  Directors  and depend on the cash available to the Company,  its financial  condition,  capital and other  requirements,  and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.  Preferred  dividends  accrue  regardless  of whether  earnings,  cash availability, or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends.    On December 11, 1997, the Company declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.235 per common share payable  January 20, 1998 to  shareowners of record on December 31, 1997. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.50722 per share on the Company's 8.3% Series A Preferred  Stock for the partial  quarterly dividend  period of October 3, 1997 to December 31, 1997, paid December 31, 1997 to shareowners of record on December 19, 1997.    Common  dividends  declared  totaled $0.925 per common share in 1997, of which $0.324  represented  return of capital and $0.601  represented  ordinary income, compared to dividends declared in 1996 of $0.89 per common share, of which $0.41 represented  return of capital and $0.48  represented  ordinary income.  The tax status of total 1998 common  dividends  declared  and to be  declared,  assuming continuation of a $0.235 per common share quarterly dividend, is estimated to be approximately  45% return of capital,  and approximately 55% of ordinary income. Preferred  dividends  declared were $0.50722 per preferred share in 1997, all of which represented  ordinary income. The tax status of total 1998 dividends to be paid on Series A Preferred Stock is estimated to be 100% ordinary income.  These are  forward-looking  statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual  results to differ  materially,  including:  1) the  amount of  dividends declared; 2) changes in the Company's share of anticipated taxable income of TRG due to the  actual  results of TRG;  3)  changes in the number of the  Company's outstanding  shares;  4) property  acquisitions  or  dispositions;  5) financing transactions,  including  refinancing  of existing  debt;  and 6) changes in the Internal Revenue Code or its application.                                          31      TRG    As of December  31,  1997,  TRG had a cash  balance of $3.3  million.  TRG has available  for  general  partnership  purposes  an  unsecured  revolving  credit facility of $300 million,  which  expires in March 2000.  Included in the credit facility is a competitive  bid option program which allows TRG to hold auctions, among the banks  participating in the facility,  for short term borrowings of up to $150 million.  Borrowings  under this facility at December 31, 1997 were $210 million.  TRG also has  available an unsecured  bank line of credit of up to $30 million with borrowings of $10.2 million at December 31, 1997. This line expires in August 1998. TRG also has available a secured commercial paper facility of up to $75 million,  with borrowings of $75 million at December 31, 1997. Commercial paper is generally sold with a 30 day maturity.  This facility is supported by a line of credit facility, which is renewable quarterly for a twelve month period.    Proceeds from short term  borrowings  provided  $487.3  million of funding for 1997  (including   $358.2  million,   including   transaction   costs,  for  the acquisitions  of Regency  Square,  The Falls and  interests in Tuttle  Crossing) compared  to  $121.2  million  in  1996   (including   $103.6  million  for  the acquisitions  of Paseo  Nuevo and an  interest  in  Fairlane  Town  Center).  In November 1997, proceeds from TRG's revolving credit facilities were also used to repay $100 million of floating rate notes.  Additionally,  proceeds in both 1997 and 1996 were used to fund capital expenditures for the Consolidated  Businesses and contributions to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for construction costs.    In October  1997,  TRG used the net proceeds from the issuance of its Series A Preferred  Equity to pay down floating rate debt under TRG's existing  revolving credit and commercial paper facilities,  which were used to fund the acquisition of Regency  Square.  During  1996,  proceeds  from the  issuance of TRG units of partnership  interest  were used to pay down  short  term  borrowings  of $124.7 million and for the $22.3 million acquisition of La Cumbre.    TRG has a medium-term note program under TRG's $500 million shelf registration statement.  During July 1997, TRG issued $55 million of unsecured  10-year notes at a coupon rate of 7%. The net  proceeds  were used to pay down  floating  rate debt under TRG's  revolving  credit  facilities.  In 1996, TRG used the proceeds from the issuance of $154 million of notes to pay down  floating rate debt under TRG's  revolving  credit  facilities  as well as to pay  off the  $34.6  million mortgage on Fairlane and the related  prepayment  penalty of approximately  $1.2 million.  Including  the  issuance in July 1997,  TRG has issued a total of $342 million of notes since the program's inception in 1995.    In October 1997, TRG closed on a three year $150 million secured  construction facility  for  MacArthur  Center,  which is owned by a  consolidated  70%  owned venture. The loan bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 1.2%.  Borrowings under the  facility  were $42.2  million at  December  31,  1997.  The  payment of the principal and interest is guaranteed by TRG. The loan agreement provides for the reduction of the amount  guaranteed as certain center  performance and valuation criteria are met.    In November  1997,  TRG entered  into an unsecured  $210 million  construction facility  maturing in 2001 to finance the  construction of Great Lakes Crossing. Under the loan  agreement,  the maturity date may be extended for one year.  The loan bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 0.90%. Borrowings under the facility at December 31, 1997 were $46.9 million.    Scheduled  principal payments on installment notes were $838 thousand and $793 thousand in 1997 and 1996, respectively.                                          32        At December 31, 1997,  TRG's debt and its  beneficial  interest in the debt of its consolidated and Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures totaled $1,737.2 million. As shown in the following table,  $79.8 million of this debt was floating rate debt that remained unhedged at December 31, 1997. Interest rates shown do not include amortization of debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs. These items are  reported  as  interest  expense  in TRG's  results  of  operations.  In the aggregate,  these costs accounted for 0.36% of the effective rate of interest in TRG's  beneficial  interest  in debt at  December  31,  1997.  Included in TRG's beneficial  interest  in  debt  at  December  31,  1997  is  debt  used  to fund development and expansion costs.  TRG's  beneficial  interest in assets on which interest is being  capitalized  totaled  $149.0 million as of December 31, 1997. TRG's beneficial interest in capitalized interest was $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.

TRG's loan and facility  agreements and indenture contain various  restrictive covenants including  limitations on the amount of secured and unsecured debt and minimum debt service coverage ratios, the latter being the most restrictive. TRG is in compliance with all of such covenants.    Subsequent    to   year   end,    Fairfax    Company   of   Virginia    L.L.C. (successor-in-interest  to Fairfax Associates,  a 50% owned Unconsolidated Joint Venture)  completed a $140 million,  6.60%,  secured financing maturing in 2008. The net proceeds were used to  extinguish  an existing  mortgage on Fair Oaks of approximately  $39 million and pay a prepayment  penalty of  approximately  $1.8 million. In addition, proceeds of $5.6 million were used to close out a treasury lock agreement  entered into in 1997, which resulted in an effective rate on the financing of  approximately  7%. The remaining  proceeds were distributed to the owners.  TRG used its 50% share of the  distribution  to pay down its  revolving credit facilities.                                          33    Distributions    A  principal  factor  considered  by TRG in  deciding  upon  distributions  to partners is an amount,  which TRG defines as  Distributable  Cash Flow, equal to EBITDA less TRG's Beneficial Interest Expense,  non-real estate depreciation and amortization,  and  preferred  distributions.  This  measure of  performance  is influenced  not only by  operations  but also by  capital  structure.  EBITDA is defined as TRG's  beneficial  interest in revenues,  less operating costs before interest,  depreciation and  amortization,  meaning TRG's pro rata share of this result  for  each  of  the  Managed  Businesses,   after  recording  appropriate intercompany eliminations. TRG's Beneficial Interest Expense is defined as TRG's pro rata  share of the  interest  expense of each of TRG's  Managed  Businesses. Funds from Operations is calculated by adding the Company's  beneficial interest in  TRG's  Distributable  Cash  Flow to the  Company's  other  income,  less the Company's  operating  expenses.  EBITDA,  Distributable Cash Flow and Funds from Operations do not represent cash flows from operations,  as defined by generally accepted  accounting  principles,   and  should  not  be  considered  to  be  an alternative  to net income as an indicator of operating  performance  or to cash flows  from  operations  as  a  measure  of  liquidity.  However,  the  National Association of Real Estate  Investment  Trusts (NAREIT) suggests that Funds from Operations is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs.    The following table summarizes TRG's Distributable Cash Flow and the Company's Funds from Operations for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996:                                                     Year ended                               Year ended                                               December 31, 1997                       December 31, 1996                                     --------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------                                               TRG   UNCONSOLIDATED                     TRG   UNCONSOLIDATED                                      CONSOLIDATED            JOINT            CONSOLIDATED            JOINT                                        BUSINESSES      VENTURES(1)   TOTAL      BUSINESSES      VENTURES(1)   TOTAL                                     --------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------                                                                 (in millions of dollars)              TRG's Net Income (2)(3)                                               95.3                                     82.8 Extraordinary item (3)                                                                                          1.3 Depreciation and amortization (4)                                     57.5                                     47.5 TRG's Beneficial Interest Expense                                    102.9                                     98.2                                                                      -----                                    ----- EBITDA                                      161.4          94.4      255.7           138.6          91.2      229.8 TRG's Beneficial Interest Expense           (73.6)        (29.3)    (102.9)          (70.5)        (27.7)     (98.2) Non-real estate depreciation                 (2.1)                    (2.1)           (1.9)                   (1.9) Preferred distributions to TCO               (4.1)                    (4.1)                                             -----         -----      -----           -----         -----      ----- Distributable Cash Flow                      81.6          65.1      146.7            66.2          63.5      129.7                                             =====         =====      =====           =====         =====      =====  TCO's share of Distributable Cash Flow                              53.8                                       44.7 Other income/expenses, net                                          (0.7)                                      (0.6)                                                                    -----                                      ----- Funds from Operations                                               53.1                                       44.1                                                                    =====                                      =====  (1)  Amounts  represent  TRG's  beneficial  interest  in the  operations  of its      Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.

(3)  Extraordinary  charge  related  to the  extinguishment  of debt,  primarily      consisting of a prepayment penalty. (4)  Includes  $3.7  million  and $3.3  million of  amortization  of mall tenant      allowances in 1997 and 1996, respectively. (5)  Amounts may not add due to rounding.     For 1997,  EBITDA and  Distributable  Cash Flow were $255.7 million and $146.7 million,  compared to $229.8  million and $129.7 million in 1996. In addition to $4.1 million representing preferred distributions to the Company on TRG's Series A Preferred  Equity,  TRG  distributed  $128.1  million to its partners in 1997, compared to $119.1 million in 1996. The Company's Funds from Operations for 1997 was $53.1 million, compared to $44.1 million in 1996.    The Partnership  Committee of TRG makes an annual determination of appropriate distributions   for  each  year.  The  determination  is  based  on  anticipated Distributable  Cash Flow available after preferred  distributions to the Company on TRG's Series A Preferred Equity, as well as financing considerations and such other factors as the Partnership Committee considers  appropriate.  Further, the Partnership  Committee has decided that the growth in distributions will be less than the growth in Distributable Cash Flow for the immediate future.                                          34       Except under unusual  circumstances,  TRG's  practice is to  distribute  equal monthly  installments of the determined  amount of distributions  throughout the year.  Due  to  seasonality  and  the  fact  that  cash  available  to  TRG  for distributions  may be  more  or less  than  net  cash  provided  from  operating activities  plus  distributions  from Joint  Ventures  during the year,  TRG may borrow  from  unused  credit  facilities  (described  in  Liquidity  and Capital Resources -- TRG above) to enable it to  distribute  the amount  decided upon by the TRG Partnership Committee.    Distributions  by each Joint Venture may be made only in  accordance  with the terms of its  partnership  agreement.  TRG,  in  general,  acts as the  managing partner  and has the  right  to  determine  the  amount  of cash  available  for distribution  from the  Joint  Venture.  In  general,  the  provisions  of these agreements  require the  distribution  of all available cash (as defined in each partnership agreement), but most do not allow borrowing to finance distributions without approval of the Joint Venture Partner.    As a result,  distribution  policies of many Joint  Ventures will not parallel those of TRG.  While TRG may not,  therefore,  receive as much in  distributions from each Joint Venture as it intends to  distribute  with respect to that Joint Venture,   the  Company  does  not  believe  this  will  impede  TRG's  intended distribution  policy  because  of TRG's  overall  access  to  liquid  resources, including borrowing capacity.    Any inability of TRG or its Joint Ventures to secure  financing as required to fund  maturing  debts,  capital  expenditures  and  changes in working  capital, including development activities and expansions,  may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such  obligations,  thereby possibly  reducing  distributions to partners of TRG and funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends.    In  addition,  if the GM Trusts  exercise  their  rights under the Cash Tender Agreement (see Liquidity and Capital  Resources -- Cash Tender Agreement below), TRG will be  required  to pay the GM  Trusts  $10.9  million  and may  borrow to finance such expenditures.  Capital Spending    Capital  spending for routine  maintenance of the Taubman  Shopping Centers is generally recovered from tenants.  Excluding  acquisitions,  capital spending by the Managed Businesses not recovered from tenants is summarized in the following table:                                                      1997                             ----------------------------------------------------                                                                TRG's Share of                                          Unconsolidated  Consolidated Businesses                             Consolidated          Joint     and Unconsolidated                               Businesses    Ventures(1)    Joint Ventures(1)(2)                             ----------------------------------------------------                                          (in millions of dollars)  Development, renovation,  and expansion:   Existing centers                  12.1           52.8             46.5   New centers                      110.8          134.3            140.7 Pre-construction development  activities, net of charge to  operations                         11.5                            11.5 Mall tenant allowances               5.3            4.0              7.5 Corporate office improvements  and equipment                       2.9                             2.9 Other                                0.8            0.5              1.1                                    -----          -----            ----- Total                              143.4          191.6            210.2                                    =====          =====            =====  (1)  Costs are net of intercompany profits.

(2)  Includes TRG's share of construction costs for Great Lakes Crossing (an 80%      owned  consolidated  joint  venture)  and  MacArthur  Center  (a 70%  owned      consolidated joint venture).    In 1997 and 1996, TRG's share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased during the year,  excluding expansion space and new developments,  was $8.34 and $9.96,  respectively.  In addition,  TRG's share of its Consolidated Businesses' and  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures'  capitalized  leasing costs,  excluding new developments,  was $10.9  million,  or $10.72 per square foot leased  during the year in 1997,  and $8.5 million or $10.47 per square foot leased during the year in 1996.    At Cherry Creek,  an ongoing  expansion  includes a newly  constructed  Lord & Taylor store,  which opened in November  1997,  and the addition of 132 thousand square feet of mall GLA,  which will open in the fall of 1998.  The expansion is expected to cost approximately $50 million.  TRG has a 50% ownership interest in Cherry Creek.    Great Lakes Crossing, an enclosed value super-regional mall being developed by TRG in Auburn Hills,  Michigan, is expected to open in November 1998. The Center will be 1.4 million  square feet and its anchors will include Off 5th-Saks Fifth Avenue Outlet,  Oshman's  Supersports  USA,  Rainforest  Cafe,  Jeepers!,  and a 25-screen 100,000 square foot Star Theater complex. This Center will be owned by a joint venture in which TRG has a controlling  80% interest and is projected to cost approximately $210 million.    MacArthur  Center, a new Center under  construction in Norfolk,  Virginia,  is expected to open in March 1999. The Center is expected to open with 930 thousand square feet and will  initially be anchored by  Nordstrom  and  Dillard's.  This Center  will be owned by a joint  venture  in  which  TRG has a 70%  controlling interest and is projected to cost approximately $150 million.    In 1996,  TRG entered  into an agreement  to lease  Memorial  City Mall, a 1.4 million square foot shopping center located in Houston,  Texas. Memorial City is anchored by Sears, Foley's,  Montgomery Ward and Mervyn's. TRG has the option to terminate  the  lease  after the third  full  year by paying $2  million  to the lessor.   TRG  is  using  this  option  period  to  evaluate  the  redevelopment opportunities  of the  Center.  Under the terms of the lease,  TRG has agreed to invest a minimum of $3  million  during the three  year  option  period.  If the redevelopment  proceeds,  TRG is required to invest an additional $22 million in property  expenditures not recoverable from tenants during the first 10 years of the lease term.                                          36        Assuming no acquisitions,  planned capital spending by the Managed  Businesses not recovered from tenants for 1998 is summarized in the following table:                                                      1998                             ----------------------------------------------------                                                                TRG's Share of                                          Unconsolidated  Consolidated Businesses                             Consolidated          Joint     and Unconsolidated                               Businesses    Ventures(1)    Joint Ventures(1)(2)                             ----------------------------------------------------                                          (in millions of dollars) Development, renovation, and  expansion                         240.9(3)       39.0(4)           208.4 Mall tenant allowances               4.6           9.0                9.6 Pre-construction development   and other                         22.1           1.4               22.8                                    -----         -----              ----- Total                              267.6          49.4              240.8                                    =====         =====              =====  (1)  Costs are net of intercompany profits.

(3)  Includes costs related to MacArthur Center and Great Lakes Crossing. (4)  Includes costs related to the expansion project at Cherry Creek.    TRG's share of costs for  development  projects  scheduled  to be completed in 1999 is  anticipated  to be as much as $58 million in 1999.  TRG's  estimates of 1998  and  1999  capital  spending  include  only  projects  approved  by  TRG's Partnership  Committee  and,  consequently,  TRG's  estimates will change as new projects  are  approved.  Currently,  TRG  expects to open on  average  one $175 million to $200 million  shopping center each year.  TRG's  estimates  regarding capital expenditures presented above are forward-looking  statements and certain significant  factors  could  cause the  actual  results  to  differ  materially, including but not limited to: 1) actual  results of  negotiations  with anchors, tenants and contractors; 2) changes in the scope and number of projects; 3) cost overruns; 4) timing of expenditures; and 5) actual time to complete projects.  Capital Resources    TRG believes that its net cash provided by operating activities, distributions from the Joint Ventures,  the unutilized portion of its credit  facilities,  and its ability to access the credit  markets assure  adequate  liquidity to conduct its operations in accordance with its distribution and financing policies. TRG's borrowings are not and will not be recourse to the Company without its consent.  Cash Tender Agreement    A. Alfred  Taubman  and the GM Trusts each have the annual  right to tender to the Company units of  partnership  interest in TRG (provided  that the aggregate value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender Agreement).  The Company  will have the option to pay for these  interests  from available  cash,  borrowed  funds,  or from the  proceeds  of an offering of the Company's  common  stock.  Generally,  the  Company  expects  to  finance  these purchases  through the sale of new shares of its stock.  The tendering  partners will  bear all  market  risk if the  market  price at  closing  is less than the purchase  price.  Any proceeds of the  offering in excess of the purchase  price will be for the sole benefit of the Company.  At A. Alfred  Taubman's  election, his family, and Robert C. Larson and his family may participate in tenders.  The GM Trusts will be entitled  to receive  from TRG an amount (not to exceed  $10.9 million in the aggregate over the term of the Partnership)  equal to 5.5% of the amounts that the Company pays to the GM Trusts under the Cash Tender Agreement.    Based on a market  value at  December  31, 1997 and 1996 of $13.00 and $12.875 per common share,  the aggregate  value of interests in TRG that may be tendered under the Cash Tender Agreement was approximately $960 million and $954 million, respectively.  Purchase  of these  interests  at  December  31,  1997 would have resulted in the Company owning an additional 53% interest in TRG.    The Company is not aware of any present  intention  of any partner to sell its interest in TRG under the Cash Tender Agreement.                                          37      Item 8.
