Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.           MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements represent the Companys expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including the following: statements regarding future developments and joint ventures, rents and returns, statements regarding the continuation of trends, and any statements regarding the sufficiency of the Companys cash balances and cash generated from operating and financing activities for the Companys future liquidity and capital resource needs. The Company cautions that although forward-looking statements reflect the Companys good faith beliefs and best judgment based upon current information, these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those risks, uncertainties, and factors detailed from time to time in reports filed with the SEC, and in particular those set forth under the headings General Risks of the Company and Environmental Matters in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Taubman Centers, Inc. and the Notes thereto.      General Background and Performance Measurement                The Company owns a managing general partners interest in The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership or TRG), through which the Company conducts all of its operations. The Operating Partnership owns, develops, acquires, and operates regional shopping centers nationally. The Consolidated Businesses consist of shopping centers that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreement, development projects for future regional shopping centers, and The Taubman Company LLC (the Manager). Shopping centers that are not controlled and that are owned through joint ventures with third parties (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.             The operations of the shopping centers are best understood by measuring their performance as a whole, without regard to the Companys ownership interest. Consequently, in addition to the discussion of the operations of the Consolidated Businesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented and discussed as a whole.             The Company opened one new shopping center during 2002 and four new shopping centers during 2001 (Results of Operations  New Center Openings). During 2002, the Company acquired an interest in Sunvalley and sold its interests in La Cumbre Plaza and Paseo Nuevo (Results of Operations  Acquisitions and Dispositions). Additional statistics that exclude the new centers, Sunvalley, La Cumbre Plaza, and Paseo Nuevo are provided to present the performance of comparable centers in the Companys continuing operations.      Current Operating Trends                In 2001 and 2002, the regional shopping center industry has been affected by the softening of the national economy. Economic pressures that affect consumer confidence, job growth, energy costs, and income gains can affect retail sales growth and impact the Companys ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates. The impact of a soft economy on the Companys current results of operations can be moderated by lease cancellation income, which tends to increase in down-cycles of the economy. While the Companys operating statistics have recently shown some improvement, the sales environment remains challenging and, given the very real geopolitical risks, there is no assurance that these trends will continue.    19             Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues              Over the long term, the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately 90% of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent, percentage rent, and recoverable expenses (together, total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However, levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs.             The Company believes that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot.             The following table summarizes occupancy costs, excluding utilities, for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales.                               2002           2001           2000            Mall tenant sales (in thousands)      $3,113,620         $2,797,867         $2,717,195          Sales per square foot      456         463    (1)    466                                        Minimum rents      10.6    %    10.0    %    9.7    %     Percentage rents      0.2       0.2       0.3        Expense recoveries      5.0         4.5         4.4          Mall tenant occupancy costs      15.8    % (2)    14.7    % (2)    14.4    %                                      (1)               2001 sales per square foot has been restated to exclude Paseo Nuevo and La           Cumbre Plaza.            (2)    For shopping centers that have been owned and open for at           least two years, mall tenant occupancy costs             as a percentage of sales were 15.4% and 14.9% for 2002 and 2001, respectively.             Tenant sales per square foot in 2002 decreased by 1.5% compared to 2001. Sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay. The effects of declines in sales experienced during 2001 and 2002 on the Companys operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents (approximately two percent) percentage rents represent. However, if negative sales trends were to continue, the Companys ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates could be adversely affected.      Rental Rates                As leases have expired in the shopping centers, the Company has generally been able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. In a period of increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic. In periods of slower growth or declining sales, such as the Company is currently experiencing, rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason. However, center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases. The following table contains certain information regarding per square foot minimum rent at the shopping centers that have been owned and open for at least two years.                               2002           2001      (1)    2000            Average minimum rent per square foot:          All mall tenants      $41.91       $41.55       $39.77           Stores opening during year      $44.10       $50.46       $46.21           Square feet of GLA opened      814,580         675,952         609,335             Stores closing during year      $42.52       $40.82       $40.06           Square feet of GLA closed      692,790         834,101         628,013                  (1)               2001 rent per square foot information has been restated to exclude Paseo Nuevo           and La Cumbre Plaza.             The opening and closing rents statistics are not computed on comparable tenant spaces, and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount, location, and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period. During 2002, the openings included several large spaces, which typically lease at lower rents.    20                    The following table contains information regarding per square foot minimum rent at shopping centers that have been owned and open for at least two years and excluding tenants greater than 10,000 square feet opening during 2001 or 2002.                             2002           2001            Average minimum rent per square foot:            All mall tenants      $42.40       $41.66             Stores opening during year      $48.62       $54.02             Square feet of GLA opened      619,251         597,108               Stores closing during year (1)      $43.44       $43.67             Square feet of GLA closed      620,377         710,573                    (1)    Excludes spaces greater than 10,000 square feet closed in 2002 or 2001.             Generally, the rent spread between opening and closing stores is in the Companys historic range of $5.00 to $10.00 per square foot. This statistic is difficult to predict in part because of early lease terminations, which may have actual average closing rents per square foot that vary from the average rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations.      Occupancy                Mall tenant average occupancy, ending occupancy, and leased space rates are as follows:                                2002           2001           2000            All Centers            Leased space      90.3    %    87.7    %    93.8    %        Ending occupancy      87.0       84.0       90.5           Average occupancy      84.8       84.9       89.1        Comparable Centers            Leased space      93.4    %    91.6    %    93.7    %        Ending occupancy      90.2       88.6       90.6           Average occupancy      88.3       87.9       89.3                 Occupancy trends showed some improvement in 2002. The lower overall occupancy and leased space in 2002 and 2001 as compared to 2000 reflect the opening of the four centers in 2001 at occupancy levels lower than the average of the existing portfolio. A number of unanticipated early lease terminations and bankruptcies accounted for the majority of the decline in comparable center occupancy in 2001 from 2000. Tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases was 1.7% in 2002, compared to 4.5% in 2001 and 2.3% in 2000.      Seasonality                The regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant, sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and back-to-school events. While minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors, most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter, and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Additionally, most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.                                  1st       2nd       3rd       4th                       Quarter       Quarter       Quarter       Quarter       Total               2002         2002         2002         2002         2002            (in thousands)     Mall tenant sales      $645,317         $669,448         $691,205         $1,107,650         $3,113,620          Revenues      151,307         159,273         170,320         184,172         665,072          Occupancy:            Ending-comparable (1)      86.8    %    87.9    %    89.1    %    90.2    %    90.2    %          Average-comparable (1)      87.2       87.4       88.5       90.0       88.3             Ending      83.3       84.2       85.2       87.0       87.0             Average      83.3       83.7       84.7       86.5       84.8        Leased space:            Comparable (1)      91.5       91.4       92.2       93.4       93.4             All centers      87.4       87.6       88.5       90.3       90.3                 (1)               Excludes centers that opened in 2001 and 2002, La Cumbre Plaza, Paseo Nuevo, and           Sunvalley.    21                    Because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries, mall tenant occupancy costs (the sum of minimum rents, percentage rents, and expense recoveries) relative to sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter.                                 1st       2nd       3rd       4th                       Quarter       Quarter       Quarter       Quarter       Total               2002         2002         2002         2002         2002              Minimum rents         12.1    %    11.9    %    11.9    %    8.1    %    10.6    %     Percentage rents      0.3       0.0       0.0       0.4       0.2        Expense recoveries      5.4       5.7       6.1       3.8       5.0                           Mall tenant occupancy costs      17.8    %    17.6    %    18.0    %    12.3    %    15.8    %                          Results of Operations         New Center Openings                The Mall at Millenia, a 1.1 million square foot regional center in which the Operating Partnership has a 50% interest, opened in October 2002, in Orlando, Florida.             The Mall at Wellington Green, a 1.1 million square foot regional center, opened in October 2001 in Wellington, Florida. A new anchor, Nordstrom, and additional tenant space will open in 2003. The center is owned by a joint venture in which the Operating Partnership has a 90% controlling interest.             International Plaza, a 1.2 million square foot regional center, opened in September 2001 in Tampa, Florida. The Company has an approximately 26% ownership interest in the center and accounts for it under the equity method. The Operating Partnership is entitled to a preferred return on approximately $17 million of equity contributions as of December 2002, which were used to fund construction costs.             The Shops at Willow Bend, a wholly owned 1.3 million square foot regional center, opened in August 2001 in Plano, Texas. A new anchor, Saks Fifth Avenue, will open in September 2004.             Dolphin Mall, a 1.3 million square foot value regional center, opened in March 2001, in Miami, Florida. In October 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Dolphin Mall (see Results of Operations  Acquisitions and Dispositions).      New Center Results                The Mall at Millenia was 96% leased at opening and 93% occupied by December 2002. The center is expected to achieve an approximately 11% return in 2003.             International Plaza and Wellington Green are performing as expected with improving occupancy, leasing progress, and sales performance. The return on Wellington Green was approximately 7% in 2002 and is anticipated to be about 9% in 2003, International Plazas return was approximately 9% in 2002 and is anticipated to be approximately 10% in 2003.             The performance of The Shops at Willow Bend has been adversely affected by local and national economic conditions resulting in lower occupancy and sales levels than expected. In addition, Willow Bend faces significant competition from the large supply of retail space that opened in the area within the last two years. The Company does not expect significant improvements in the fundamentals of Willow Bend until the local economy strengthens.             As a result of Willow Bends current operating performance, a paydown of the construction loan will be required in July 2003, at its first of two, one-year, extension dates. During 2002, the Company paid down $17 million of this facility, principally to take advantage of the lower interest rates under the Companys line of credit. The return on Willow Bend was approximately 6.5% in 2002 and is expected to be slightly lower in 2003.             While the performance of Dolphin Mall was adversely affected by slower than expected lease up, rental concessions and lower than expected expense recoveries, Dolphins performance is continuing to improve. Vehicle counts are averaging about 500,000 per month and sales at the center are increasing steadily. Tenant collections have also increased, and the leasing environment has improved.    22                    Dolphin Mall is subject to annual special tax assessments by a local community development district (CDD) for certain infrastructure improvements on the property. In the first quarter of 2002, the CDD refinanced its outstanding bonds to extend the term from 20 years to 30 years and to reduce the interest rate. In addition, the first annual assessment began in 2002 rather than in 2001, resulting in a reversal of $2.8 million previously expensed. The annual assessments will be based on allocations of the cost of the infrastructure between the properties that benefit. The total allocation of cost to Dolphin Mall based on current assessments is approximately $65.1 million with a 2002 assessment of approximately $3 million. A portion of these assessments is expected to be recovered from tenants.             The Companys return on Dolphin Mall, excluding the favorable $2.8 million reversal described above, was approximately 5% in 2002, and is expected to be approximately 6% in 2003. Considering the opportunities for growth, the Company anticipates that the net operating income of Dolphin Mall will double over the next three to five years, which would result in a return of 11% to 12% on the Companys $97 million incremental investment in Dolphin (Results of Operations-Acquisitions and Dispositions).             Estimates regarding returns are forward-looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to: (1) actual results of negotiations with tenants, (2) timing of tenant openings, (3) early lease terminations and bankruptcies, (4) sales performance of the centers, and (5) increases in operating costs.      Acquisitions and Dispositions                In October 2002, the Company acquired Swerdlow Real Estate Groups (Swerdlows) 50% interest in Dolphin Mall, bringing its ownership in the shopping center to 100%. The $97 million purchase price consisted of $94.5 million of debt that encumbered the property and $2.3 million of peripheral property. No cash was exchanged. Concurrently, all lawsuits between the Company and Swerdlow were settled and Swerdlow repaid the $10 million principal balance of a note due the Company that was previously delinquent. The results of Dolphin have been consolidated in the Companys results subsequent to the acquisition date (prior to that date, Dolphin was accounted for under the equity method as an Unconsolidated Joint Venture).             In May 2002, the Company acquired a 50% general partnership interest in SunValley Associates, a California general partnership that owns the Sunvalley shopping center located in Concord, California, for $88 million. The purchase price consisted of $28 million of cash and $60 million of existing debt that encumbered the property. The center is also subject to a ground lease that expires in 2061. The Manager has managed the property since its development and is continuing to do so after the acquisition. Although the Company purchased its interest in Sunvalley from an unrelated third party, the other 50% partner in the property is an entity owned and controlled by Mr. A. Alfred Taubman, effectively the Companys largest shareholder.             Also in May 2002, the Company purchased an additional 13% interest in Arizona Mills for approximately $14 million in cash plus an additional $19 million share of the debt that encumbers the property. The Company has a 50% interest in the center as of the purchase date.             In March 2002, the Company sold its interest in La Cumbre Plaza for $28 million. In May 2002, the Company sold its interest in Paseo Nuevo for $48 million. The centers were subject to ground leases and unencumbered by debt. The centers were purchased in 1996 for a total of $59 million. The Companys $2.3 million and $10.0 million gains on the sale of La Cumbre Plaza and Paseo Nuevo, respectively, differed from the $6.4 million and $13.4 million gains recognized by the Operating Partnership due to the Companys $4.1 million and $3.4 million additional bases in La Cumbre Plaza and Paseo Nuevo. The results of Paseo Nuevo and La Cumbre Plaza, including the gains on their disposition, have been presented as discontinued operations in the Companys Statement of Operations for all periods presented.             The Company used the net proceeds from the sales of Paseo Nuevo and La Cumbre Plaza to fund the acquisitions of Sunvalley and Arizona Mills, and to pay down borrowings under the Companys lines of credit.      Debt Transactions                In December 2002, the Company completed a $192 million secured financing on International Plaza, repaying in full the outstanding balance of the construction loan. Also in December 2002, the Company closed on a $135 million secured financing on Sunvalley, which paid off the $110 million senior debt and $10 million mezzanine debt previously encumbering the center. The Company used its $6 million share of the excess proceeds from Sunvalley to pay down existing credit facilities. In October 2002, the Dolphin Mall construction facility was amended, reducing the maximum availability to $165 million and requiring a pay-down of $24 million.    23                    In August 2002, Stamford Town Center extended its $76 million loan to August 2004. Also in August, the Company closed on a $105 million construction loan for Stony Point Fashion Park. In July 2002, the Company completed the refinancing of the Westfarms mortgage.             During October and November 2001, the Company completed an $82.5 million financing secured by Regency Square and closed on a new $275 million line of credit. The net proceeds of these financings were used to pay off $150 million outstanding under loans previously secured by Twelve Oaks Mall and the balance under the expiring revolving credit facility. In May 2001, the Company closed on a $168 million construction loan for The Mall at Wellington Green.      Unsolicited Tender Offer                In the fall of 2002, the Company received an unsolicited proposal from Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG) seeking to acquire control of the Company. The proposal was subsequently revised. Thereafter, a tender offer was commenced by SPG and later joined by a subsidiary of Westfield America Trust (Westfield). The Companys Board of Directors has rejected the proposal and recommended that the Companys shareholders not tender their shares pursuant to SPGs and Westfields tender offer. SPG has filed suit against the Company to enjoin the voting of the Companys Series B Non-participating Convertible Preferred Stock based on a variety of legal theories. The Company believes SPGs claims to be without merit. During 2002, the Company incurred approximately $5.1 million in costs in connection with the unsolicited tender offer and related litigation and expects to continue incurring significant costs until these matters are resolved. The ultimate cost will be dependent upon the outcome and duration of these matters.      Other                The Company owned an approximately 6.8% interest in MerchantWired, LLC, a service company originally created to provide internet and network infrastructure to shopping centers and retailers, which ceased operations in September 2002. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized its $1.8 million and $2.4 million share of MerchantWireds operating losses, respectively. During 2002, the Company invested an additional $4.1 million to satisfy the Companys guarantees of MerchantWireds obligations and recorded a charge to write off its remaining $5.8 million balance of its MerchantWired investment.             The Company has an investment in Fashionmall.com, Inc., an e-commerce company originally organized to market, promote, advertise, and sell fashion apparel and related accessories and products over the internet. In 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded charges of $2.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively, relating to its investment in Fashionmall.com. The Company also received $3.1 million in dividends in 2002. Additionally, the Company recorded an unrealized holding gain of $0.3 million as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) to mark its investment to its $0.4 million market value at December 31, 2002. Fashionmall.com continues to work on alternatives to liquidation of the company. The Company expects that the net carrying value of its investment as of December 31, 2002 will be recovered in 2003.             In October 2001, the Operating Partnership committed to a restructuring of its development operations. A restructuring charge of $2.0 million was recorded primarily representing the cost of certain involuntary terminations of personnel. Pursuant to the restructuring plan, 17 positions were eliminated within the development department.      Derivatives                Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133 and its related amendments and interpretations, which establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. The Company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage exposure to interest rate risks inherent in variable rate debt and refinancings. The Company routinely uses cap, swap, and treasury lock agreements to meet these objectives.             The initial adoption of SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in a reduction to income of approximately $8.4 million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and a reduction to OCI of $0.8 million. These amounts represented the transition adjustments necessary to mark the Companys share of interest rate agreements to fair value as of January 1, 2001.    24                    In addition to the transition adjustment, the following table contains the effect that derivative instruments had on net income during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001:                              2002           2001             (Operating Partnership's share in millions of dollars)     Change in fair value of swap agreement not designated as a hedge         (3.3    )    2.4        Payments under swap agreements      4.5       2.1        Hedge ineffectiveness related to changes in time value of interest rate agreements      0.2       0.4        Adjustment of accumulated other comprehensive income for amounts recognized         in net income      0.8       0.5                  Net reduction to income      2.2       5.4                     Comparable Center Operations                The performance of the Companys portfolio can be measured through comparisons of comparable centers operations. During 2002, revenues (excluding land sales and individual lease cancellations over $500 thousand per center) less operating costs (operating and recoverable expenses) of those centers owned and open for at lease two years increased approximately three percent in comparison to the same centers results in 2001. This growth was primarily due to increases in minimum rents, specialty retail income, and decreases in bad debt expense, partially offset by a decrease in percentage rent. The Company expects that comparable center operations will increase annually by two to three percent. This is a forward-looking statement and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially; refer to the General Risks of the Company in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002.      Other Income                The Company has certain additional sources of income beyond its rental revenues, recoveries from tenants, and revenues from management, leasing, and development services, as summarized in the following table. Shopping center related revenues increased in 2002 primarily due to a full year of the new centers that opened in 2001. The Company expects that the shopping center-related revenues will grow modestly in 2003. While gains on peripheral land sales in 2002 were greater than in the prior year, the Company expects that 2003 gains on land sales will be about $5 million. Interest income in 2002 decreased primarily due to the settlement of the Swerdlow note; the Company expects that 2003 interest income will range between $1 million and $1.5 million. Lease cancellation income is dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and is difficult to predict; prior to 2001, it has averaged between $2 million and $4 million and the Company currently projects to be at the high end of this range in 2003. However, the Company is currently negotiating with several tenants and this amount may be exceeded. Estimates regarding anticipated 2003 other income are forward-looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to: 1) actual results of negotiations with tenants, counterparties, and potential purchasers of peripheral land, and 2) timing of transactions.                                2002           2001           2000             (Operating Partnership's share in millions of dollars)   Shopping center related revenues         15.8       12.5       12.2        Gains on peripheral land sales      7.6       4.6       9.1        Lease cancellation revenue      7.6       10.1       1.6        Interest income      1.5       4.7       4.1                            32.5       31.9       27.0                       Insurance                The tragic events of September 11, 2001 had an impact on the Companys insurance coverage. The Company had coverage for terrorist acts in its policies that expired in April 2002. However, such coverage was excluded from its standard property policies at renewal. The Company obtained a separate policy although with lower limits than the prior coverage for terrorist acts.             In November 2002, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002", which required insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage to all existing insured companies for an additional cost. As a result, the Companys insurance coverage is now provided without a sub-limit for terrorism in its standard property policy, just as it was prior to April 2002, eliminating the need for separate terrorism insurance policies.    25             Subsequent Events                In February 2003, the Gordon Group committed to invest $50 million in the Operating Partnership in exchange for 2.08 million partnership units at $24 per unit. These operating partnership units will have the same attributes as existing partnership units, except that they will not have voting rights and will have very limited resale rights for a specified period of time. The Gordon Groups investment is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2003.             In February 2003, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the expansion of the existing buyback program to repurchase up to an additional $100 million of the Companys common shares. The Company plans to repurchase shares from time to time depending on market prices and other conditions. The Company had $3 million remaining under its existing buyback program. Repurchases of common stock would be financed through general corporate funds, including funds anticipated to be received from the Gordon Groups investment, and/or through borrowings under existing lines of credit.             In February 2003, the Company completed a $151 million, 10-year fixed-rate non-recourse refinancing of the current $144 million loan on Great Lakes Crossing at an all-in rate of 5.3%. The Company used excess proceeds of $6.2 million to pay down lines of credit.             In March 2003, the Company acquired the 15% minority interest in Great Lakes Crossing for $3.2 million in cash.      Application of Critical Accounting Policies                The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures. Some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgment, often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. The Company is required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies.      Valuation of Shopping Centers                All properties, including those under construction and/or owned by joint ventures, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment would be recognized when the sum of expected cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying value of the property. The expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change, including (1) changes in the national, regional, and/or local economic climates, (2) competition from other shopping centers, stores, clubs, mailings, and the internet, (3) increases in operating costs, and (4) bankruptcy and/or other changes in the condition of third parties, including anchors and tenants. These factors could cause the Companys expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change, and, as a result, an impairment could be considered to have occurred. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the excess carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value is charged against operations. There were no impairment charges recognized in the periods covered within this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2002, the consolidated net book value of the Companys properties was $2.1 billion, over 90% of the Companys consolidated assets; the Company also has varying ownership percentages in the properties of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures with a total combined net book value of $1.0 billion. These amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows.      Capitalization of Development Costs                In developing shopping centers, the Company typically obtains land or land options, zoning and regulatory approvals, anchor commitments, and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which the Company may incur significant costs. The Company capitalizes all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion. Prior to this time, the Company expenses all costs relating to a potential development, including payroll, and includes these costs in its Funds from Operations.    26                    Many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond the control of the Company, including (1) changes in the national, regional, and/or local economic climates, (2) competition from other shopping centers, stores, clubs, mailing, and the internet, (3) availability and cost of financing, (4) changes in regulation, laws, and zoning, and (5) decisions made by third parties, including anchors. These factors could cause the Companys assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change. If a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion, a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur.             The Companys $29.9 million balance of development pre-construction costs as December 31, 2002 consists primarily of costs related to a project in Syosset, New York. Both Neiman Marcus and Lord & Taylor have made announcements committing to the project. Although the Company still needs to obtain a special use permit and site plan approval from the Oyster Bay Town Board to move forward with the project, the Company is encouraged that the Appellate Court has recently affirmed the New York State Supreme Courts decision to annul the unfavorable zoning actions of the Oyster Bay Town Board. While the Company expects to be successful in this effort, the process may still not be resolved in the near future. In addition, if the litigation is unsuccessful, the Company expects to consider its alternatives, including possible other uses for the site, but may ultimately decide to abandon the project.      Valuation of Accounts Receivable                Rents and expense recoveries from tenants are the Companys principal source of income; they represent over 90% of the Companys revenues. In generating this income, the Company will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. The collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies, changes in the economy, and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements. While the Company estimates potentially uncollectible receivables and provides for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates. Also, if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement, receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations. Bad debt expense was approximately 1% of total revenues in 2002, while bankruptcy filings affected 1.7% of tenant leases during the year.      New Accounting Pronouncements                In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This Interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities and the conditions under which they should be included in consolidated financial statements. The Company does not believe that Interpretation No. 46 will change the entities which the Company currently consolidates in its financial statements.             In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123". This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has determined that it will apply the prospective method of implementing SFAS No. 148, and apply its recognition provisions to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after January 1, 2003. There were no employee awards granted, modified, or settled in 2002.             In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others . Interpretation No. 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. Interpretation No. 45 would require the recognition of an obligation by the Company for a guarantee of debt of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures issued after December 31, 2002; the Company does not have any present intentions of issuing any such guarantee. The disclosure requirements of Interpretation No. 45 were effective for the 2002 financial statements and applied to the Companys guarantee of the debt of The Mall at Millenia.    27                    In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, with earlier adoption encouraged. SFAS No. 146 would affect the timing of recognition costs of any exit or disposal activities. However, the Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 146 will otherwise have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.             In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS 13, and Technical Corrections, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. SFAS 145 rescinds SFAS 4, SFAS 44 and SFAS 64 and amends SFAS 13 to modify the accounting for sale-leaseback transactions. SFAS 4 required the classification of gains and losses resulting from extinguishment of debt to be classified as extraordinary items. Such gains and losses will now be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the requirements of APB 30 as being both unusual and infrequent. The Company expects to reclassify extraordinary losses of $9.5 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, from extraordinary items upon adoption of SFAS 145 on January 1, 2003.      Presentation of Operating Results                The following tables contain the combined operating results of the Companys Consolidated Businesses and the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Income allocated to the minority partners in the Operating Partnership and preferred interests is deducted to arrive at the results allocable to the Companys common shareowners. Because the net equity of the Operating Partnership is less than zero, the income allocated to the minority partners is equal to their share of distributions. The net equity of these minority partners is less than zero due to accumulated distributions in excess of net income and not as a result of operating losses. Distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization, although distributions were less than net income during 2000 due to the gain on the disposition of Lakeside. Also, losses allocable to minority partners in certain consolidated joint ventures are added back to arrive at the net results of the Company. The Companys average ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership was 62% in both 2002 and 2001, and 63% in 2000.             The operating results in the following tables include the supplemental earnings measures of EBITDA and Funds from Operations (FFO). EBITDA represents earnings before interest and depreciation and amortization, excluding gains on dispositions of depreciated operating properties. FFO is defined as income before extraordinary items, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, real estate depreciation and amortization, and the allocation to the minority interest in the Operating Partnership, less preferred dividends and distributions. Gains on dispositions of depreciated operating properties are excluded from FFO.             FFO is used by the Company in measuring performance, determining the amount of dividends payable to shareowners, and in formulating corporate goals and compensation. Funds from Operations does not represent cash flows from operations, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles, and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. However, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts suggests that Funds from Operations is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs. Funds from Operations as presented by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.             In 2002, an $8.1 million charge related to technology investments and $5.1 million of costs related to the unsolicited tender offer were excluded from EBITDA and FFO and in 2001 a $1.9 million charge related to a technology investment was also excluded.    28             Comparison of 2002 to 2001            The following table sets forth operating results for 2002 and 2001, showing the results of the Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:                                  2002       2001                                CONSOLIDATED BUSINESSES         UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100% (1)         TOTAL OF CONSOLIDATED  BUSINESSES AND UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100%         CONSOLIDATED BUSINESSES         UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100% (1)         TOTAL OF CONSOLIDATED  BUSINESSES AND UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100%                             (in millions of dollars)      REVENUES:                                                            Minimum rents      196.4       185.2       381.6       167.1       149.3       316.5          Percentage rents      4.8       3.5       8.2       5.2       3.2       8.4          Expense recoveries      119.6       94.2       213.8       100.2       73.6       173.8          Management, leasing and development      22.7             22.7       26.0             26.0          Other      29.5       9.2       38.7       27.4       12.3       39.7                              Total revenues      373.0       292.1       665.1       326.0       238.4       564.4                OPERATING COSTS:         Recoverable expenses      105.6       81.6       187.2       87.2       67.3       154.5          Other operating      33.8       23.1       56.9       32.5       15.1       47.5          Restructuring loss                        2.0             2.0          Charge related to technology           investments      8.1             8.1       1.9             1.9          Costs related to unsolicited tender           offer      5.1             5.1          Management, leasing and development      20.0             20.0       19.0             19.0          General and administrative      20.6             20.6       20.1             20.1          Interest expense      83.7       77.0       160.7       68.2       75.0       143.1          Depreciation and amortization(2)      83.1       57.0       140.1       66.0       39.3       105.3                              Total operating costs      360.1       238.7       598.8       296.8       196.7       493.5                                     12.8       53.4       66.2       29.1       41.8       70.9                                     Equity in income of Unconsolidated         Joint Ventures (2) (3)      27.9                   21.9                        Income before discontinued operations,         cumulative effect of change in         accounting principle, and minority and         preferred  interests      40.8                   51.0                              Discontinued operations:         Gain on dispositions of interests           in centers      12.3          EBITDA      3.2                   7.6          Depreciation and amortization      (0.5    )                (2.9    )     Cumulative effect of change in         accounting principle                        (8.4    )     Minority and preferred interests:         TRG preferred distributions      (9.0    )                (9.0    )       Minority share of consolidated           joint ventures      0.4                   1.1          Minority share of income of TRG      (17.4    )                (11.7    )       Distributions in excess of           minority share of income      (15.4    )                (20.0    )                     Net income      14.4                   7.7        Series A preferred dividends      (16.6    )                (16.6    )                     Net loss allocable to common         shareowners      (2.2    )                (8.9    )                            SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:         EBITDA -

Amounts are net of intercompany transactions. The           Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented at 100% in order to allow for           measurement of their performance as a whole, without regard to the           Companys ownership interest. In its consolidated financial statements, the           Company accounts for its investments in the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures under           the equity method.                (2)      Amortization of the Companys additional basis in the Operating Partnership           included in equity in income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $3.0 million           in both 2002 and 2001. Also, amortization of the additional basis included in           depreciation and amortization was $4.4 million and $4.6 million in 2002 and           2001, respectively.               (3)    Equity in income of           Unconsolidated Joint Ventures excludes the cumulative effect of the change in           accounting principle incurred in connection with the Companys adoption of           SFAS 133. The Companys share of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures          cumulative effect was approximately $1.6 million.               (4)    Amounts in this table may           not add due to rounding.        29             Consolidated Businesses                Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $373.0 million, a $47.0 million or 14.4% increase over 2001. Minimum rents increased $29.3 million, of which $24.6 million was due to the openings of The Shops at Willow Bend and The Mall at Wellington Green and the consolidation of Dolphin Mall after the acquisition of the additional interest. Minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers and increases in occupancy. Expense recoveries increased primarily due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green, and the inclusion of Dolphin Mall. Management, leasing, and development revenue decreased primarily due to the loss of Sunvalley revenue due to its acquisition, and the completion of a short-term contract. Other revenue increased due to increases in gains on sales of peripheral land and income from sponsorship and other retail initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in interest income.             Total operating costs were $360.1 million, a $63.3 million or 21.3% increase over the comparable period in 2001. Recoverable expenses increased primarily due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green, and the inclusion of Dolphin Mall. Other operating expense increased primarily due to the new centers, partially offset by decreases in MerchantWired losses and bad debt expense. During 2001, a $2.0 million restructuring loss was recognized, which primarily represented the cost of certain involuntary terminations of personnel. During 2002, the Company recognized an $8.1 million charge relating to its investments in MerchantWired and Fashionmall.com, while a $1.9 million charge was recognized relating to the invesment in Fashionmall.com in 2001. During 2002, $5.1 million in costs were incurred in connection with the unsolicited tender offer. Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in debt and a decrease in capitalized interest upon opening of Willow Bend and Wellington Green, as well as the change in ownership of Dolphin Mall, partially offset by decreases due to lower rates on floating rate debt and the paydown of debt from the proceeds of the sale of Paseo Nuevo and La Cumbre Plaza. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green, and Dolphin Mall.      Unconsolidated Joint Ventures                Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $292.1 million, a $53.7 million or 22.5% increase from 2001. Minimum rents increased $35.9 million, of which $34.5 million was due to International Plaza, the Mall at Millenia, the acquisition of the interest in Sunvalley, and Dolphin Mall prior to the acquisition of the additional interest. Minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers and increases in occupancy. Expense recoveries increased primarily due to International Plaza, Millenia, and Sunvalley. Other revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in lease cancellation revenue, partially offset by increases in gains on sales of peripheral land and income from sponsorship and other retail initiatives.             Total operating costs increased by $42.0 million to $238.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Recoverable expenses increased primarily due to International Plaza, Millenia, and Sunvalley. Recoverable expenses in 2002 included the reversal of a $2.8 million special assessment tax accrued during 2001. Other operating expense increased primarily due to these new centers and charges for costs of development activities. Interest expense increased due to the Sunvalley acquisition, increased debt (and decreased capitalized interest upon opening) of International Plaza and Millenia, partially offset by a decrease in the liability for the Dolphin Mall swap agreement recorded under FAS 133 and lower rates on floating rate debt. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to International Plaza, Millenia, and Sunvalley.             As a result of the foregoing, income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures increased by $11.6 million to $53.4 million. The Companys equity in income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $27.9 million, a $6.0 million increase from the comparable period in 2001.      Net Income                As a result of the foregoing, the Companys income before discontinued operations, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, and minority and preferred interests decreased $10.2 million to $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The discontinued operations of Paseo Nuevo and La Cumbre Plaza include a $12.3 million gain on the dispositions of these centers in 2002. In 2001, a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $8.4 million was recognized in connection with the Companys adoption of SFAS 133. After allocation of income to minority and preferred interests, the net loss allocable to common shareowners for 2002 was $(2.2) million compared to $(8.9) million in 2001.    30             Comparison of 2001 to 2000                Discussion of significant transactions and openings occurring in 2001 precedes the Comparison of 2002 to 2001. Significant transactions that occurred in 2000 are described below.             In August 2000, the Company completed a transaction to acquire an additional ownership in one of its Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Under the terms of the agreement, the Operating Partnership became the 100% owner of Twelve Oaks Mall and the joint venture partner became the 100% owner of Lakeside, subject to the existing mortgage debt. The transaction resulted in a net payment to the joint venture partner of approximately $25.5 million in cash. The results of Twelve Oaks have been consolidated in the Companys results subsequent to the acquisition date (prior to that date, Twelve Oaks was accounted for under the equity method as an Unconsolidated Joint Venture). A gain of $85.3 million on the transaction was recognized by the Company representing its share of the excess of the fair value over the net book basis of the Companys interest in Lakeside, adjusted for the $25.5 million paid and transaction costs.             During 2000, the Operating Partnership recognized its $9.5 million share of extraordinary charges relating to the Arizona Mills and Stamford Town Center refinancings, which consisted of a prepayment premium and the write-off of deferred financing costs.             In 1996, the Operating Partnership entered into an agreement to lease Memorial City Mall, a 1.4 million square foot shopping center located in Houston, Texas. The lease was subject to certain provisions that enabled the Operating Partnership to explore significant redevelopment opportunities and terminate the lease obligation in the event such redevelopment opportunities were not deemed to be sufficient. The Operating Partnership terminated its Memorial City lease on April 30, 2000.    31             Comparison of 2001 to 2000                The following table sets forth operating results for 2001 and 2000, showing the results of the Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:                                   2001       2000                                CONSOLIDATED BUSINESSES         UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100% (1)         TOTAL OF CONSOLIDATED  BUSINESSES AND UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100%         CONSOLIDATED BUSINESSES (2)         UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100% (1)         TOTAL OF CONSOLIDATED  BUSINESSES AND UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AT 100%                             (in millions of dollars)      REVENUES:                                                            Minimum rents      167.1       149.3       316.5       142.8       145.5       288.3          Percentage rents      5.2       3.2       8.4       6.0       3.8       9.8          Expense recoveries      100.2       73.6       173.8       86.7       75.7       162.4          Management, leasing and development      26.0             26.0       25.0             25.0          Other      27.4       12.3       39.7       25.9       5.7       31.6                              Total revenues      326.0       238.4       564.4       286.3       230.7       517.0               OPERATING COSTS:         Recoverable expenses      87.2       67.3       154.5       75.4       63.6       139.0          Other operating      32.5       15.1       47.5       26.0       13.4       39.4          Restructuring loss      2.0             2.0          Charge related to technology investment      1.9             1.9          Management, leasing and development      19.0         19.0       19.5         19.5          General and administrative      20.1             20.1       19.0             19.0          Interest expense      68.2       75.0       143.1       57.3       65.5       122.8          Depreciation and amortization(3)      66.0       39.3       105.3       54.0       29.5       83.5                              Total operating costs      296.8       196.7       493.5       251.4       172.0       423.6        Net results of Memorial City (2)                        (1.6    )          (1.6    )                                  29.1       41.8       70.9       33.1       58.6       91.7                                     Equity in income before extraordinary         items  of Unconsolidated Joint         Ventures(3)      21.9                   28.5                               Income before gain on disposition,         discontinued operations,         extraordinary items, cumulative effect         of change in accounting principle,         and minority and preferred interests      51.0                   61.7        Gain on disposition of interest in center                        85.3        Discontinued operations:         EBITDA      7.6                   7.4          Depreciation and amortization      (2.9    )                (2.7    )     Extraordinary items                        (9.5    )     Cumulative effect of change in         accounting principle      (8.4    )     Minority and preferred interests:         TRG preferred distributions      (9.0    )                (9.0    )       Minority share of consolidated           joint ventures      1.1          Minority share of income of TRG      (11.7    )                (58.5    )       Distributions less than (in excess of)           minority share of income      (20.0    )                28.2                                Net income      7.7                   103.0        Series A preferred dividends      (16.6    )                (16.6    )                            Net income (loss) allocable to         common shareowners      (8.9    )                86.4                                     SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:         EBITDA - 100%      172.8       156.0       328.8       153.1       153.7       306.8          EBITDA - outside partners' share      (7.5    )    (71.6    )    (79.2    )    (7.6    )    (70.8    )    (78.4    )                             EBITDA contribution      165.3       84.4       249.7       145.6       82.9       228.4          Beneficial interest expense      (63.2    )    (38.7    )    (101.9    )    (52.2    )    (34.9    )    (87.1    )       Non-real estate depreciation      (2.7    )          (2.7    )    (3.0    )          (3.0    )       Preferred dividends and distributions      (25.6    )          (25.6    )    (25.6    )          (25.6    )                             Funds from Operations contribution      73.8       45.7       119.5       64.8       47.9       112.7                                         (1)               With the exception of the Supplemental Information, amounts include 100% of the           Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Amounts are net of intercompany transactions. The           Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented at 100% in order to allow for           measurement of their performance as a whole, without regard to the           Companys ownership interest. In its consolidated financial statements, the           Company accounts for its investments in the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures under           the equity method.             (2)               The results of operations of Memorial City are presented net in this table. The           Operating Partnership terminated its Memorial City lease on April 30, 2000.            (3)               Amortization of the Companys additional basis in the Operating Partnership           included in equity in income before extraordinary items of Unconsolidated Joint           Ventures was $3.0 million and $3.8 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Also,           amortization of the additional basis included in depreciation and amortization           was $4.6 million and $4.2 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.             (4)               Equity in income before extraordinary items of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures           excludes the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle incurred in           connection with the Companys adoption of SFAS 133. The Companys           share of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures cumulative effect was           approximately $1.6 million.             (5)     Amounts in this table may not add due to           rounding.    32             Consolidated Businesses                Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $326.0 million, a $39.7 million or 13.9% increase over 2000. Minimum rents increased $24.3 million of which $23.1 million was due to the openings of The Shops at Willow Bend and The Mall at Wellington Green, as well as the inclusion of Twelve Oaks Mall. Minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers and new sources of rental income, including temporary tenants and advertising space arrangements, offsetting decreases in rent caused by lower occupancy. Percentage rents decreased due to decreases in tenant sales. Expense recoveries increased primarily due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green, and Twelve Oaks. Management, leasing, and development revenues increased primarily due to leasing commissions, including those relating to two short-term leasing contracts. Other revenue increased primarily due to an increase in lease cancellation revenue and interest income, partially offset by a decrease in gains on sales of peripheral land.             Total operating costs were $296.8 million, a $45.4 million or 18.1% increase from 2000. Recoverable expenses increased primarily due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green, and Twelve Oaks. Other operating expense increased due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green, and Twelve Oaks, as well as increases in bad debt expense, marketing expense, professional fees relating to process improvement projects, and losses relating to the investment in MerchantWired, partially offset by a decrease in the charge to operations for costs of pre-development activities. During 2001, a $2.0 million restructuring loss was recognized, which primarily represented the cost of certain involuntary terminations of personnel. The Company also recognized a $1.9 million charge relating to its investment in Fashionmall.com, Inc. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to increases in payroll costs. Interest expense increased primarily due to debt assumed and incurred relating to Twelve Oaks and a decrease in capitalized interest upon opening of the new centers, offset by decreases due to declines in interest rates. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green, and Twelve Oaks.      Unconsolidated Joint Ventures                Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $238.4 million, a $7.7 million or 3.3% increase from the comparable period of 2000. Minimum rents increased primarily due to tenant rollovers and new sources of rental income, including temporary tenants and advertising space arrangements, which offset decreases in rent caused by lower occupancy. Increases in minimum rent due to Dolphin Mall and International Plaza were offset by Twelve Oaks and Lakeside. Expense recoveries decreased primarily due to Twelve Oaks and Lakeside, partially offset by Dolphin Mall and International Plaza. Other revenue increased primarily due to an increase in lease cancellation revenue.             Total operating costs increased by $24.7 million to $196.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Recoverable expenses and depreciation expense increased primarily due to Dolphin Mall and International Plaza, partially offset by Twelve Oaks and Lakeside. Other operating expense increased primarily due to the openings of Dolphin Mall and International Plaza, including greater levels of bad debt expense at Dolphin Mall, partially offset by Twelve Oaks and Lakeside. Interest expense increased due to a decrease in capitalized interest upon opening of Dolphin Mall and International Plaza and changes in the value of Dolphin Malls swap agreement, partially offset by decreases due to Twelve Oaks and Lakeside and declines in interest rates.             As a result of the foregoing, income before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures decreased by $16.8 million, or 28.7%, to $41.8 million. The Companys equity in income before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $21.9 million, a 23.2% decrease from 2000.      Net Income                As a result of the foregoing, the Companys income before gain on disposition of interest in center, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, and minority and preferred interests decreased $10.7 million, or 17.3%, to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. During 2001, a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $8.4 million was recognized in connection with the Companys adoption of SFAS 133. During 2000, the Company recognized an $85.3 million gain on the disposition of its interest in Lakeside, and an extraordinary charge of $9.5 million related to the extinguishment of debt. After allocation of income to minority and preferred interests, net income (loss) allocable to common shareowners for 2001 was $(8.9) million compared to $86.4 million in 2000.    33             Reconciliation of Income to Funds from Operations                                2002           2001               (in millions of dollars)            Income before discontinued operations, cumulative effect         of change in accounting principle, and minority and         preferred interests (1) (2)      40.8       51.0        Add:          Funds from operations of discontinued operations      3.2       7.6           Depreciation and amortization (3)      83.1       66.0           Share of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures'            depreciation and amortization (4)      36.7       23.9           Charge related to technology investments      8.1       1.9           Costs relating to unsolicited tender offer      5.1        Deduct:          Non-real estate depreciation      (2.7    )    (2.7    )        Minority partners in consolidated joint ventures share            of funds from operations      (3.6    )    (2.5    )        Preferred dividends and distributions      (25.6    )    (25.6    )                      Funds from Operations - TRG      145.1       119.5                   Funds from Operations allocable to TCO      89.8       73.5                            (1)                          Includes the Operating Partnerships share of gains on peripheral land                     sales of $7.6 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and                     2001, respectively.

(2)     Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.    34             Liquidity and Capital Resources                In the following discussion, references to beneficial interest represent the Operating Partnerships ownership share of the results of its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. The Company does not have, and has not had, any parent company indebtedness; all debt discussed represents obligations of the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries and joint ventures.             The Company believes that its net cash provided by operating activities, distributions from its joint ventures, the unutilized portion of its credit and construction facilities, and its ability to access the capital markets assure adequate liquidity to conduct its operations in accordance with its dividend and financing policies, and to provide the liquidity to fund the Companys anticipated capital spending on new development, acquisitions and repurchases of stock as discussed below.             As of December 31, 2002, the Company had a consolidated cash balance of $32.5 million. Additionally, the Company has a secured $275 million line of credit. This line had $140 million of borrowings as of December 31, 2002 and expires in November 2004 with a one-year extension option. The Company also has available a second secured bank line of credit of up to $40 million. The line had $8.6 million of borrowings as of December 31, 2002 and expires in November 2004.      Summary of Operating Activities                The Companys net cash provided by operating activities was $141.7 million in 2002, compared to $120.8 million in 2001 and $118.3 million in 2000. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to a full year of operations of the centers that opened in 2001 and an increase in rents and recoveries of the core centers (further discussion of operations and future trends that may affect future operating cash flows is included in Results of Operations).      Summary of Investing Activities                Net cash provided by investing activities was $28.0 million in 2002 compared to $240.7 million used in 2001 and $219.7 million used in 2000. Cash used in investing activities was impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, with additions to properties in 2002, 2001, and 2000 for the construction of Stony Point Fashion Park, The Mall at Wellington Green, and The Shops at Willow Bend, as well as other development activities and other capital items. During 2002, 2001, and 2000, $4.1 million, $4.0 million, and $3.0 million were invested in technology-related ventures, respectively, while a $3.1 million dividend was received from Fashionmall.com in 2002. The Company received net proceeds of $76.4 million from the disposition of La Cumbre Plaza and Paseo Nuevo and invested $42.2 million in acquiring the interests in Sunvalley, Dolphin Mall, and Arizona Mills in 2002. During 2000, net acquisition costs of $23.6 million were incurred in connection with the Lakeside and Twelve Oaks transaction. Net proceeds from sales of peripheral land were $13.3 million, $8.6 million, and $8.2 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Although 2001 gains on land sales were less than those in 2000, net proceeds were higher in 2001 because certain sales in 2000 involved larger land contracts. Contributions to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures were $1.6 million in 2002, $55.9 million in 2001, and $18.8 million in 2000, primarily representing funding for construction activities at Dolphin Mall, International Plaza, and The Mall at Millenia. Distributions from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures in 2002 increased primarily due to International Plaza, Dolphin Mall, Sunvalley, and the Companys $36.8 million share of excess proceeds from the Westfarms refinancing.      Summary of Financing Activities                Net cash used in financing activities was $164.9 million in 2002, compared to $128.8 million of cash provided in 2001, and $99.7 million of cash provided in 2000. Repayments of debt, net of proceeds and issuance costs, were $70.9 million, compared to net borrowings of $242.7 million and $231.2 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Stock repurchases of $22.9 million were made in connection with the Companys stock repurchase program in 2001, a decrease of $1.3 million from 2000. Issuance of stock pursuant to the Continuing Offer related to the exercise of employee options contributed $16.4 million in 2002, $16.9 million in 2001, and $0.1 million in 2000. Total dividends and distributions paid were $110.3 million, $107.9 million, and $107.5 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.    35             Beneficial Interest in Debt                At December 31, 2002, the Operating Partnerships debt and its beneficial interest in the debt of its Consolidated and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures totaled $2,125.4 million with an average interest rate of 5.85% excluding amortization of debt issuance costs and the effects of interest rate hedging instruments. Debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs are reported as interest expense in the results of operations. Amortization of debt issuance costs added 0.33% to TRGs effective interest rate during 2002. Included in beneficial interest in debt is debt used to fund development and expansion costs. Beneficial interest in assets on which interest is being capitalized totaled $124.1 million as of December 31, 2002. Beneficial interest in capitalized interest was $7.9 million for 2002. As provided for by certain debt agreements, the Company has currently locked in LIBOR rates on certain floating rate debt. In addition, the Company has entered into swap agreements to hedge certain floating rate debt. The following table presents information about the Companys beneficial interest in debt as of December 31, 2002 (amounts may not add due to rounding).                                     Amount         Interest Rate Including Spread         LIBOR Lock/ Swap Rate                          (in millions  of dollars)      Fixed rate debt      1,242.2       7.068    % (1)     Floating rate debt:            LIBOR lock through March 2003      121.7       4.590       3.090    %         Swapped through September 2003      100.0       4.350       2.500     (2)          Swapped through October 2003      100.0       5.198       4.298            Swapped through June 2004      100.0       5.975       4.125            Swapped through September 2004      140.0       4.295       2.045    (3)         Floating month to month      321.5       2.952    (1)            Total floating rate debt      883.2       4.146    (1)            Total beneficial interest in debt      2,125.4       5.854    %                       (1)        Represents weighted average rate.                   (2)                          This debt is also swapped from October 2003 through September 2004 at 4.35% and                     from October 2004 through April 2005 at 5.25%.                    (3)                          The notional amount of this swap decreases to $120.0 million on December 1,                     2003.                      In February 2003, the Company completed a $151 million, 10-year fixed-rate non-recourse refinancing of the current $144 million loan on Great Lakes Crossing at an all-in rate of 5.3%.             The Company also expects to refinance the construction loan on The Mall at Millenia in the first half of 2003.             The $146 million loan on Beverly Center will be prepayable without penalty in January 2004. The Company expects that it would be able to refinance the center at a significantly higher amount than the current principal balance.      Sensitivity Analysis                The Company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt obligations and interest rate instruments. Based on the Operating Partnerships beneficial interest in floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2002, excluding debt fixed under long-term LIBOR rate contracts and interest rate swaps, a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates on this floating rate debt would decrease or increase annual cash flows by approximately $4.3 million and, due to the effect of capitalized interest, annual earnings by approximately $4.0 million. Based on the Companys consolidated debt and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2002, a one percent increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $35.4 million, while a one percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $37.7 million.    36             Covenants and Commitments                Certain loan agreements contain various restrictive covenants, including minimum net worth requirements, minimum debt service and fixed charges coverage ratios, a maximum payout ratio on distributions, and a minimum debt yield ratio, the latter being the most restrictive. The Operating Partnership is in compliance with all of its covenants.             Certain debt agreements, including all construction facilities, contain performance and valuation criteria that must be met for the loans to be extended at the full principal amounts; these agreements provide for partial prepayments of debt to facilitate compliance with extension provisions. A prepayment of $24 million of principal was necessary to extend the October 2002 maturity date on the Dolphin Mall construction loan. The Company also paid down the Willow Bend construction loan by $17 million in 2002. The Company expects that an additional payment on the Willow Bend loan will be required at the first extension date in July 2003. The amount of the payment has not been determined, as it is based on leases in place at the time of extension.             Payments of principal and interest on the loans in the following table are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2002. All of the loan agreements provide for a reduction of the amounts guaranteed as certain center performance and valuation criteria are met.

The Company has made a capital commitment of $0.8 million to Constellation, although any additional contributions would be restricted to a maximum of $0.3 million in 2003.             A.           Alfred Taubman has the annual right to tender to the Company units of           partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (provided that the aggregate           value is at least $50 million) and cause the Company to purchase the tendered           interests at a purchase price based on a market valuation of the Company on the           trading date immediately preceding the date of the tender (the Cash Tender           Agreement). At A. Alfred Taubmans election, his family, and certain others           may participate in tenders. The Company will have the option to pay for these           interests from available cash, borrowed funds, or from the proceeds of an           offering of the Companys common stock. Generally, the Company expects to           finance these purchases through the sale of new shares of its stock. The           tendering partner will bear all market risk if the market price at closing is           less than the purchase price and will bear the costs of sale. Any proceeds of           the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of the           Company.             Based on a market value at December 31, 2002 of $16.23 per common share, the aggregate value of interests in the Operating Partnership that may be tendered under the Cash Tender Agreement was approximately $401 million. The purchase of these interests at December 31, 2002 would have resulted in the Company owning an additional 29% interest in the Operating Partnership.    37             Capital Spending            Capital spending for routine maintenance of the shopping centers is generally recovered from tenants. Capital spending during 2002 not recovered from tenants is summarized in the following table:                                                      2002  (1)                      Consolidated Businesses         Unconsolidated Joint Ventures       Beneficial Interest in Consolidated Businesses  and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures               (in millions of dollars)     Development, renovation, and expansion:          Existing centers      4.5       (1.6    )    3.7           New centers      58.6    (2)    115.7     (3)    116.1        Pre-construction development activities,         net of charge to operations      7.9             7.9        Mall tenant allowances (4)      7.7       13.3       14.0        Corporate office improvements, equipment,          and software      2.2             2.2        Other      0.8       0.6       1.0                     Total      81.7       128.0       144.9                                (1)                Costs are net of intercompany profits and are computed on an accrual basis.              (2)                Primarily includes costs related to Stony Point Fashion Park.            (3)      Primarily           includes costs related to The Mall at Millenia (a 50% owned unconsolidated joint           venture).             (4)      Excludes tenant allowances for the centers that opened in 2001 and           2002.              (5)     Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.             For the year ended December 31, 2002, in addition to the costs above, the Company incurred its $7.5 million share of capitalized leasing costs and its $9.4 million share of repair and asset replacement costs that will be reimbursed by tenants. Also during this period, the Companys share of reimbursements by tenants for capitalizable expenditures of prior periods was $8.4 million. The expenditures reimbursable by the tenants and the related reimbursements are classifed as recoverable expenses and expense recoveries, respectively, and both are included in the Companys Funds from Operations.             The following table presents a reconciliation of the Consolidated Businesses capital spending shown above to cash additions to properties as presented in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2002.                                 (in millions of dollars)                  Consolidated Businesses' capital spending not recovered from tenants      81.7        Repair and asset replacement costs reimbursable by tenants      7.1        Repair and asset replacement costs reimbursed by tenants      (6.0    )     Cash payments for capital spending accrued during 2001      20.6               Additions to properties      103.4              38                    Capital spending during 2001 not recovered from tenants is summarized in the following table:                                                    2001  (1)                      Consolidated Businesses         Unconsolidated Joint Ventures       Beneficial Interest in Consolidated Businesses  and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures               (in millions of dollars)        Development, renovation, and expansion:          Existing centers      9.8       11.5       15.4           New centers      238.6    (2)    295.5     (3)    347.3        Pre-construction development activities,         net of charge to operations      6.8             6.8        Mall tenant allowances      11.3       3.7       12.7        Corporate office improvements, equipment,          and software      2.4             2.4        Other      1.0       1.0       1.5                     Total      269.9       311.7       386.1                                (1)                          Costs are net of intercompany profits and are computed on an accrual basis.                     (2)                          Includes costs related to The Mall at Wellington Green (a 90% owned consolidated                     joint venture), The Shops at Willow Bend, and Stony Point Fashion Park.                     (3)                          Includes costs related to International Plaza (a 26% owned unconsolidated joint                     venture), Dolphin Mall (a 50% owned unconsolidated joint venture), and The Mall                     at Millenia (a 50% owned unconsolidated joint venture).                     (4)                          Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.                      The Operating Partnerships share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased during the year, excluding expansion space and new developments, was $18.18 in 2002 and $15.26 in 2001. Excluding leased spaces greater than 10,000 square feet, the mall tenant allowance per square foot leased in 2002 was $15.78. In addition, the Operating Partnerships share of capitalized leasing and tenant coordination costs in 2002, excluding new developments, was $7.5 million, or $9.76 per square foot leased and $8.7 million or $10.32 per square foot leased during the year in 2001.      Planned Capital Spending                Stony Point Fashion Park, a new 690,000 square foot open-air center under construction in Richmond, Virginia, will be anchored by Dillards, Saks, and Galyans. The center is scheduled to open in September 2003 and is expected to cost approximately $115 million, net of recoveries. Currently 70% of the available tenant space has executed leases. An additional 20% of tenant space is committed with leases out for signature and all remaining tenant space is under negotiation. The Company expects to have between a 10% to 11% return on its investment in 2004, when the center is expected to be close to stabilization. Full stabilization is more likely to occur in 2005.             NorthLake Mall, a new 1.2 million square foot enclosed center in Charlotte, North Carolina, will be anchored by Dillards, Hechts, Belk, and a theater. The center is scheduled to open in August 2005 and is expected to cost approximately $166 million. The Company expects returns on this investment to be approximately 11% at stabilization.             Future construction costs for Stony Point will be funded through its construction facility, while costs for NorthLake Mall will be funded through the Companys existing credit facilities until construction financing is obtained later in 2003.             The Companys $29.9 million balance of development pre-construction costs as of December 31, 2002 consists primarily of costs related to a project in Syosset, New York. Both Neiman Marcus and Lord & Taylor have made announcements committing to the project. Although the Company still needs to obtain a special use permit and site plan approval from the Oyster Bay Town Board to move forward with the project, the Company is encouraged that the Appellate Court has recently affirmed the New York State Supreme Courts decision to annul the unfavorable zoning actions of the Oyster Bay Town Board. While the Company expects to be successful in this effort, the process may still not be resolved in the near future. In addition, if the litigation is unsuccessful, the Company expects to consider its alternatives, including possible other uses for the site, but may ultimately decide to abandon the project.    39                    The Operating Partnership and The Mills Corporation have formed an alliance to develop value super-regional projects in major metropolitan markets. The amended agreement, which expires in May 2008, calls for the two companies to jointly develop and own at least four of these centers, each representing approximately $200 million of capital investment. A number of locations across the nation are targeted for future initiatives.             The following table summarizes planned capital spending, which is not recovered from tenants and assumes no acquisitions during 2003:                                                    2003  (1)                      Consolidated Businesses         Unconsolidated Joint Ventures       Beneficial Interest in Consolidated Businesses  and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures               (in millions of dollars)     Development, renovation, and expansion         102.0     (2)    10.9       106.3        Mall tenant allowances      10.2       4.6       11.7        Pre-construction development and other      8.8       1.1       9.4                     Total      121.0       16.6       127.3                                 (1)                Costs are net of intercompany profits.              (2)                Primarily includes costs related to Stony Point Fashion Park and NorthLake Mall.             (3)      Amounts in this table may not add due to rounding.             Estimates of future capital spending include only projects approved by the Companys Board of Directors and, consequently, estimates will change as new projects are approved. Estimates regarding capital expenditures, occupancy, and returns on new developments presented above are forward-looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to: (1) actual results of negotiations with anchors, tenants, and contractors, (2) changes in the scope and number of projects, (3) cost overruns, (4) timing of expenditures, (5) financing considerations, (6) actual time to complete projects, (7) changes in economic climate, (8) competition from others attracting tenants and customers, (9) increases in operating costs, (10) timing of tenant openings, and (11) early lease terminations and bankruptcies.      Dividends                The Company pays regular quarterly dividends to its common and Series A preferred shareowners. Dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash available to the Company, its financial condition, capital and other requirements, and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its shareowners, as well as meet certain other requirements. Preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings, cash availability, or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends. The preferred stock became callable in October 2002. The Company has no present intention to redeem the preferred equity.             On December 11, 2002, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share payable January 21, 2003 to shareowners of record on December 31, 2002. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51875 per share on the Companys 8.3% Series A Preferred Stock, paid December 31, 2002 to shareowners of record on December 20, 2002.             Dividends declared on the Companys common and preferred stock and their tax status are presented in the following tables.                             Year      Dividends per common share declared      Return of capital      Ordinary income      Capital gains      Unrecaptured Section 1250 capital gains           2002    $1.025    $0.4417    $0.3753    $0.1498    $0.0582     2001      1.005      0.3075      0.6878      0.0097                             Year      Dividends per Series A preferred share declared      Ordinary income      Capital gains      Unrecaptured Section 1250 capital gains           2002    $2.075    $1.6540    $0.3032    $0.1178     2001      2.075      2.0549      0.0201     40                    The portion of the dividends paid to common and preferred shareowners in 2002 for capital gains and unrecaptured Section 1250 gains are designated as capital gain dividends for tax purposes. The tax status of total 2003 common dividends declared and to be declared, assuming continuation of a $0.26 per common share quarterly dividend, is estimated to be approximately 25% return of capital, and approximately 75% ordinary income. The tax status of total 2003 dividends to be paid on Series A Preferred Stock is estimated to be 100% ordinary income. These are forward-looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially, including: (1) the amount of dividends declared, (2) changes in the Companys share of anticipated taxable income of the Operating Partnership due to the actual results of the Operating Partnership, (3) changes in the number of the Companys outstanding shares, (4) property acquisitions or dispositions, (5) financing transactions, including refinancing of existing debt, (6) changes in interest rates, (7) amount and nature of development activities, and (8) changes in the tax laws or their application.             The annual determination of the Companys common dividends is based on anticipated Funds from Operations available after preferred dividends, as well as assessments of annual capital spending, financing considerations, and other appropriate factors. Over the past several years, the Company had determined that the growth in common dividends would be less than the growth in Funds from Operations. This had resulted in the payout ratio (defined as common dividends per share as a percentage of Funds from Operations) being reduced from 106% in 1993 to less than 60% in 2002. The Company expects to evaluate its policy and the benefits of increasing dividends at a higher rate than historical increases, subject to its assessment of cash requirements.             Any inability of the Operating Partnership or its Joint Ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, including development activities and expansions, may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations, thereby possibly reducing distributions to partners of the Operating Partnership and funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends.
