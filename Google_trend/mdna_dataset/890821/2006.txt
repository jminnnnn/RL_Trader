Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Executive Overview          Revenues increased to $1,192,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 8%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer ®  audio signal processing algorithms. A key issue discussed is the difficulty in obtaining revenue traction when traditional revenue sources are eroding, while being replaced by new revenue sources at a lower rate.        Net loss was $82,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005; ($0.00) basic per share, compared to net loss of $157,000, ($0.00) per share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net loss for the current period is primarily the result of lower revenue, partially offset by lower overhead. A key issue discussed is managements efforts to reduce overhead in view of declining revenue, while maintaining competitiveness.        Net cash used by operating activities was $256,568 for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities was $343,939 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and net cash used in operating activities of $253,965 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in cash flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily a   16       result of the decrease in deferred income, the net loss, a decrease in accounts payable and a decrease in notes payable, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable. Deferred income decreased due to full revenue realization of a prior year licensing prepayment and accounts receivable decreased due to reduced year over year revenue. A key issue is the Companys ability to generate continued positive cash flow to continue operations.         The business environment in which we operate is highly competitive and is offers substantial risk. These risks should be studied and understood, as outlined in Risk Factors under Item 1A above.   Approach to MD&A          An important demonstration of our commitment to our stockholders is a clear explanation of the Companys operating results, risks and opportunities. The purpose of MD&A is to provide our shareholders and other interested parties with information necessary to gain an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. As such, we seek to satisfy three principal objectives:                       to provide a narrative explanation of a companys financial statements in plain English that enables the average investor to see the company through the eyes of management;                           to enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which financial information should be analyzed; and                           to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, a companys earnings and cash flow, so that investors can ascertain the likelihood and relationship of past performance being indicative of future performance.            We believe the best way to achieve this is to give the reader:                       An understanding of our operating environment and its risks                           An outline of critical accounting policies                           A review of our corporate governance structure                           A review of the key components of the financial statements and our cash position and capital resources                           A review of the important trends in the financial statements and our cash flow                           Disclosure on our internal controls and procedures       Operating Environment          We operate in a very competitive business environment. This environment impacts us in the following ways, further discussed in greater detail under Item 1A above.                       Our Board of Directors has Determined it is in the Companys and its Stockholders Interests to Attempt to Sell the Companys Assets                           We Face Significant Pricing Pressure and Competition that has Resulted in Our Technology Being Designed Out Within a Short Time Frame, and Impeded Efforts to Secure New Design Wins                           New Customer Product Development Has been Delayed. This Resulted in Delays In Revenues. Further, Where our Products are Delayed, Competitive Products May Reach The Market Before, or Replace Our Products.                           We Rely on the Schedules and Cooperation of Chip Makers or Other Third Parties to Deliver Our Technology in Consumer Products. These Third parties Have Their Own Priorities and Alliances that Delayed or Could Thwart our Sales Efforts to Potential Customers.      17               We have experienced a loss from operations in four of the last five fiscal years. In December 2005 our revenues were stagnant, with those from certain of our major customers to decrease significantly in 2006. Revenues from certain of our other customers appear not to be sustainable in the future. In December 2005, two of our three independent directors resigned and the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary resigned from all positions held with the Company other than as a director, Chairman and Secretary. For these and other reasons, and after exploring other exit strategies and opportunities, our Board of Directors concluded in December 2005 to attempt to sell the Company either through a sale of assets or a sale of multiple, non-exclusive perpetual licenses with a subsequent sale of the residual assets and engaged Strategic Equity Group to assist us in this endeavor. Following such transaction, it is anticipated that the Company would be wound up and dissolved. The consummation of any such transaction and the determination to wind up and dissolve is subject to stockholder approval. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to negotiate an agreement for the sale of assets. There is no assurance that, if such an agreement is successfully negotiated, that such transaction will be approved by stockholders or consummated. Further, even if such transaction is consummated, there is no assurance that there will be any funds available for distribution to stockholders. If such sale and subsequent wind up and dissolution is not approved, the Board of Directors will be required to explore other alternatives for the Company and its business.   We have experienced a loss from operations in four of the last five years. We experienced losses in the last two years. While our objective and full effort has been on managing a profitable business, due to the market conditions and factors outlined in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and their impact on fluctuations in operating expenses and revenues, we no longer believe that we will be able to generate a positive profit position in any given future period, nor do we believe that is feasible. We cannot guarantee that we will increase sales of our products and technologies, or that we will successfully develop and market any additional products, or achieve or sustain future profitability. We cannot, because of market and business conditions, rely on the sale of shares or on debt financings in the future. Further, we do not believe that debt or equity financing will be available as required and as such, have decided to try to sell the assets of the Company.   The PC and consumer electronics markets are under intense pressure, primarily from retailers, to reduce selling prices, with resultant pressure to reduce costs. In addition, certain of our competitors appear to be pursuing a business plan that disregards commercially reasonable pricing to achieve a larger market penetration even if the penetration will not provide for viable margins or returns. Cost reductions are driven by lower cost sourcing, often in China, design simplification and reduction in or substitution of features. Therefore, we have been seeking commercial acceptance of our products in highly competitive markets. We responded by offering additional products targeted to each price and quality segment of the market, more aggressively priced and feature enriched our products and entered new segments, such as cell phones, with different competitive pressure. Our value proposition that stressed the cost reducing capabilities of our audio solutions through improved performance from lower cost components as well as product differentiation that Spatializer technology can deliver, failed to resonate with our targeted customers in this highly competitive environment. The result was the elimination of features, including ours, to reduce cost. There is no assurance that our present or contemplated future products or a repositioned value proposition will achieve or maintain sufficient commercial acceptance, or if they do, that functionally equivalent products will not be developed by current or future competitors or customers who had access to significantly greater resources or which are willing to give away their products.   Spatializer does not develop or market semiconductors. That is why we carry no inventory or have order backlogs that typically are good indicators of near term performance. Rather, we develop audio algorithms that are embedded on third party processors or semiconductors used by our customers. While our algorithms are implemented on a wide array of processors, often times a customer uses a processor where there is no such implementation, or where a competing solution has been implemented. In this case, our customers request that our algorithm be implemented. While these requests are typically honored, processor manufacturers must schedule such implementation as their resources or corporate strategies allow. Therefore, the supply-chain is often quite long and complicated, which potentially can result in delays or deadlines that may not always coincide with our customers requirements and which are beyond the control of our company .  In addition, standards may be adopted by cell phone system operators or manufacturers that may impede or prevent the penetration of non-standard technology onto their platforms. Lastly, customer implementation delays have put off expected cash flow into the future, beyond the time frame of operations based on our available cash resources.   Therefore, when reviewing the operating results or drawing conclusions with regard to future performance, these competitive forces and uncertainties must be taken into consideration. Though there is no absolute long-term visibility, it is likely that our operations would fail if we attempted to continue long-term in this environment. Hence, the Companys Board of Directors has decided to attempt to sell the assets of the Company and liquidate the business, subject to stockholders approval.    Critical Accounting Policies          Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated statements, which   18       have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In consultation with our Board of Directors and Audit Committee, we have identified three accounting policies that we believe are critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These are important accounting policies that require managements most difficult, subjective judgments.         The first critical accounting policy relates to revenue recognition. We recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to the customer. License revenues are recognized when earned, in accordance with the contractual provisions. Royalty revenues are recognized upon shipment of products incorporating the related technology by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and foundries. These revenues are reported to us by our Licensees in formal, written royalty reports, which serve as the basis for our quarterly revenue accruals. Infrequently, certain written reports are received after our required reporting deadlines, sometimes due to contractual requirements. In such cases, management tries to obtain verbal reports or informal reports from the Licensee. In the absence of such information, management may utilize conservative estimates based on information received or historical trends. In such isolated cases, management strives to under-estimate such revenues to err on the side of caution. In the event such estimates are used, the revenue for the following quarter is adjusted based on receipt of the written report. In addition, any error in Licensee reporting, which is very infrequent, is adjusted in the subsequent quarter when agreed by both parties as correct.        The second critical accounting policy relates to research and development expenses. We expense all research and development expenses as incurred. Costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of our algorithms (which is the primary component of our licensing) is expensed as incurred and included in Research and Development expenses. Such algorithms are refined based on customer requirements and licensed for inclusion in the customers specific product. There are no production costs to capitalize as defined in Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 86.        The third critical accounting policy relates to intangible assets. Our intangible assets consist primarily of patents. We capitalize all costs directly attributable to patents and trademarks, consisting primarily of legal and filing fees, and amortize such costs over the remaining life of the asset (which range from 3 to 20 years) using the straight-line method. In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, only intangible assets with definite lives are amortized. Non-amortized intangible assets are instead subject to annual impairment testing.   Corporate Governance           Audit Committee         This committee is directed to review the scope, cost and results of the independent audit of our books and records, the results of the annual audit with management and the internal auditors and the adequacy of our accounting, financial, and operating controls; to recommend annually to the Board of Directors the selection of the independent auditors; to approve proposals made by our independent auditors for consulting work; and to report to the Board of Directors, when so requested, on any accounting of financial matters. Gilbert Segel was the only independent director on this committee. Mr. Segel resigned from our Board of Directors in December 2005. Mr. Mandell, Chairman of the Board and Secretary of the Company, served as ex-officio member of the Audit Committee during fiscal year 2005. Mr. Mandell resigned his employment with Company effective January 6, 2006. There were no members of the committee upon the resignation of Mr. Segel.         Compensation and Stock Committee         Our Compensation and Stock Option Committee (the Compensation Committee) consisted of Messrs. Pace and Segel, each of whom was a non-employee director of the Company and a disinterested person with respect to the plans administered by such committee, as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, the Exchange Act). The Compensation Committee reviews and approves annual salaries, bonuses and other forms and items of compensation for our senior officers and employees. Except for plans that are, in accordance with their terms or as required by law, administered by the Board of Directors or another particularly designated group, the Compensation Committee also administers and implements all of our stock option and other stock-based and equity-based benefit plans (including performance-based plans), recommends changes or additions to those plans or awards under the plans. Messrs. Pace and Segel resigned as directors in December 2005.   Our Audit Committee and Compensation and Stock Committee charters are available in print to any stockholder upon request in   19       writing to our principal corporate office at 2025 Gateway place, Suite 365, San Jose, California 95110.    Key Components of the Financial Statements and Important Trends          The financial statements, including the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity, should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. MD&A explains the key components of each of these financial statements, key trends and reasons for reporting period-to-period fluctuations.        The Consolidated Balance Sheet provides a snapshot view of our financial condition at the end of our fiscal year. A balance sheet helps management and our stockholders understand the financial strength and capabilities of our business. Balance sheets can help identify and analyze trends, particularly in the area of receivables and payables. A review of cash compared to the comparable year and in relation to ongoing profit or loss can show the ability of the Company to withstand business variations. The relationship between Current Assets and Current Liabilities Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) measures how much in liquid assets a company has available to build its business. The presence of Deferred Revenue indicates cash received on revenue to be earned over the next twelve months. Receivables that are substantially higher than revenue for the quarter may indicate a slowdown of collections, with an impact on future cash position. This is addressed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.              The Consolidated Statement of Operations tells the reader whether the Company had a profit or loss. It shows key sources of revenue and major expense categories. It is important to note period-to-period comparisons of each line item of this statement, reasons for any fluctuation and how costs are managed in relation to the overall revenue trend of the business. These statements are prepared using accrual accounting under generally accepted accounting standards in the United States. This is addressed further in MD&A under Revenues and Expenses.              The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows explains the actual sources and uses of cash. Some expenses of the Company, such as depreciation and amortization do not result in a cash outflow in the current period, since the underlying patent expenditure or asset purchase was made years earlier. New capital expenditures, on the other hand, result in a disbursement of cash, but will be expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over its useful life. Fluctuations in receivables and payables also explain why the net change in cash is not equal to the loss reported on the Statement of Operations. Therefore, it is possible that the impact of a net loss on cash is less or more than the actual amount of the loss. This is discussed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.               The Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity shows the impact of the operating results on the Companys equity. In addition, this statement shows new equity brought into the Company through stock sales or stock option exercise. This is discussed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.     Results of Operations          The following discussion and analysis relates to our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, and the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.   For the Year Ended December 31, 2005, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004           Revenues         Revenues increased to $1,192,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 8%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer ®  audio signal processing algorithms.        The increase in revenue resulted from a greater recognition of deferred revenue in the current year, as compared to the prior year, in which a royalty advance was received. In addition, revenues increased from royalties on a third party semiconductor used in cellular phones, as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by declining revenues from two accounts whose products using our technology reached end of life. Their new models do not utilize our technology.   20              Gross Profit         Gross profit increased to $1,086,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $995,000 in the comparable period last year, an increase of 9%. Gross margin was 91% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with 90% of revenue for the comparable period last year. The increase in gross profit resulted from higher revenues in fiscal 2005. We maintain a high margin since revenues are from licensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated direct manufacturing or selling costs other than commissions paid to our independent representatives that solicit and oversee the particular accounts. All development costs are expensed as engineering and development expenses in the period they are incurred.         Operating Expenses         Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased to $1,177,000 (99% of sales) from $1,146,000 (105% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 3%. The increase in operating expenses resulted primarily from increases in general and administrative expense and sales and marketing expense. General and Administrative expenses increased due to higher legal and audit expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased due to higher travel expenses resulting from more overseas licensing trips.         General and Administrative         General and administrative expense increased to $670,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $615,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 9%. The increase is primarily due to increased legal and accounting expenses related to public filings, in part in response to the additional requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and to increased travel costs by the CEO. General operating costs include rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery, postage, depreciation and similar costs.         Research and Development         Research and Development costs decreased to $354,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $393,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 10%. The decrease in research and development expense was due to the commencement of the use of lower cost applications engineering consultants in India in the second half of 2004 and the elimination of an in-house applications engineering position in early 2005. The number of projects completed by the Indian engineering firm were higher in 2005 as compared to 2004, partially offsetting the savings from the eliminated in-house engineering staff position.        We continued efforts to identify, validate, and develop new product ideas at DPI. Specific engineering efforts were directed toward the launch of Spatializer ((environ)) 3G and applications engineering to port our technology to leading processor platforms.         Sales and Marketing         Sales and Marketing costs increased to $152,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 10%. The increase in such expenses resulted from higher international travel in search of new licensing arrangements.         Net Income (Loss)         Net loss was $81,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005; ($0.00) basic per share, compared to net loss of $157,000, ($0.00) per share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The reduction in net loss for the current period is primarily the result of higher revenue, partially offset by higher overhead.   For the Year Ended December 31, 2004, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003           Revenues         Revenues decreased to $1,106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $1,269,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 13%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer ®  audio   21       signal processing algorithms.         While the overall decrease was relatively modest, the revenue mix by licensee platform was significantly different year over year. The decrease in revenues is attributed primarily to the loss or reduction at three key DVD player accounts and one PC account which in aggregate, generated approximately 56% of total fiscal 2003 revenue. In each case, these licensees decided to use no licensed virtual surround solution or opted for a free solution from their chip supplier, driven primarily by cost reduction pressure. These losses were partially offset by three new revenue sources in cellular phones, mobile audio semiconductors and PCs, and the expansion of an existing license relating to recordable DVD.         Gross Profit         Gross profit decreased to $995,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $1,147,000 in the comparable period last year, a decrease of 13%. Gross margin held steady at 90% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with 90% of revenue for the comparable period last year. The decrease in gross profit results from lower revenues in the current year We maintain a high margin since revenues are from licensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated direct manufacturing or selling costs other than commissions paid to our independent representatives that solicit and oversee the particular accounts. All development costs are expensed as engineering and development expenses in the period they are incurred.         Operating Expenses         Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased to $1,146,000 (105% of sales) from $1,631,000 (128% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 30%. The decrease in operating expenses results primarily from reductions in general and administrative expense and sales and marketing expense. General and Administrative expenses declined due to the relocation to smaller and less expensive offices in December 2003 and lower occupancy-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses declined due to the elimination of a marketing and business development executive position and related travel in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the restructuring of our Japan sales operation. These responsibilities were transferred to another executive and to a new commissioned representative firm in Japan.         General and Administrative         General and administrative expense decreased to $615,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $811,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 24%. The decrease is primarily due to the relocation of our offices to smaller and lower cost facilities in December 2003, upon expiration of an existing lease, lower occupancy related expenses, partially offset by increased legal and accounting expenses related to public filings, in part in response to the additional requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and increased travel by the CEO. General operating costs include rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery, postage, depreciation and similar costs.         Research and Development         Research and Development costs decreased to $393,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $459,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 14%. The decrease in research and development expense was due to the commencement of the use of lower cost specialist consultants in India in the second half of 2004.        We continued efforts to identify, validate, and develop new product ideas at DPI. Specific engineering efforts were directed toward the launch of Spatializer Audio Alchemy, refinement of Spatializer Natural Headphone, development of new cell phone solutions and applications engineering to port our technology to leading processor platforms.         Sales and Marketing         Sales and Marketing costs decreased to $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $361,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 62%. The reduction in such expenses resulted from the elimination of a sales consultant position, the elimination of a sales executive position in the third quarter of 2003 and fewer trade show participations.    22                Net Income (Loss)         Net loss was $157,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004; ($0.00) basic per share, compared to net loss of $495,000, ($0.01) per share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net loss for the current period is primarily the result of lower revenue, partially offset by lower overhead.   Liquidity and Capital Resources          At December 31, 2005, we had $551,000 in cash and cash equivalents as compared to $871,000 at December 31, 2004. The decrease in cash resulted from full recognition of deferred income, the net loss, a decrease in accounts payable and a decrease in notes payable, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable. Deferred income decreased due to full revenue realization of a prior year licensing prepayment and accounts receivable decreased due to reduced year over year revenue. We had working capital of $560,000 at December 31, 2005 as compared with working capital of $586,000 at December 31, 2004.        Net cash used by operating activities was $256,568 for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $343,939 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and net cash used by operating activities of $253,965 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in cash flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily a result of the decrease in deferred income, the net loss, a decrease in accounts payable and notes payable, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable.        We use cash in investing activities primarily to secure patent and trademark protection for our proprietary technology and brand name, and to purchase short-term investments such as bank certificates of deposit. Cash used in investing activities totaled $8,145, $20,587 and $20,709, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. All expenditures for on-going research and development are expenses and therefore included in the Net Loss.        Net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $55,809 and $41,994 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $5,746 for the years ended December 31, 2003.        In December 2005, the Company, as stipulated by the related Subscription Agreement, forced the conversion of all outstanding Series B-1 Preferred Stock, into Restricted Common Stock at the minimum conversion price of $.56 per share. This resulted in the issuance of 1,788,018 Common Stock shares, worth approximately $100,000 at market value at issuance. This issuance diluted existing common stockholders by approximately 4%, but eliminated $1.1 million in liquidation preference shares.        In the fourth quarter of 2003, we negotiated and completed the conversion of a $112,500 related party 10% demand note to a three-year 10% term note. Principal and interest of $5,191 is paid monthly, which we pay on a current basis. Since the director who was an indirect beneficiary of the demand note retired from the Board of Directors in June 2003, the demand note is classified as a note payable at December 31, 2004. There are no installments due in more than twelve months as of December 31, 2004.        Future payments due under operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2005 are described below:                                                                                                                             Payments due by period                                    Less than                                                 More than      Contractual obligations         Total         1 year         1-3 years         3-5 years         5 years         Long-Term Debt Obligations                                                                                                          Capital Lease Obligations                                                                                                          Operating Lease Obligations         $    26,900              $    26,700              $    200                                                   Purchase Obligations                                                                                                          Total         $    26,900              $    26,700              $    200                                                          In the event the Company is to be would up and dissolved the Company would attempt to settle these amounts, negotiate early termination, or pay the remaining obligation if cash resources permitted.        Our future cash flow will come primarily from the audio signal processing licensing and OEM royalties until or if our efforts to sell the assets of the company, with stockholders approval, is consummated and in that case from any net proceeds from the sale of   23          assets or perpetual licenses. The Board of Directors will, with the approval of the stockholders, decide on the dispensation of such proceeds.        The fluid, competitive and dynamic nature of the market continues a high degree of uncertainty to our operations. The operations of our business, and those of our competitors, are also impacted by the continued trend in the semiconductor industry to offer free, but minimal audio solutions to certain product classes to maintain and attract market share. In addition, the commoditization of many consumer electronics segments, our lack of resources and the departure of key employee and directors has made it unfeasible to continue to compete.        Based on current and projected operating levels, we no longer believe that we can maintain our liquidity position at a consistent level both on a short-term and long-term basis. As such, we do not believe our current cash reserves and cash generated from our existing operations and customer base are sufficient for us to meet our operating obligations and the anticipated additional research and development for our audio technology business for at least the next 12 months.        On January 10, 2006, the Company announced that it would hold an open auction for the sale of substantially all of its assets. The Board of Directors of the Company decided that it is in the best interests of the stockholders to hold an open auction for the acquisition of the assets of the Company or the granting of an unlimited amount of non-exclusive perpetual licenses for a one-time fee and a subsequent auction of the residual assets. The consummation of any of such transactions will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company. The Company received non-conforming bids for such assets on the February 15, 2006 deadline. The Board of Directors of the company, in consultation with their financial and legal advisors, extended the auction period to March 10, 2006, to provide bidders and other interested parties additional time to clarify their offers and perform due diligence, as well as to solicit additional offers. Negotiations continue with auction participants who submitted bids by March 10, 2006 and will announce its decision upon completion of its evaluation of such bids.   Net Operating Loss Carry forwards          At December 31, 2005, we had net operating loss carry forwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately $26,500,000 which are available to offset future Federal taxable income, if any, through 2014. Approximately $21,700,000 of these net operating loss carry forwards is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $1,000,000.   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements          In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. This Statement is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This Statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related implementation guidance. This Statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. The Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in Statement 123 as originally issued and EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. This Statement does not address the accounting for employee share ownership plans, which are subject to AICPA Statement of Position 93-6, Employers Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans. The Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed the adoption requirement of SFAS No. 123R until the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. We adopted SFAS No. 123R as of January 1, 2006 as required.   In May 2005 the FASB issued SFAS 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. This Statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and also corrections of error in previously issued financial statements. This Statement harmonizes US accounting standards with existing international accounting standards by requiring companies to report voluntary changes in accounting principles via a retrospective application, unless impracticable. Also, the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retrospectively. This pronouncement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005      Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     24          We have not been exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on our short-term investments at December 31, 2005. A hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in interest rate (ten percent of our overall earnings rate) would not result in a material fluctuation in future earnings or cash flow. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or for speculative purposes and we are not currently evaluating the future use of such financial instruments.    25              Item 8.
