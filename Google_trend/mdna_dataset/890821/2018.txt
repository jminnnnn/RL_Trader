ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information    The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.  Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period. This report contains “forward-looking statements.”  The statements, which are not historical facts contained in this report, including this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and notes to our consolidated financial statements, particularly those that utilize terminology such as “may” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “believes,” or “plans” or comparable terminology are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on currently available operating, financial and competitive information, and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Future events and our actual results may differ materially from the results reflected in these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, our ability to raise additional funding, our ability to maintain and grow our business, variability of operating results, our ability to maintain and enhance our brand, our development and introduction of new products and services, the successful integration of acquired companies, technologies and assets into our portfolio of software and services, marketing and other business development initiatives, competition in the industry, general government regulation, economic conditions, dependence on key personnel, the ability to attract, hire and retain personnel who possess the technical skills and experience necessary to meet the service requirements of our clients, our ability to protect our intellectual property, the potential liability with respect to actions taken by our existing and past employees, risks associated with international sales and other risks described herein and in our other filings with the SEC.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.     Company History    We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in February 1994 as Spatializer Audio Laboratories, Inc., which had been a shell company until May of 2015. On May 26, 2015, we completed a “reverse merger” transaction, in which we caused Ameri100 Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation as our newly created, wholly owned subsidiary, to be merged with and into Ameri and Partners (doing business as Ameri100), a Delaware corporation. As a result of the Merger, Ameri and Partners became our wholly owned subsidiary with Ameri and Partners’ former stockholders acquiring a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock.  The Merger was consummated under Delaware law, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in connection with the Merger we changed our name to AMERI Holdings, Inc.  Since the Merger, we have been an active holding company headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, with offices across the United States that are supported by offices in India.      31        Overview    We specialize in delivering SAP cloud, digital and enterprise services to clients worldwide. Our SAP focus allows us to provide technological solutions to a broad and growing base of clients. Our model inverts the conventional global delivery model wherein offshore IT service providers are based abroad and maintain a minimal presence in the United States. With a strong SAP focus, our client partnerships anchor around SAP cloud and digital services. We pursue an acquisition strategy that seeks to disrupt the established business model of offshore IT service providers.    We partnered with NEC Corporation of America (NEC), in February 2017, to offer SAP HANA Migration services. Through this partnership, the Company will offer solutions to its clients aspiring to make the transition from SAP ECC (on-premise) applications to SAP HANA applications. NEC is a leading technology integrator providing integrated communications, analytics, security, biometrics and technology solutions.    We generate revenue by providing consulting services under written service contracts with our customers. The service contracts we enter into generally fall into two categories: (1) time-and-materials contracts and (2) fixed-price contracts.    When a customer enters into a time-and-materials or fixed-price (or a periodic retainer-based) contract, the revenue is recognized in accordance with the deliverables of each contract. If the deliverables involve separate units of accounting, the consideration from the arrangement is measured and allocated to the separate units, based on vendor specific objective evidence of the value for each deliverable.    The revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates. Revenue pursuant to fixed-price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting. We routinely evaluate whether revenue and profitability should be recognized in the current period. We estimate the proportional performance on fixed-price contracts on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project.    For the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, sales to five major customers accounted for approximately 43% and 53% of our total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, one of our customers contributed 11% of our revenue, and for year ended December 31, 2016, two of our customers contributed 16% and 13% of our revenues, respectively.    During the year ended December 31, 2017, we streamlined our operations by eliminating redundant positions across our acquired entities, which resulted in a restructuring charge of approximately $0.4 million and the elimination of 26 employees. We anticipate that streamlining of our operations will result in annual savings of approximately $1.75 million, inclusive of payroll, benefits, office consolidations and other ancillary employee related costs.    We continue to explore strategic alternatives to improve the market position and profitability of our product and service offerings in the marketplace, generate additional liquidity for the Company, and enhance our valuation. We plan to pursue our goals during the next twelve months principally through organic growth and through strategic alternatives. Some of these alternatives have included, and could continue to include, selective acquisitions. We have obtained financing and additional capital from the sale of equity and incurrence of indebtedness in the past, and we continue to consider capital raising and financing from the sale of various types of equity and incurrence of indebtedness to provide capital for our business plans and operations in the future.    Matters that May or Are Currently Affecting Our Business    The main challenges and trends that could affect or are affecting our financial results include:        ·   Our ability to enter into additional technology-management and consulting agreements, to diversify our client base and to expand the geographic areas we serve;            ·   Our ability to attract competent, skilled professionals and on-demand technology partners for our operations at acceptable prices to manage our overhead;            ·   Our ability to acquire other technology services companies and integrate them with our existing business;            ·   Our ability to raise additional equity capital, if and when we needed;            ·   We may incur an impairment of the goodwill acquired from our prior business acquisitions if our acquired entities do not experience growth; and            ·   Our ability to control our costs of operation as we expand our organization and capabilities.          32        We have incurred significant and recurring operational losses as a result of our ongoing acquisition strategy. We have outstanding cash payment obligations related to our past acquisitions of approximately  $ 4.3 million.  In addition, under the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock, we are currently obligated to pay approximately $2 million in dividends per year on such stock through fiscal year 2019. If our current cash position does not improve significantly, we will not have sufficient cash on hand to meet these obligations.  Due to our working capital constraints, we are not current in all payments to all our unsecured noteholders. We are working with certain of our unsecured noteholders to negotiate payment terms until we are able to raise more capital.      Operational streamlining that was completed in 2017 is anticipated to provide cash savings of approximately  $ 1.75 million per year. We believe additional cost-cutting efforts will further reduce cash used in operations.  In addition, we believe that we can obtain additional external financing to meet future cash requirements. We raised $1.25 million in March 2017 through the sale of convertible notes and over $6.7 million in gross proceeds through our public offering of common stock and warrants in November 2017.     There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional sources of capital or that cost savings will provide sufficient working capital.  If we continue to be unable to pay all outstanding payments under our unsecured notes, the unpaid noteholders may take legal action against us, they may accelerate the payment of the principal under the applicable notes, and our senior secured lender may call a cross-default under our existing credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of the obligations thereunder and have a negative impact on our revenue and financial results.  Should we be unable to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, we could be forced to cease operations. Our plan regarding these matters is to work to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to allow us the ability to cover our current cash flow requirements and meet our obligations as they become due. There can be no assurances that financing will be available or if available, that such financing will be available under favorable terms.

Our Ameri and Partners and Ameri Georgia subsidiaries, together, experienced a decline in revenue in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to attrition of low margin business. The table below sets forth changes in revenue by our primary operating businesses.    Revenues by Primary Operating Businesses  (in millions of U.S. dollars)              Year Ended   December 31, 2017       Year Ended   December 31, 2016       Increase (Decrease)            Ameri and Partners / Ameri Georgia    25.80       28.48       (2.68)            Ameri Arizona    13.35       7.65       5.70            Ameri California    9.43       -       9.43            Total    48.59       36.15       12.45          For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, sales to five major customers accounted for approximately 43% and 53% of our total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, one of our customers contributed 11% of our revenue, and for the year ended December 31, 2016, two of our customers contributed 16% and 13% of our revenue, respectively.  We derived most of our revenues from our customers located in North America for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.    Gross Margin    Our gross margin was 21% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 19% for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Gross margin from Ameri California, which was acquired in March 2017, was 26%; without this acquisition our gross margin would have been 20%.    Our target gross margins in future periods are anticipated to be in the range of 20% to 25% based on a mix of project revenues and professional service revenues. However, there is no assurance that we will achieve such anticipated gross margins.    Selling, General and Administration Expenses    Selling, general and administration (“SG&A”) expenses include all costs, including rent costs, which are not directly associated with revenue-generating activities, as well as the non-cash expense for stock based compensation. These include employee costs, corporate costs and facilities costs. Employee costs include administrative salaries and related employee benefits, travel, recruiting and training costs. Corporate costs include reorganization costs, legal, accounting and outside consulting fees. Facilities costs primarily include rent and communications costs.    SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $18.5 million, as compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  SG&A expenses increased by $9.5 million, of which $5.6 million was attributable to stock based compensation expense due to grants made to our employees, accelerated expenses upon cancellation of restricted stock units in the second quarter of 2017, a charge related to the cashless exercise of warrant exercised by LSVI in the third quarter of 2017 and stock compensation expenses incurred due to the issuance of shares to a director as a bonus for services provided to the Company in 2017.    Our acquisition of Ameri California added an additional $2.2 million to our SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017. The remaining increase in SG&A was attributable to the full-year results of our 2016 acquisitions in our 2017 fiscal year, while they only contributed to our results for a portion of 2016.      34        Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We capitalized the customer lists acquired during various acquisitions, resulting in increased amortization costs. The customer lists from each acquisition are amortized over a period of 60 months.  Our amortization schedule is as follows:       Year ending December 31,       Amount                       2018          2,825,148         2019          2,457,806         2020          2,326,000         2021          1,510,749         2022          350,000         Total       $    9,469,703          Operating loss    Our operating loss was $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in loss was mainly due to the significant increase in stock based compensation expenses and incremental expenses from acquired entities in 2017 and 2016.    Interest Expense    Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.6 million as compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to differences in interest rates in 2017 as compared to 2016.    Changes in Estimates    Changes in estimates represents a reduction of $1.1 million in contingent consideration payable for previously acquired entities which did not meet their earn-out targets.    Income Taxes    Our benefit from income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $2.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The benefits from income taxes are due to recurring net operating losses of the Company.    Acquisition Related Expenses    We had acquisition related expenditures of $0.5 million and $1.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. These expenses included legal, professional services, valuation and due diligence services and other acquisition related fees incurred in connection with our acquisitions. The decrease was due to the decline in acquisition related activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    Our cash position was $4.9 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.4 million as of December 31, 2016.  The increase in our cash position was primarily due to the funds received from our November 2017 public offering.  We currently anticipate payments of $5.5 million toward cash obligations in respect of completed acquisitions, including for the payment of potential earn-outs during the next 12 months.    Cash used for operating activities was $2.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.  We were able to control the level of cash used for operating activities from year to year through cost-cutting measures that reduced working capital requirements. Cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash provided by financing activities was $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and was attributable to the sale of common stock and warrants in our November 2017 public offering, our private placement of convertible notes in March 2017 and net bank borrowings.      35        Public Offering    On November 21, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of $4.115 per share, and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of $0.01 per warrant. The warrants have a per share exercise price of $4.115, were exercisable as of November 21, 2017 and expire five years from that date. The gross proceeds to us from this offering were approximately $6,084,375, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses.  In connection with the offering, we uplisted our common stock from the OTCQB Marketplace to trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “AMRH”, and we listed the publicly offered warrants for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “AMRHW”.    On January 24, 2018, we received confirmation from our transfer agent, Corporate Stock Transfer, Inc., which also serves as the warrant agent for the public warrant, that through such date certain holders of warrants had cumulatively exercised warrants for the purchase of a total of 153,060 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $4.115 per share, for gross proceeds to us of $629,841.90.     Liquidity Concerns     We incurred recurring losses as a result of costs and expenses related to our selling, general and administration activities. As of December 31, 2017, we had negative working capital of  $15.7 million and cash of $4.9 million.  Our principal sources of cash have included bank borrowings, the private placement of convertible notes and the public offering of securities. To increase revenues, our operating expenses are likely to continue to grow and, as a result, we will need to generate significant additional revenues to cover such expenses.      Our financial statements as of December 31, 2017 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional funding through the issuance of equity or debt securities, as well as to attain further operating efficiencies and, ultimately, to generate additional revenues. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We can give no assurances that additional capital that we are able to obtain, if any, will be sufficient to meet our needs. The foregoing conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue  our operations .        Available Credit Facility, Borrowings and Repayment of Debt    On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), with its wholly-owned subsidiaries Ameri and Partners and Ameri Georgia, as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Linear Logics, Corp. and WinHire Inc .  (dissolved in March 2017) serving as guarantors, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, serving as a validity guarantor, and Sterling National Bank, N.A. (as lender and as agent, “Sterling”). The Company joined Ameri California, Virtuoso and Ameri Arizona as borrowers under the Loan Agreement following their respective acquisition.     Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers can borrow up to an aggregate of $10 million, which includes up to $8 million in principal for revolving loans (the “Revolving Loans”) for general working capital purposes, up to $2 million in principal pursuant to a term loan (the “Term Loan”) for the purpose of a permitted business acquisition and up to $200,000 for letters of credit. A portion of the proceeds of the Loan Agreement were also used to repay the November 20, 2015 credit facility that was entered into between the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Ameri Georgia and Federal National Payables, Inc.    The maturity of the loans under the Loan Agreement are as follows:    Revolving Loan Maturity Date: July 1, 2019; provided, however, that the Revolving Loan Maturity Date will extend and renew automatically for successive one-year terms on each anniversary of the initial Revolving Loan Maturity Date (each an “Anniversary Date”) thereafter, unless not less than sixty (60) days prior to any such Anniversary Date, written notice of non-renewal is given by either party to the other, in which case the Revolving Loan Maturity Date will be such next Anniversary Date.    Term Loan Maturity Date: The earliest of (a) the date following acceleration of the Term Loan and/or the Revolving Loans; (b) the Revolving Loan Maturity Date; or (c) July 1, 2019.    Interest under the Loan Agreement is payable monthly in arrears and accrues as follows:        (a)   in the case of Revolving Loans, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus (ii) 2.00%;            (b)   in the case of the Term Loan, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus (ii) 3.75%; and          36            (c)   in the case of other obligations of the Borrowers, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (A) 3.25% or (B) Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus (ii) 3.75%.        The Loan Agreement also requires the payment of certain fees, including, but not limited to letter of credit fees and an unused Revolving Loans fee.    The Loan Agreement contains financial and other covenant requirements, including, but not limited to, financial covenants that require the Borrowers to not permit capital expenditures above $150,000 in any fiscal year, maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 and maintain certain debt to EBITDA ratios. The Loan Agreement also requires the Company and Borrowers to obtain Sterling’s consent before making any permitted acquisitions. The amounts borrowed by the Borrowers under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the guarantors, and the Loan Agreement is secured by substantially all of the Borrowers’ assets.    The principal amount of the Term Loan will be repaid as follows: (i) equal consecutive monthly installments in the amount of $33,333.33 each, paid on the first day of each calendar month and (ii) one final payment of the entire remaining principal balance, together with all accrued unpaid interest on the Term Loan maturity date.    On August 28, 2017, pursuant to an amendment of the Loan Agreement, we and certain of our subsidiaries obtained an incremental term loan from Sterling National Bank in the amount of $343,200.58, which amount was an addition to and comprised a part of the existing Term Loan under the existing Loan Agreement. In January 2018, we repaid the incremental term loan.    To date, we are not in compliance with the financial covenants contained in its Loan Agreement with Sterling National Bank.  We received waivers from Sterling National Bank for our non-compliance with the Loan Agreement for the quarters ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and  December 31, 2017  in exchange for the payment of a fee of $5,000 for each quarterly waiver. We do not expect Sterling National Bank to continue to grant further waivers for continued non-compliance.     If we are not in compliance with the Loan Agreement in the future and we are unable to obtain future waivers from Sterling National Bank, the bank could declare our loans with it to be in default and elect to claim all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we are unable to repay the outstanding amounts, Sterling National Bank could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure our indebtedness to it. We pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement is also supported by a validity guaranty from our former Chief Executive Officer. If Sterling National Bank accelerates the repayment of our loans, there is no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay the loans. A default under the Loan Agreement may also result in an event of default under the 2017 Notes. We are currently looking for additional sources of financing, however there is no guarantee that we will have additional financing available to us.     Interest paid on the Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $0.15 million. Principal repaid on the Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.4 million. The short term and long-term outstanding balances on the Term Loan as of December 31, 2017 were $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans as of December 31, 2017 was $3.7 million.    Bigtech, which was acquired as of July 1, 2016, had a term loan of $0.01 million and a line of credit for $0.36 million as of December 31, 2017. The Bigtech line of credit is with an Indian bank, HDFC Bank Limited, and was entered into on September 3, 2015 for Bigtech’s working capital requirements. The line of credit is for up to $0.42 million with an interest rate of 11.85% per annum and maturity in June 2020. The Bigtech term loan accrues interest at the rate of 10.30% per annum and matures in 2020. Both the term loan and the line of credit were already in place when the Company acquired Bigtech. Interest paid during the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $2,015 for the term loan and $37,719 line of credit held by Bigtech.    For the purpose of financing the ongoing business and operations of our company, on April 20, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Dhruwa N. Rai, pursuant to which Mr. Rai purchased 500,000 unregistered shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, from us at a price per share of $6.00 for aggregate consideration to us of $3 million.    On May 13, 2016, LSVI completed an early partial exercise of its Original Warrant for 1,111,111 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.80 per share, for total consideration to us of $2 million, and LSVI was issued the Replacement Warrant for the remaining 1,666,666 shares under the Original Warrant on the same terms as the Original Warrant.    On March 7, 2017, we completed the sale and issuance of the 2017 Notes for aggregate proceeds to us of $1.25 million from four accredited investors, including one of the Company’s then-directors, Dhruwa N. Rai, and David Luci, who became a director of the Company in February 2018. The 2017 Notes were issued pursuant to Securities Purchase Agreements between the Company and each investor. The 2017 Notes bear interest at 8% per annum until maturity in March 2020, with interest being paid annually on the first, second and third anniversaries of the issuance of the 2017 Notes beginning in March 2018. From and after an event of default and for so long as the event of default is continuing, the 2017 Notes will bear default interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The 2017 Notes can be prepaid by us at any time without penalty. As of March 29, 2018, we are not current in the payment of interest on all of the 2017 Notes and are in discussion with holders of the 2017 notes for which we are not current in the payment of interest to negotiate longer payment terms until we are able to raise more capital.      37        The 2017 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $2.80. The holders of the 2017 Notes have the right, at their option, at any time and from time to time to convert, in part or in whole, the outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest under the 2017 Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price.    The 2017 Notes rank junior to our secured credit facility with Sterling National Bank. The 2017 Notes also include certain negative covenants including, without the investors’ approval, restrictions on dividends and other restricted payments and reclassification of its stock.    Future Sources of Liquidity     We expect our primary sources of cash to be customer collections and external financing. We also continue to work on cost reductions, and we have initiated steps to reduce our overhead to improve cash savings.  We may raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities or borrowings from financial institutions or third parties or a combination of the foregoing. Capital raised will be used to implement our business plan, grow current operations, make acquisitions or start new vertical businesses among some of the possible uses.     Accounts Receivable    Accounts receivable for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $8.9 million as compared to $8.0 million as on December 31, 2016. While Ameri California contributed $2.3 million to our accounts receivables in 2017, our accounts receivable did not increase by that amount due to a reduction in accounts receivable of our other subsidiaries.    Accounts Payable    Accounts payable for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.3 million as compared to $5.1 million as on December 31, 2016. While Ameri California contributed $1 million to our accounts payable in 2017, our accounts payable did not increase by that amount due to a reduction in accounts payable of our other subsidiaries.    Other Accrued Expenses    Accrued expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2.6 million as compared to $2.1 as on December 31, 2016. While Ameri California contributed $0.5 million to our accrued expenses in 2017, our accrued expenses did not increase by that amount due to a reduction in accrued expenses of our other subsidiaries.    Commitments and Contingencies    As of December 31, 2017, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments:             Payments due by period               Total          Less than  1 year          1-3 years          3+ years         Long-term debt obligations       $    1,880,114          $    749,551          $    1,130,563          $    -         Operating lease obligations          268,992             123,873             145,119             -         Total       $    2,149,106          $    873,424          $    1,275,682          $    -          Foreign Currency Risk    Overall, we believe that we have limited currency risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as most of our revenues are derived from customers located in North America.      38        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.    Seasonality    Our operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations. However, our consultants’ billable hours are affected by national holidays and vacation policies, which vary by country.    Climate Change    We do not believe there is anything unique to our business which would result in climate change regulations having a disproportional effect on us as compared to U.S. industry overall.    Impact of Inflation    We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, we attempt to minimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and, whenever possible, seeking to ensure that billing rates reflect increases in costs due to inflation.    Critical Accounting Policies    Revenue Recognition.  We recognize revenue in accordance with the Accounting Standard Codification 605 “Revenue Recognition.” Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the seller’s price to buyer is fixed and determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from information technology services as the services are provided. Service revenues are recognized based on contracted hourly rates, as services are rendered or upon completion of specified contracted services and acceptance by the customer.    Stock-Based Compensation.  Stock-based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and non-employee directors is determined based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. We recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.    Impairment.  Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, and certain other assets to be held and used by us, are reviewed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. If this assessment indicates that the carrying values will not be recoverable, as determined based on undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful lives, an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset.    Income Taxes.  We provide for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Tax benefits earned on employee stock awards in excess of recorded stock-based compensation expense are credited to additional paid-in capital. Our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related interest.    Accounts Receivable.  We extend credit to clients based upon management’s assessment of their credit-worthiness on an unsecured basis. We provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience and management evaluation of trend analysis. We include any balances that are determined to be uncollectible in allowance for doubtful accounts.    Business Combination.  We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires the identification of the acquirer, the determination of the acquisition date and the allocation of the purchase price paid by the acquirer to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.      39        Goodwill and Purchased Intangibles.  We evaluate goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. For purchased intangible assets, if our annual qualitative assessment indicates possible impairment, we test the assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of such assets to their carrying value. In determining the fair value, we utilize various estimates and assumptions, including discount rates and projections of future cash flows. If an impairment is indicated, a write down to the implied fair value of goodwill or fair value of intangible asset is recorded.    Valuation of Contingent Earn-out Consideration.  Acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on the achievement of certain future financial performance measures of the acquired company. Contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, however, there is significant judgment involved. We evaluate, on a routine, periodic basis, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration and changes in estimated fair value, subsequent to the initial fair value estimate at the time of the acquisition, will be reflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria. Any changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration may have a material impact on our operating results.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements      In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605).” This ASU requires an entity to recognize revenue when goods are transferred or services are provided to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), deferral of the Effective Date.” With the issuance of ASU 2015-14, the new revenue guidance ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, using one of two prescribed retrospective methods. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customer (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.” The guidance is applicable from the date of applicability of ASU 2014-09. This ASU finalizes the amendments to the guidance on the new revenue standard on the identification of performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements (Topic 606)” which is applicable from the date of applicability of ASU 2014-09. This guidance provides optional exemptions from the disclosure requirement for remaining performance obligations for specific situations in which an entity need not estimate variable consideration to recognize revenue. In May 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients”. This amendment clarified certain aspects of Topic 606 and will be applicable from the date of applicability of ASU 2014-09. We have adopted this accounting standard as of January 1, 2018 and we do not believe the new accounting standard will have a material impact on our financial statements.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. This new standard replaces the existing guidance on leases and requires the lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with lease terms equal to or greater than twelve months. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize total lease expense on a straight-line basis. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2018. Upon adoption, entities will be required to use a modified retrospective transition which provides for certain practical expedients. Entities are required to apply the new standard at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Early adoption of this new standard is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We do not expect the requirement to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for operating leases to have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated statements of financial position.    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Based on its current assessment, the Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.    On November 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which is intended to reduce diversity in the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. This new standard requires that restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included as components of total cash and cash equivalents as presented on the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years, but earlier adoption is permitted.  We do not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.      40          In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. Under this new standard, goodwill impairment would be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. This ASU eliminates existing guidance that requires an entity to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment test performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are in in process of evaluating the impact of these updates.    In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies and provides a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted for acquisition or deconsolidation transactions occurring before the issuance date or effective date and only when the transactions have not been reported in issued or made available for issuance financial statements. We do not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.        ITEM 7A.
