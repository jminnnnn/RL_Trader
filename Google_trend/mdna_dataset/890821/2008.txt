Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Executive Overview          Revenues increased to $751,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $333,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 216%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to a one time agreement extension of the licensing of Spatializer ®  audio signal processing algorithms. Revenues also reflect dormant licensing activity in 2007. As we sold all of our operating assets in 2007, we have no means to generate new revenues.        Net income was $807,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to net loss of $353,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the current period is primarily the result of the sale of assets, a one time licensing extension and lower operating expenses.        At December 31, 2007, we had $582,000 in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $229,000 at December 31, 2006. The increase in cash resulted primarily from the asset sale and stock sale. We also had $1,000,000 in a certificate of deposit at Citibank which matured in February 2007. We had working capital of $1,557,000 at December 31, 2007 as compared with working capital of $242,000 at December 31, 2006.    9                     We ceased operations in 2006 and sold substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, on July 2, 2007.    Approach to MD&A               The purpose of MD&A is to provide our shareholders and other interested parties with information necessary to gain an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. As such, we seek to satisfy three principal objectives:                        to provide a narrative explanation of a companys financial statements in plain English that enables the average investor to see the company through the eyes of management;                           to enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which financial information should be analyzed; and                           to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, a companys earnings and cash flow, so that investors can ascertain the likelihood and relationship of past performance being indicative of future performance.                    We believe the best way to achieve this is to give the reader:                        An understanding of our operating environment and its risks                           An outline of critical accounting policies                           A review of our corporate governance structure                           A review of the key components of the financial statements and our cash position and capital resources                           A review of the important trends in the financial statements and our cash flow                           Disclosure on our internal controls and procedures       Operating Environment          Our business environment was very competitive, which factor impacted us in various ways, some of which are discussed in greater detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. As a result, as previously disclosed, the Board of Directors decided in 2006 to cease operations and sell the assets of the Company and those of Desper Products, Inc. As a result of the consummation of that asset sale, the following risk factors became more relevant:                       The Company Has No Means to Generate Revenue                           The Amount of Any Cash Distribution to Stockholders is Undeterminable                           A New Management Group, Involved in the April 25, 2007 Stock Offering Is Anticipated to Take Control of the Company After the Cash Distribution, No Funding Source or Business Model Has Been Revealed. Existing Stockholders Likely Will be Diluted      In December 2005 our revenues were stagnant, with those from certain of our major customers winding down. Revenues from certain of our other customers appeared not to be sustainable in the future. In December 2005, two of our three independent directors resigned and the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary resigned from all positions held with the Company other than as a director, Chairman and Secretary. For these and other reasons, and after exploring other exit strategies and opportunities, our Board of Directors concluded in December 2005 to attempt to sell the Company either through a sale of assets or a sale of multiple, non-exclusive perpetual licenses with a subsequent sale of the residual assets and engaged Strategic Equity Group to assist us in this endeavor. After a long process of negotiation and stockholder approval, the assets were sold to a subsidiary of DTS, Inc on July 2, 2007. The transaction includes a nine month window within which DTS may file any claims for    10           breaches of our representations and warranties. Although we believe our representations and warranties to be true and complete, it is possible that an unforeseen claim may arise that could put financial demands on the Company.   We have had no source of revenue since the beginning of third quarter 2007. Based on current and projected operating levels, we do not believe that we can maintain our liquidity position at a consistent level, on a short-term or long-term basis, without a new business model and outside funding. As such, we intend to marshal our assets and satisfy liabilities and, after the contractual nine month indemnification period relating to the sale of assets on July 2, 2007, and distribute to our stockholders the remaining cash assets of the company, other than a $100,000 cash residual. While we expect there will be a distribution to stockholders, there is no assurance of the amount thereof or that there will be any remaining cash for distribution.   Even if we are diligent in marshalling our assets, the amount of the ultimate cash distribution, if any, is undeterminable. Unforeseen legal fees, creditors and other unasserted claims and or the cost of contacting stockholders and physically distributing the cash may be greater than anticipated. This will reduce or eliminate cash available for distribution.   Upon distribution of the cash assets, it is anticipated that each of Messrs. Mandell and Civelli will resign from the Board of Directors and the new investor group involved in the April 25, 2007 stock offering will take management control of the Company. Although there is no assurance thereof, the new investors in the Company may bring forth their own plan in the future regarding the direction of the Company. Should the new management believe it in the Companys and stockholders best interests to raise additional financing to pursue new business opportunities, such new financing is likely to dilute existing stockholders. Stockholders at the special meeting held on June 15, 2007 approved amending the Companys charter and gave the Board of Directors authority to affect a substantial reverse stock split at the time of its choosing and to increase the number of authorized common and preferred shares. While a new financing and new business model, if affected, could be successful, there is no assurance this will occur.    Critical Accounting Policies          Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In consultation with our Board of Directors and Audit Committee, we identified three accounting policies that we believe have historically been critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These are important accounting policies that require managements most difficult, subjective judgments. While these policies become much less relevant in the absence of revenue generating assets, they remain relevant in the review of prior period financial statements in this report and in understanding the residual revenue in the current quarter.        The first critical accounting policy relates to revenue recognition. Royalty revenues have been recognized upon shipment of products incorporating the related technology by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and foundries. These revenues were reported to us by our Licensees in formal, written royalty reports, which serve as the basis for our quarterly revenue accruals. Infrequently, certain written reports were received after our required reporting deadlines, sometimes due to contractual requirements. In such cases, management tried to obtain verbal reports or informal reports from the Licensee. In the absence of such information, management has utilized conservative estimates based on information received or historical trends. In such isolated cases, management strives to under-estimate such revenues to err on the side of caution. In the event such estimates are used, the revenue for the following quarter is adjusted based on receipt of the written report. In addition, any error in Licensee reporting, which is very infrequent, is adjusted in the subsequent quarter when agreed by both parties as correct.        The second critical accounting policy relates to research and development expenses. We expensed all research and development expenses as incurred. Costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of our algorithms (which is the primary component of our licensing) were expensed as incurred and included in Research and Development expenses. Such algorithms were refined based on customer requirements and licensed for inclusion in the customers specific product. There are no production costs to capitalize as defined in Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 86.             The third critical accounting policy relates to our long-lived assets. Substantially all of our assets were sold on July 2, 2007 at a net realized value in excess of carrying value. The Company has continually reviewed the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets using the methodology prescribed in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 144, Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company also reviewed long-lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Upon    11           such an occurrence, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows to which the assets relate, to the carrying amount. If the asset was determined to be unable to recover its carrying value, then intangible assets, if any, are written down first, followed by the other long-lived assets to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows, appraised values or managements estimates, depending on the nature of the assets. Our intangible assets consisted primarily of patents. We capitalized all costs directly attributable to patents and trademarks, consisting primarily of legal and filing fees, and amortize such costs over the remaining life of the asset (which range from 3 to 20 years) using the straight-line method. In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, only intangible assets with definite lives are amortized. Non-amortized intangible assets are instead subject to annual impairment testing. The gain on the sale of the Companys assets proves that the historical net carrying value of its assets exceeded the current carrying value.         Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Companys current circumstances, including the sale of all its revenue generating assets and significant operating losses, raise substantial doubt about the likelihood that the Company will continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   Key Components of the Financial Statements and Important Trends               The Companys financial statements, including the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity, should be read in conjunction with the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. MD&A explains the key components of each of these financial statements, key trends and reasons for reporting period-to-period fluctuations.              The Consolidated Balance Sheet provides a snapshot view of our financial condition at the end of our fiscal year. A balance sheet helps management and our stockholders understand the financial strength and capabilities of our business. Balance sheets can help identify and analyze trends, particularly in the area of receivables and payables. A review of cash balances compared to the prior years and in relation to ongoing profit or loss can show the ability of the Company to withstand business variations. The difference between Current Assets and Current Liabilities is referred to as Working capital and measures how much in liquid assets a company has available to build its business. Receivables that are substantially higher than revenue for the quarter may indicate a slowdown of collections, with an impact on future cash position. This is addressed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.               The Consolidated Statement of Operations tells the reader whether the Company had a profit or loss. It shows key sources of revenue and major expense categories. It is important to note period-to-period comparisons of each line item of this statement, reasons for any fluctuation and how costs are managed in relation to the overall revenue trend of the business. These statements are prepared using accrual accounting under generally accepted accounting standards in the United States. This is addressed further in MD&A under Revenues and Expenses.              The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows explains the actual sources and uses of cash. Some expenses of the Company, such as depreciation and amortization, do not result in a cash outflow in the current period, since the underlying patent expenditure or asset purchase was made years earlier. New capital expenditures, on the other hand, result in a disbursement of cash, but will be expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over their useful lives. Fluctuations in receivables and payables also explain why the net change in cash is not equal to the net loss reported on the Statement of Operations. Therefore, it is possible that the impact of a net loss on cash is less or more than the actual amount of the loss. This is discussed further in MD&A under Liquidity and Capital Resources.               The Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity shows the impact of the operating results on the Companys equity. In addition, this statement shows new equity brought into the Company through stock sales or stock option exercise. This is discussed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.     Results of Operations          The following discussion and analysis relates to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, and the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.   12              For the Year Ended December 31, 2007, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006                Revenues               Revenues increased to $751,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $333,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 216%. Revenues in 2007 were almost entirely comprised of a one time extension of an existing agreement pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer ®  audio signal processing algorithms.                   The increase in revenue resulted primarily from a one time extension in Q1 2007 of an existing licensing agreement in which the initial authorized usage had been exhausted and replenishment was necessary. This was partially offset by no revenue in the third and fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of the sale of the underlying technology assets.              Gross Profit               Gross profit increased to $687,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $332,000 in the comparable period last year, an increase of 107%. Gross margin was 91% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 99% of revenue for the comparable period last year. The increase in gross profit resulted from increased revenue, partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin declined due to a distributor commission paid on the extension contract. We maintained a high margin since revenues are from licensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated direct manufacturing or selling costs other than commissions paid to our independent representatives that solicit and oversee the particular accounts. All development costs are expensed as engineering and development expenses in the period they are incurred. In 2006, all major relationships with distributors had been terminated and no commissions were earned or payable. In 2007, we paid a commission on the license extension where the former distributor assisted us.               Operating Expenses               Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased to $433,000 (58% of sales) from $686,000 (206% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of 37%. The decrease in operating expenses resulted primarily from decreases in general and administrative expense, sales and marketing expense, and research and development expense due to the suspension of operations.               General and Administrative               General and administrative expense decreased to $433,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $527,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of 18%. The decrease is primarily due to discontinued general operating costs, partially offset by increased legal and accounting expenses related to public filings, in part in response to the additional requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. General operating costs include rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery, postage, depreciation and similar costs.               Research and Development               Research and development costs decreased to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in research and development expense was due to the elimination of an in-house applications engineering position and the resignation of the principal engineer in May 2006.               Sales and Marketing               Sales and marketing costs decreased to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $1,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in such expenses resulted from cessation of all licensing and marketing activities in January 2006 due to the suspension of operations.               Net Income (Loss)               Net income was $807,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to net loss of $353,000 for the year ended    13           December 31, 2006. The increased net income for the current period is primarily the result of the sale of assets and lower overhead.    For the Year Ended December 31, 2006, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005                Revenues               Revenues decreased to $333,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1,192,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 72%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer ®  audio signal processing algorithms.                   The decrease in revenue resulted partially from the absence of recognition of deferred revenue in the current year, as compared to 2005, in which a royalty advance received during 2004 was recognized. In addition, programs were not renewed or extended due to the termination of operations of the Company in January 2006. Existing revenues are derived from legacy licensing programs and are expected to wind down.              Gross Profit               Gross profit decreased to $332,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1,086,000 in the comparable period last year, an decrease of 69%. Gross margin was 99% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 91% of revenue for the comparable period last year. The decrease in gross profit resulted from lower revenues in fiscal 2006, partially offset by higher margins. We maintain a high margin since revenues are from licensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated direct manufacturing or selling costs other than commissions paid to our independent representatives that solicit and oversee the particular accounts. All development costs are expensed as engineering and development expenses in the period they are incurred. In 2006, all major relationships with distributors were terminated and no commissions were earned or payable.               Operating Expenses               Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased to $686,000 (206% of sales) from $1,177,000 (99% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 42%. The decrease in operating expenses resulted primarily from decreases in general and administrative expense, sales and marketing expense, and research and development expense due to the suspension of operations.               General and Administrative               General and administrative expense decreased to $527,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $670,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 21%. The decrease is primarily due to discontinued CEO travel and general operating costs, partially offset by increased legal and accounting expenses related to public filings, in part in response to the additional requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. General operating costs include rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery, postage, depreciation and similar costs.               Research and Development               Research and development costs decreased to $158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $354,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 55%. The decrease in research and development expense was due to the elimination of an in-house applications engineering position and the resignation of the principal engineer in May 2006.               Sales and Marketing               Sales and marketing costs decreased to $1,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $152,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 99%. The decrease in such expenses resulted from cessation of all licensing and marketing activities in January 2006 due to the suspension of operations.               Net Income (Loss)               The net loss was $353,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to net loss of $82,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increased net loss for the current period is primarily the result of lower revenue, partially offset by lower overhead.    14            Liquidity and Capital Resources               At December 31, 2007, we had $582,000 in cash and cash equivalents as compared to $229,000 at December 31, 2006. We also had a $1,000,000 certificate of deposit at Citibank. The increase in cash primarily resulted from the sale of assets and the sale of stock. We had working capital of $1,557,000 at December 31, 2007 as compared with working capital of $242,000 at December 31, 2006.              As previously disclosed, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, we sold substantially all of our assets and those of our wholly owned subsidiary, DPI (excluding certain assets, such as cash), to a wholly owned subsidiary of DTS, Inc. This transaction was approved by the stockholders on June 15, 2007 and was closed on July 2, 2007.              There is no current source of future cash flow for the Company as we sold substantially all of our audio assets and those of our wholly owned subsidiary, Desper Products, Inc., on July 2, 2007.              Based on current and projected operating levels, we do not believe that we can maintain our liquidity position at a consistent level, on a short-term or long-term basis, without a new business model and outside funding. As such, we intend to marshal our assets and after a contractual nine month indemnification period relating to the sale of assets on July 2, 2007, we will distribute the remaining cash assets of the company, after satisfying liabilities and leaving a $100,000 cash residual. Upon distribution of the cash assets, it is anticipated that each of Messrs. Mandell and Civelli will resign from the Board of Directors and the new investor group involved in the April 25, 2007 stock offering will take management control of the Company. Although there is no assurance thereof, the new investors in the Company may bring forth their own plan in the future regarding the direction of the Company, including new, revenue generating businesses.              In September 2006, the Company and DPI entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with DTS, Inc. and a wholly owned subsidiary thereof pursuant to which we agreed to sell substantially all of our assets (other than certain excluded assets, such as cash). The consummation of the asset sale was subject to approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company. In April 2007, the Company sold an aggregate of 16,236,615 shares of its Common Stock to certain investors.              The Company held a special meeting of stockholders on June 15, 2007 to vote on the asset sale transaction but not with respect to the dissolution of the Company. The asset sale transaction was approved. The asset sale transaction closed on July 2, 2007. There is no assurance that there will be any funds available for distribution to stockholders.    Net Operating Loss Carryforwards               At December 31, 2007, we had net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately $26,000,000 which are available to offset future Federal taxable income, if any, through 2015. Approximately $21,700,000 of these net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $1,000,000.    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements               In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements . SFAS 157 replaces the different definitions of fair value in the accounting literature with a single definition. It defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 is effective for fair-value measurements already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of SFAS 157 on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.              In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of SFAS 159 apply only to entities that elect the fair value    15           option; however, the amendment to FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of SFAS 157 on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.       Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    We have not been exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on our short-term investments at December 31, 2007. A hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in interest rate (ten percent of our overall earnings rate) would not result in a material fluctuation in future earnings or cash flow. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or for speculative purposes and we are not currently evaluating the future use of such financial instruments.    16               Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
