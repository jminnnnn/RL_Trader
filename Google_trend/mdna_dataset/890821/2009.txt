Business  Overview   SpatializerAudio Laboratories, Inc. (“Spatializer” or the “Company”) had been a developer,licensor and marketer of next generation technologies for the consumerelectronics, personal computing, entertainment and cellular telephone markets.Our technology was incorporated into products offered by our licensees andcustomers on various economic and business terms. We were incorporated in theState of Delaware in February 1994 and are the successor company through aPlan of Arrangement pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Spatializer, apublicly held Yukon, Canada corporation, were exchanged for an equal number ofshares of our common stock. Our corporate office is located at 410 Park Avenue- -- 15 th  Floor ,New York, New York 10022.     TheCompany’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Desper Products, Inc. (“DPI” or “DesperProducts”), had been in the business of developing proprietary advanced audiosignal processing technologies and products for consumer electronics,entertainment and multimedia computing. All Company revenues were generated fromthis subsidiary. Desper Products was the owner of all technology which wasacquired by DTS, Inc. on July 2, 2007. Desper Products was a Californiacorporation incorporated in June 1986 and dissolved on December 5,2008.     Copies ofthis Annual Report, including our financial statements, and our quarterlyreports on Form 10-Q as well as other corporate information, including pressreleases, of interest to our stockholders are available by writing us at 410Park Avenue -- 15 th Floor,  New York, New York 10022.   Backgroundof the Sale of Assets and Dissolution   Spatializerhad been under acute market pressure since 2002. In 2002, a personal computeraccount began migrating to a totally new operating system which did not includeany audio enhancements. The migration was completed in 2003 and the formerlicensee chose not to include any audio software enhancements, including thosefrom Spatializer. This account had accounted for approximately 40% ofSpatializer’s annual revenues.           3           In 2003,Spatializer experienced declining revenue from its’ three major customers,primarily from the curtailment or cessation of use of its products by thesecustomers. Two of these cases were in the DVD player market where Spatializerhistorically had been strong. During 2003, the DVD player market became largelycommoditized, resulting in intense pricing pressure and a steep decline in priceand margins. Manufacturers were forced to strip out features, such as thoseoffered by Spatializer, in order to compete. One of Spatializer’s accountsswitched to outside sourcing and Spatializer was able to expand its relationshipwith their supplier to recapture most of that revenue. However, a major newdesign win Spatializer was projecting for the DVD market was cancelled due tothese cost constraints.     In 2004,the revenue mix by licensee platform was significantly different compared to theprior year. The decrease in revenue on the DVD and personal computer accountspreviously discussed generated approximately 56% of total fiscal 2003 revenuewhich was lost in 2004. These losses were partially offset by three new revenuesources in cellular phones, mobile audio semiconductors and personal computersand the expansion of an existing license relating to recordable DVD. Cellularphone, mobile audio and the personal computer markets had been targeted bySpatializer for replacing the losses in the DVD player category. Nevertheless,market pressures mounted and Spatializer was forced to substantially reduceoverhead in order to remain liquid.     OnDecember 19, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting, Spatializer’s board ofdirectors discussed its’ current financial outlook. Management indicated to theboard of directors that two customers, the revenues from which accounted forapproximately 70% of Spatializer’s income during 2005, would not be sustainablein 2006.  This called intoquestion the ability of the Company to operate as a going concern . TheCompany’s financial statements have been prepared assuming that it wouldcontinue as a going concern.     Aspreviously reported, on September 18, 2006, the Company and DPI enteredinto an Asset Purchase Agreement with DTS, Inc. and a wholly-owned subsidiarythereof pursuant to which the Company and DPI agreed to sell substantially allof their intellectual property assets. A special stockholders meeting was calledfor January 24, 2007 to approve sale of assets and to authorize thedissolution of the Company. Proxies were mailed on or about December 1,2006. The Board adjourned the meeting without a final vote in for reasons itbelieved to be in the best interest of the stockholders. The meeting wasreconvened on February 21, 2007. The vote required to approve the assetsale and dissolution was a majority of the shares outstanding on the recorddate. The dissolution proposal was contingent upon approval of the asset sale. Atotal of 1,533,452 shares voted on the asset sale proposal, of which 1,440,708shares were voted in favor, 82,318 shares voted against and 10,424 votesabstained. Although the votes cast on the proposal to sell the assets wasoverwhelmingly in favor thereof, the requisite vote was not obtained. As aresult, the proposal regarding dissolution was not presented to a vote ofstockholders.     OnApril 25, 2007, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement datedApril 25, 2007, the Company sold to a group of investors, in a privatetransaction, an aggregate of 1,623,661 shares for an aggregate purchase price of$422,152, of which $259,786 was placed into escrow and was released ten daysafter the closing of the sale of assets to DTS.     TheCompany re-solicited a vote on the sale of assets to DTS in the second quarterof 2007. The Asset Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereinwere approved by the stockholders of the Company at a special meeting onJune 15, 2007. The Asset Purchase Agreement was consummated with DTS onJuly 2, 2007. Upon the conclusion of a nine month indemnification period,the Company distributed $0.21/share, substantially all of its remaining cashassets, to its stockholders, after satisfying its liabilities and leaving anapproximate $100,000 cash residual.  The Company has no plans todissolve.     Thecompany effectuated a 1 for 10 reverse split during the fiscal year 2008,resulting in 6,500,000 outstanding shares vs. 65,000,000 at the end of fiscal2007.     Ourfinancial statements contain information relating to our revenues, loss andtotal assets for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.   LicensingActivities   We ceasedall licensing activities in 2007 and all material license agreements were soldto DTS, Inc. on July 2, 2007.  As ofJuly 2, 2007, the date of the asset sale, our technology had beenincorporated in products offered by more than 105 separate OEM Licensees andcustomers on various economic and business terms. Some of these OEM Licensesrequired a license issuance fee and/or a separate per unit royalty, while otherswere licensed under the Logo Usage Agreement (“LUA”) or were authorizedcustomers under bundled royalty licenses.           4           In 2007,two major customers, Sharp and Samsung, presented in no particular order ofimportance, each accounted for 10% or more of our total royalty revenues. OneOEM accounted for 83% and one accounted for 12% of our royalty revenues during2007. All other OEMs accounted for less than 5% of royalty revenuesindividually.   Customers,Revenues and Expenses   Wegenerated revenues in our audio business from royalties pursuant to our OEM andother licenses, and from non-recurring engineering fees to port our technologiesto specific licensees’ applications. Our royalty revenues, which totaled$750,000 in 2007, were derived entirely from Foundry and OEM license fees androyalties.     Historically,we sought to maximize return on our intellectual property base by concentratingour efforts in higher margin licensing and software products and eliminating ourhardware product operations. Licensing operations have been managed internallyby our personnel and through use of an international sales representativeforce.     In 2007,revenues increased as compared with the prior year due to a one time extensionof an existing license agreement in which the initial authorized usage had beenexhausted and replenishment was necessary.   With the sale ofassets described above, revenues declined to $0.   Competition   Wecompeted with a number of entities that produce various audio enhancementprocesses, technologies and products, some utilizing traditional two-speakerplayback, others utilizing multiple speakers, and others restricted to headphonelistening. These include the consumer versions of multiple speakers, matrix anddiscrete digital technologies developed for theatrical motion picture exhibition(like Dolby Digital  ®  , DolbyProLogic  ® , and DTS  ®  ), aswell as other technologies designed to create an enhanced stereo image from twoor more speakers.     Ourprincipal competitors in the field of virtual audio were SRS Labs, Inc. andDolby Laboratories, Inc. In addition, some DSP foundries and OEMs haveproprietary virtual audio technologies that they regularly offer to OEMs at nocost. These companies had substantially greater resources than us to devote tofurther technologies and new product developments.     We wereunable to compete in this market, even though we offered a single source,complete suite of patented and proprietary 3D Stereo, interactive positional,virtual surround sound, headphone and speaker virtualization technologies. Welacked sufficient financial resources to compete, our customers were too strong,we were closely dependent on third party licensee marketing plans whichgenerally presented a longer or uncertain revenue stream than our cash resourcescould support and found the market less receptive to our value proposition thanwe had expected. This resulted in an inhospitable market for our products and wecould not compete.   Researchand Development   Ourresearch and development expenditures in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately0%, 0% and 23% of total operating expenses, respectively. These expensesconsisted of salaries and related costs of employees and consultants engaged inongoing research, design and development activities and costs for engineeringmaterials and supplies.     FromMay 2006 onward, we had no employees in our R&D group, based on ourboard of directors’ decision to offer our assets for sale. We discontinued ourtechnology development in December 2005 and support efforts inMay 2006 when the sole engineer resigned. As a result, there were no suchexpenditures in 2007 or 2008.         5           IntellectualProperty and Proprietary Information   We reliedon a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and services,including patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and contractualobligations. All of our intellectual property was sold to DTS, Inc. onJuly 2, 2007.   Employees   We began2008 with no full time employees and one part time employee and ended 2008 withno full time employees and three part time employees.   Item 1A.  Risk Factors   ThisAnnual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within themeaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, reflectingmanagement’s current expectations. Examples of such forward-looking statementsinclude our expectations with respect to our strategy. Although we believe thatour expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions, there can be noassurances that our financial goals or any transactions described herein will berealized. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performanceor achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any futureresults, performance or achievements expressed or implied by suchforward-looking statements. Numerous factors may affect our actual results andmay cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-lookingstatements made by or on behalf of our company. For this purpose, any statementscontained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to beforward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words,“believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects” and similar expressions areintended to identify forward-looking statements. The important factors discussedunder the caption “Factors That May Affect Future Results” in Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations, herein, among others, would cause actual results to differmaterially from those indicated by forward-looking statements made herein andrepresent management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain.Investors are warned that actual results may differ from management’sexpectations. We assume no obligation to update the forward-looking informationto reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting suchforward-looking information.     Ourbusiness environment was very competitive, which impacted us in various ways,namely to cease operations and sell the assets of the Company and those ofDesper Products, Inc. As a result of the consummation of that asset sale, thefollowing risk factors became more relevant:   TheCompany Has No Means to Generate Revenue   We haveno source of revenue. After the contractual nine month indemnification periodrelating to the sale of assets on July 2, 2007, we distributed the remainingcash assets of the company, other than an approximate $100,000 cash residual, inApril 2008. This cash balance has been further diminished during the remainderof 2008 by general and administrative expenses.   ANew Management Group, Involved in the April 25, 2007 Stock Offering,Took  Control of the Company After the Cash Distribution; No FundingSource or Business Model Has Been Revealed. Existing Stockholders Likely Will beDiluted   Upondistribution of the cash assets, each of Messrs. Mandell and Civelliresigned from the Board of Directors and the new investor group involved in theApril 25, 2007 stock offering took control of the management of theCompany. Although there is no assurance thereof, the new investors in theCompany may bring forth their own plan in the future regarding the direction ofthe Company. Should management believe it is in the Company’s and stockholders’best interests to raise additional financing to pursue new businessopportunities,  new financing is likely to dilute existingstockholders. Stockholders at the special meeting held on June 15, 2007approved amending the Company’s charter and gave the Board of Directorsauthority to affect a substantial reverse stock split at the time of itschoosing and to increase the number of authorized common and preferred shares.While a new financing and new business model, if effected, could be successful,there is no assurance this will occur or, if it occurs, that it would besuccessful.         6           TheMarket For Our Stock Is Not Liquid And The Stock Price Is Subject ToVolatility   Our stockis quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, where low trading volume and highvolatility is often experienced. While a few firms make a market in our stock,the historically low trading volume and relatively few market makers of ourstock makes it more likely that a severe fluctuation in volume, either up ordown, will significantly impact the stock price. There can be no assurance thatthese market makers will continue to quote our stock and a reduction in suchmarket makers would negatively impact trading liquidity. Further, with ourconstrained resources and increased cost and time associated with implementationof Sarbanes-Oxley, it may not be possible for us to remain listed on the OTCBulletin Board in the future as a fully reporting company. Lastly, theuncertainty of the future of the Company may limit the liquidity of our stock.This and the existing limited market and volume in the trading of our stock, mayresult in our stockholders having difficulty selling our common stock. Thetrading price of our Common Stock has been, and will likely continue to be,subject to wide fluctuations in response to possible claims arising from ourasset sale, the uncertainty of the future of the Company, general marketfluctuations and other events and factors, some of which may be beyond ourcontrol.   Item 1B.  Unresolved StaffComments   Registrantis in receipt of comments from the SEC Staff regarding Form 10-K for the yearended December 31, 2007 and the three Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters in2008.  Those comments are being addressed concurrently and will be thesubject of amended filings to be made as expeditiously aspossible.  Registrant believes that any Staff comments outstandinghave been addressed in this 2008 Form 10-K and wanted to file this annual reporton as timely a basis as possible.   Item 2 .  Properties   Ourcorporate office and research center in San Jose, California was the primarylocation for our audio technology division, Desper Products, Inc. We occupiedapproximately 1,300 square feet with an annual rent on a full service basis ofapproximately $26,275 in calendar 2006. The lease expired on December 31,2006 and, based upon the decision to try to sell the Company’s assets, was notrenewed. We leased our space at rental rates and on terms which managementbelieved were consistent with those available for similar space in theapplicable local area. Such property was well maintained and adequate to supportour requirements. We have no leased facilities as of December 31,2008.   Item 3.  LegalProceedings   From timeto time we were involved in various disputes and litigation matters arising inthe normal course of business. As of the date of this Form 10-K Annual Report,we are not involved in any legal proceedings.   Item 4.

Stockholders are urged to obtain current market prices forour Common Stock. Corporate Stock Transfer is our transfer agent andregistrar.  The Company had a 1 for 10 reverse split of its stock onNovember 21, 2008, which split is reflected in the above table. Likewise, shareand per share data disclosed in the remainder of this report have been restatedto reflect the results of this split, unless otherwise noted.  To ourknowledge, because most shares are held in street name, there were approximately200 holders of record of the stock of the Company as of March 25, 2009. Ourtransfer agent has indicated that beneficial ownership is believed to be inexcess of 2,000 stockholders.  Otherthan the $0.21 cash distribution in April 2008, we have not paid any cashdividends on our Common Stock and have no present intention of paying anydividends. Our current policy is to retain earnings, if any, for operations inconnection with selling the Company as a shell corporation, maintain our statusas a reporting company and/or merge the Company successfully into a newoperating business.  Our future dividend policy will be determinedfrom time to time by the Board of Directors.  TheCompany did not repurchase any of its equity securities during the fourthquarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.         8           Item 6.  Selected FinancialData              NotAppricable  Item 7. Management’s Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ExecutiveOverview     There wasno revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $751,000 for theyear ended December 31, 2007 (due to a one time extension of a thenexisting licensing agreement as described above in “Customers, Revenues andExpenses”). As we sold all of our operating assets in 2007, we have no means togenerate new revenues.     Net losswas $144,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to net income of$807,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007.     AtDecember 31, 2008, we had $67,000 in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to$582,000 at December 31, 2007. We had working capital of $48,000 atDecember 31, 2008 as compared with working capital of $1,557,000 atDecember 31, 2007.     We ceasedoperations in 2006 and sold substantially all of our assets, including ourintellectual property, on July 2, 2007.     Ourcurrent policy is to retain earnings, if any, for operations in connection withselling the Company as a shell corporation, maintain our status as a reportingcompany and/or merge the Company successfully into a new operatingbusiness.   Approachto MD&A   Thepurpose of MD&A is to provide our shareholders and other interested partieswith information necessary to gain an understanding of our financial condition,changes in financial condition and results of operations. As such, we seek tosatisfy three principal objectives:                •             to      provide a narrative explanation of a company’s financial statements “in      plain English” that enables the average investor to see the company      through the eyes of management;                                                     •             to      enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within      which financial information should be analyzed; and                                                     •             to      provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, a      company’s earnings and cash flow, so that investors can ascertain the      likelihood and relationship of past performance being indicative of future      performance.                           9           Webelieve the best way to achieve this is to give the reader:                •             An      understanding of our operating environment and itsrisks                                                     •             An      outline of critical accounting policies                                                     •             A      review of our corporate governance structure                                                     •             A      review of the key components of the financial statements and our cash      position and capital resources                                                     •             A      review of the important trends in the financial statements and our cash      flow                                                     •             Disclosure      on our internal controls andprocedures       OperatingEnvironment   Ourbusiness environment was very competitive, which factor impacted us in variousways, some of which are discussed in greater detail in our Annual Reports onForm 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007,respectively. As a result, as previously disclosed, the Board of Directorsdecided in 2006 to cease operations and sell the assets of the Company and thoseof Desper Products, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiary. (See Item 1above.)     InDecember 2005, our revenues were stagnant, with those from certain of ourmajor customers winding down. Revenues from certain of our other customersappeared not to be sustainable in the future. In December 2005, two of ourthree independent directors resigned and our Chairman of the Board, ChiefExecutive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary resigned from allpositions held with the Company other than as a director, Chairman andSecretary. For these and other reasons, and after exploring other exitstrategies and opportunities, our Board of Directors concluded inDecember 2005 to attempt to sell the Company either through a sale ofassets or a sale of multiple, non-exclusive perpetual licenses with a subsequentsale of the residual assets and engaged Strategic Equity Group to assist us inthis endeavor. After a long process of negotiation and stockholder approval, theassets were sold to a subsidiary of DTS, Inc on July 2, 2007 as describedin Item 1 above.                Wehave had no source of revenue since the beginning of third quarter 2007. Basedon current and projected operating levels, we do not believe that we canmaintain our liquidity position at a consistent level, on a short-term orlong-term basis, without a new business model and outside funding. Wedistributed to our stockholders the remaining cash assets of the Company, otherthan an approximate $100,000 cash residual, since reduced to approximately$67,000 as of December 31, 2008.   CriticalAccounting Policies   Thisdiscussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations arebased upon our consolidated statements, which have been prepared in accordancewith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Thepreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates andjudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues andexpenses based on historical experience and various other factors that arebelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differfrom these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In consultationwith our board of directors and Audit Committee, we identified three accountingpolicies that we believe have historically been critical to an understanding ofour financial statements. These important accounting policies requiremanagement’s most difficult, subjective judgments. While these policies becomemuch less relevant in the absence of revenue generating assets, they remainrelevant in the review of prior period financial statements in this report andin understanding the residual revenue in the current period.           10           The firstcritical accounting policy relates to revenue recognition. Royalty revenues havebeen recognized upon shipment of products incorporating the related technologyby the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and foundries. These revenueswere reported to us by our Licensees in formal, written royalty reports.Infrequently, certain written reports were received after our required reportingdeadlines, sometimes due to contractual requirements. In such cases, managementtried to obtain verbal reports or informal reports from the Licensee. In theabsence of such information, management had utilized estimates based oninformation received or historical trends. This information is not relevant inthe current period.  In such isolated cases, management strives tounder-estimate such revenues to err on the side of caution. In the event suchestimates are used, the revenue for the following quarter is adjusted based onreceipt of the written report. In addition, any error in Licensee reporting,which is very infrequent, is adjusted in the subsequent quarter when bothparties agree as correct.  Thesecond critical accounting policy relates to research and development expenses.We expensed all research and development expenses as incurred. Costs incurred toestablish the technological feasibility of our algorithms (which is the primarycomponent of our licensing) were expensed as incurred and included in Researchand Development expenses. Such algorithms were refined based on customerrequirements and licensed for inclusion in the customer’s specific product.There are no production costs to capitalize as defined in Statement on FinancialAccounting Standards No. 86.     The thirdcritical accounting policy relates to our long-lived assets. Substantially allof our assets were sold on July 2, 2007 at a net realized value in excessof carrying value. The Company has continually reviewed the recoverability ofthe carrying value of long-lived assets using the methodology prescribed inStatement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 144, “Accounting for theImpairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The Company also reviewedlong-lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment wheneverevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of suchassets may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of theseassets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows towhich the assets relate, to the carrying amount. If the asset was determined tobe unable to recover its carrying value, then intangible assets, if any, arewritten down first, followed by the other long-lived assets to fair value. Fairvalue is determined based on discounted cash flows, appraised values ormanagement’s estimates, depending on the nature of the assets. Our intangibleassets consisted primarily of patents. We capitalized all costs directlyattributable to patents and trademarks, consisting primarily of legal and filingfees, and amortize such costs over the remaining life of the asset (which rangefrom 3 to 20 years) using the straight-line method. In accordance with SFAS142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, only intangible assets withdefinite lives are amortized. Non-amortized intangible assets are insteadsubject to annual impairment testing. The gain on the sale of the Company’sassets established that the historical net carrying value of its assets exceededthe current carrying value.     Our unaudited and audited financialstatements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a goingconcern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company’scurrent circumstances, including the sale of all its revenue generating assetsand significant operating losses, raise substantial doubt about the likelihoodthat the Company will continue as a going concern. The financial statements donot include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of thisuncertainty .   KeyComponents of the Financial Statements and Important Trends   TheCompany’s financial statements, including the Consolidated Balance Sheets, theConsolidated Statements of Operations, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flowsand the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity, should be read inconjunction with the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. MD&Aexplains the key components of each of these financial statements, key trendsand reasons for reporting period-to-period fluctuations.     TheConsolidated Balance Sheet provides a snapshot view of our financial conditionat the end of our latest fiscal year. A balance sheet helps management and ourstockholders understand the financial strength and capabilities of ourbusiness.  Balance sheets can help identify and analyze trends,particularly in the area of receivables and payables. A review of cash balancescompared to the prior years and in relation to ongoing profit or loss can showthe ability of the Company to withstand business variations. The differencebetween Current Assets and Current Liabilities is referred to as Working Capitaland measures how much in liquid assets a company has available to build itsbusiness. Receivables that are substantially higher than revenue for the quartermay indicate a slowdown of collections, with an impact on future cash position.This is addressed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and CapitalResources.           11           TheConsolidated Statement of Operations tells the reader whether the Company had aprofit or loss. It shows key sources of revenue and major expense categories. Itis important to note period-to-period comparisons of each line item of thisstatement, reasons for any fluctuation and how costs are managed in relation tothe overall revenue trend of the business. These statements are prepared usingaccrual accounting under generally accepted accounting standards in the UnitedStates. This is addressed further in MD&A under Revenues andExpenses.     TheConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows explains the actual sources and uses ofcash. Some expenses of the Company, such as depreciation and amortization, donot result in a cash outflow in the current period, since the underlying patentexpenditure or asset purchase was made years earlier. New capital expenditures,on the other hand, result in a disbursement of cash, but will be expensed in theConsolidated Statement of Operations over their useful lives. Fluctuations inreceivables and payables also explain why the net change in cash is not equal tothe net loss reported on the Statement of Operations. Therefore, it is possiblethat the impact of a net loss on cash is less or more than the actual amount ofthe loss. This is discussed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and CapitalResources.     TheConsolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity shows the impact ofthe operating results on the Company’s equity. In addition, this statement showsnew equity brought into the Company through stock sales or stock optionexercise. This is discussed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and CapitalResources.   Resultsof Operations   Thefollowing discussion and analysis relates to our results of operations for theyear ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31,2007, and the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year endedDecember 31, 2006. The following discussion should be read in conjunctionwith the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewherein this report.   ContinuingOperations   For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2008, Compared to the Year Ended December 31,2007   Revenues   Therewere no revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 and no revenues fromcontinuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to thesuspension of operations as described in item 1 above.     OperatingExpenses          Operating expenses for continuing operations for the year ended December 31,2008 decreased to $151,000 from $210,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, adecrease of 28%. The decrease in operating expenses resulted from adecrease in general and administrative expense due to the suspension ofoperations. This total is primarily general operating costs, includingtelephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and postage.   Income(Loss) from Continuing Operations   The lossfrom continuing operations was $144,000 for the year ended December 31,2008, compared to a loss of $172,000 for the year ended December 31,2007.   For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2007, Compared to the Year Ended December 31,2006         12           Revenues   Therewere no revenues from continuing operations for the years endedDecember 31, 2007 and  December 31, 2006.   OperatingExpenses   `        Operating expenses for continuing operations for the year endedDecember 31, 2007 decreased to $210,000  from$227,000  for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of 7%.The decrease in operating expenses resulted from a decrease in general andadministrative expense. The decrease is primarily due to a decline in generaloperating costs, partially offset by increased legal and accounting expensesrelated to public filings, in part in response to the additional requirementsimposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. General operating costsinclude rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery,postage, depreciation and similar costs.   Income(Loss) from Continuing Operations   The lossfrom continuing operations was $172,000 for the year ended December 31,2007, compared to a loss of $226,000 for the year ended December 31,2006.   DiscontinuedOperations   For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2008, Compared to the Year Ended December 31,2007   Revenues   Therewere no revenues from discontinued operations for the year endedDecember 31, 2008 compared to $751,000 for the year ended December 31,2007, due to the suspension of operations as described in item 1above.   GrossProfit   There wasno gross profit from discontinued operations for the year endedDecember 31, 2008 compared to $687,000 in the comparable period lastyear,  due to thesuspension of operations as described in Item 1 above . Gross margin was99% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2007.  OperatingExpenses   Operatingexpenses for discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008decreased to $0 from $223,000 (30% of sales) for the year ended December 31,2007, a decrease of 100%. The decrease in operating expenses resultedprimarily from decreases in general and administrative expense due to thesuspension of operations.   Generaland Administrative   Generaland administrative expense for discontinued operations decreased to $0 for theyear ended December 31, 2008 from $223,000 for the year endedDecember 31, 2007, a decrease of 100%. The decrease is primarily due to adecline in general operating costs, including telephone, legal, public filing,office supplies and postage and similar costs.   Researchand Development   Researchand development costs for discontinued operations were $0 for the year endedDecember 31, 2008, compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2007due to the suspension of operations as described in Item 1 above.         13           Salesand Marketing   Sales andmarketing costs for discontinued operations were $0 for the year endedDecember 31, 2008, compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2007due to the suspension of operations as described in Item 1 above.   Income(Loss) from Discontinued Operations   The lossfrom discontinued operations was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2008,compared to income of $979,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Thedifference is due to the absence of revenues in 2008, the sale of assets in 2007and the suspension of operations as described in Item 1 above.   For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2007, Compared to the Year Ended December 31,2006   Revenues          Revenues from discontinued operations increased to $751,000 for the year endedDecember 31, 2007 compared to $333,000 for the year ended December 31,2006, an increase of 216%. Revenues in 2007 were almost entirely comprised of aone time extension of an existing agreement pertaining to the licensing of theCompany’s Spatializer   audiosignal processing algorithms. The increase in revenue resulted primarily from aone time extension in Q1 2007 of an existing licensing agreement in which theinitial authorized usage had been exhausted and replenishment was necessary.This was partially offset by no revenue in the third and fourth quarter of 2007as a result of the sale of the underlying technology assets.   GrossProfit   Grossprofit from discontinued operations increased to $687,000 for the year endedDecember 31, 2007 from $332,000 in the comparable 2006 period, an increaseof 107%. Gross margin was 91% of revenue in the year ended December 31,2006 compared with 99% of revenue for the 2007 comparable period. The increasein gross profit resulted from increased revenue, partially offset by lower grossmargin. Gross margin declined due to a distributor commission paid on theextension contract. We maintained a high margin since revenues are fromlicensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated directmanufacturing or selling costs other than commissions paid to our independentrepresentatives that solicit and oversee the particular accounts. Alldevelopment costs were expensed as engineering and development expenses in theperiod incurred. In 2006, all major relationships with distributors had beenterminated and no commissions were earned or payable in 2007. In 2007, we paid acommission on the license extension where the former distributor assisted us,but none in 2008.   OperatingExpenses   Operatingexpenses for discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007decreased to $223,000 (30% of sales) from $459,000 (138% of sales) for the yearended December 31, 2006, a decrease of 51%. The decrease in operatingexpenses resulted primarily from decreases in general and administrativeexpense, sales and marketing expense, and research and development expense dueto the suspension of operations.   Generaland Administrative   Generaland administrative expense for discontinued operations decreased to $223,000 forthe year ended December 31, 2007 from $300,000 for the year endedDecember 31, 2006, a decrease of 26%. The decrease is primarily due to adecrease in general operating costs as a result of the decline in the Company’ssales activity.         14           Researchand Development   Researchand development costs for discontinued operations decreased to $0 for the yearended December 31, 2007, compared to $158,000 for the year endedDecember 31, 2006. The decrease in research and development expense was dueto the elimination of an in-house applications engineering position and theresignation of the principal engineer in May 2006.   Salesand Marketing   Sales andmarketing costs for discontinued operations decreased to $0 for the year endedDecember 31, 2007, compared to $1,000 for the year ended December 31,2006. The decrease in such expenses resulted from cessation of all licensing andmarketing activities in January 2006 due to the suspension ofoperations.   Income(Loss) from Discontinued Operations   Theincome from discontinued operations was $979,000 for the year endedDecember 31, 2007, compared to a loss of $127,000 for the year endedDecember 31, 2006. The increased net income for the current period isprimarily the result of the sale of assets and lower overhead due to thesuspension of operations.   Liquidityand Capital Resources   AtDecember 31, 2008, we had $66,800 in cash and cash equivalents as comparedto $582,000 at December 31, 2007. The decrease in cash primarily resultedfrom the distribution of $1,365,000 or $0.21/share during 2008. We had workingcapital of $48,000 at December 31, 2008 as compared with working capital of$1,557,000 at December 31, 2007.     Aspreviously disclosed, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, we soldsubstantially all of our assets and those of our wholly-owned subsidiary, DPI(excluding certain assets, such as cash), to a wholly-owned subsidiary of DTS,Inc. This transaction was approved by the stockholders on June 15, 2007,and was closed on July 2, 2007.     There isno current source of future cash flow for the Company as we sold substantiallyall of our audio assets and those of our wholly-owned subsidiary, DesperProducts, Inc., on July 2, 2007.     Based oncurrent and projected operating levels, we do not believe that we can maintainour liquidity position at a consistent level, on a short-term or long-termbasis, without a new business model and outside funding. We distributed theremaining cash assets of the company, after satisfying liabilities and leavingan approximately $100,000 cash residual. Upon distribution of the cash assets,Messrs. Mandell and Civelli resigned from the Board of Directors and thenew investor group involved in the April 25, 2007 stock offering tookmanagement control of the Company. Although there is no assurance thereof, thenew investors in the Company may bring forth their own plan in the futureregarding the direction of the Company, including new, revenue generatingbusinesses.     InSeptember 2006, the Company and DPI entered into an Asset PurchaseAgreement with DTS, Inc. and a wholly owned subsidiary thereof pursuant to whichwe agreed to sell substantially all of our assets (other than certain excludedassets, such as cash). The consummation of the asset sale was subject toapproval of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Common Stockof the Company. In April 2007, the Company sold an aggregate of 16,236,615shares (1,623,662 shares after the 1-for-10 reverse stock split effected inDecember, 2008) of its Common Stock to certain investors.     TheCompany held a special meeting of stockholders on June 15, 2007 to vote onthe asset sale transaction but not with respect to the dissolution of theCompany.

The asset sale transactionclosed on July 2, 2007.  $0.21/share, or $1,365,000, wasdistributed to shareholders in April 2008 upon completion of a 270 day escrowperiod.           15           Ourcurrent policy is to retain earnings, if any, for operations in connection withselling the Company as a shell corporation, maintain our status as a reportingcompany and/or merge the Company successfully into a new operatingbusiness.   NetOperating Loss Carryforwards   At December 31, 2008, we had netoperating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately$26,150,000 which are available to offset future Federal taxable income, if any,through 2015. Approximately $21,700,000 of these net operating losscarryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $1,000,000.Utilization of these loss carryforwards is subject to further limitation as aresult of change in ownership of the Company, as defined by Federal taxlaw.     Item 7A.  Quantitative and QualitativeDisclosures About Market Risk   We arenot exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changesin interest rates at December 31, 2008 because of our suspension ofoperations. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments tomanage interest rate risk or for speculative purposes and we are not currentlyevaluating the future use of such financial instruments.
