Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Executive Overview               Revenues decreased to $333,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1,192,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 72%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer ®  audio signal processing algorithms. A key issue discussed is the wind-down of revenue streams in fiscal 2006 due to the discontinuation of operations. Revenues also reflect dormant licensing activity in 2006.              Net loss was $353,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to net loss of $82,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net loss for the current period is primarily the result of lower revenue, partially offset by lower overhead. A key issue discussed is managements efforts to reduce overhead in view of declining revenue, and to marshal cash.              At December 31, 2006, we had $229,000 in cash and cash equivalents as compared to $551,000 at December 31, 2005. The decrease in cash resulted primarily from the net loss. We had working capital of $242,000 at December 31, 2006 as compared with working capital of $560,000 at December 31, 2005.    16                   We ceased operations in 2006 and are winding the company down based on a proposed sale of our intellectual property and other assets, which requires majority stockholder approval. While votes received were overwhelmingly in favor of the asset sale, a required majority of stockholders failed to vote affirmatively. The Board is considering its options.    Approach to MD&A               The purpose of MD&A is to provide our shareholders and other interested parties with information necessary to gain an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. As such, we seek to satisfy three principal objectives:                        to provide a narrative explanation of a companys financial statements in plain English that enables the average investor to see the company through the eyes of management;                           to enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which financial information should be analyzed; and                           to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, a companys earnings and cash flow, so that investors can ascertain the likelihood and relationship of past performance being indicative of future performance.                            We believe the best way to achieve this is to give the reader:                           An understanding of our operating environment and its risks                           An outline of critical accounting policies                           A review of our corporate governance structure                           A review of the key components of the financial statements and our cash position and capital resources                           A review of the important trends in the financial statements and our cash flow                           Disclosure on our internal controls and procedures       Operating Environment               We operate in a very difficult business environment. This environment impacts us in various ways, some of which are discussed below which such items are further discussed in greater detail in Risk Factors elsewhere in this report                        Our Board of Directors has Determined it is in the Companys and its Stockholders Interests to Sell the Companys Assets                           We Are Unable to Achieve or Sustain Profitability in the Future or Obtain Future Financing and Our Business Operations Will Fail                           There is No Guarantee That There Will be Funds Available for Distribution to Stockholders if We Cannot Get Stockholder Approval for the Asset Sale, if the Approval is Untimely or if Claims Arise Post-Sale During the 275-Day Warranty Period                           The Market For Our Stock May Be Not Remain Liquid And The Stock Price May Be Subject To Volatility            In December 2005 our revenues were stagnant, with those from certain of our major customers winding down. Revenues from certain of our other customers appear not to be sustainable in the future. In December 2005, two of our four directors resigned and the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary resigned from all positions held with the Company other than as a director, Chairman and Secretary. For these and other reasons, and after exploring other exit strategies and opportunities, our Board of Directors concluded in December 2005 to attempt to sell the Company either through a sale of assets or a sale of multiple, non-exclusive perpetual licenses with a subsequent sale of the residual assets and engaged Strategic Equity Group to assist us in this endeavor. Following such transaction, it is anticipated that the Company would be wound up and dissolved. The   17        consummation of any such transaction and the determination to wind up and dissolve is subject to stockholder approval. Although the Company has negotiated an agreement for the sale of assets, there is no assurance that such transaction will be approved by stockholders or consummated. Such approval was not received at the February 21, 2007 Special Meeting of Stockholders, requiring us to evaluate the Companys options. Further, even if such transaction is consummated, there is no assurance that there will be any funds available for distribution to stockholders. If such sale and subsequent wind up and dissolution is not approved, the Board of Directors will be required to explore other alternatives for the Company and its business.   We have experienced a loss from operations and a net loss in each of the last four years. While our objective and full effort has been on managing a profitable business, due to the market conditions and factors outlined in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and their impact on fluctuations in operating expenses and revenues, we no longer believe that we will be able to generate a positive profit position in any given future period. We cannot guarantee that we will increase sales of our products and technologies, or that we will successfully develop and market any additional products, or achieve or sustain future profitability. We cannot, because of market and business conditions, rely on the sale of shares or on debt financings in the future. Further, we do not believe that debt or equity financing will be available as required and as such, have decided to try to sell the assets of the Company.   The PC and consumer electronics markets are under intense pressure, primarily from retailers, to reduce selling prices, with resultant pressure to reduce costs. In addition, certain of our competitors appear to be pursuing a business plan that disregards commercially reasonable pricing to achieve a larger market penetration even if the penetration will not provide for viable margins or returns. Cost reductions are driven by lower cost sourcing, often in China, design simplification and reduction in or substitution of features. Therefore, we have been seeking commercial acceptance of our products in highly competitive markets. We responded by offering additional products targeted to each price and quality segment of the market, more aggressively priced and feature enriched our products and entered new segments, such as cell phones, with different competitive pressure. Our value proposition that stressed the cost reducing capabilities of our audio solutions through improved performance from lower cost components as well as product differentiation that Spatializer technology can deliver, failed to resonate with our targeted customers in this highly competitive environment. The result was the elimination of features, including ours, to reduce cost. There is no assurance that our present or contemplated future products or a repositioned value proposition will achieve or maintain sufficient commercial acceptance, or if they do, that functionally equivalent products will not be developed by current or future competitors or customers who had access to significantly greater resources or which are willing to give away their products.   Spatializer does not develop or market semiconductors. That is why we carry no inventory or have no order backlogs that typically are good indicators of near term performance. Rather, we develop audio algorithms that are embedded on third party processors or semiconductors used by our customers. While our algorithms are implemented on a wide array of processors, often times a customer uses a processor where there is no such implementation, or where a competing solution has been implemented. In this case, our customers request that our algorithm be implemented. While these requests are typically honored, processor manufacturers must schedule such implementation as their resources or corporate strategies allow. Therefore, the supply-chain is often quite long and complicated, which potentially can result in delays or deadlines that may not always coincide with our customers requirements and which are beyond the control of our company .  In addition, standards may be adopted by cell phone system operators or manufacturers that may impede or prevent the penetration of non-standard technology onto their platforms. Lastly, customer implementation delays have put off expected cash flow into the future, beyond the time frame of operations based on our available cash resources.   Therefore, when reviewing the operating results or drawing conclusions with regard to future performance, these competitive forces and uncertainties must be taken into consideration. Though there is no absolute long-term visibility, it is likely that our operations would fail if we attempted to continue long-term in this environment. Hence, the Companys Board of Directors has decided to recommend to and seek the approval of stockholders for the sale of the assets of the Company and liquidation of the business.   Critical Accounting Policies               Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In consultation with our Board of Directors and Audit Committee, we have identified three accounting policies that we believe are critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These are important accounting policies that require managements most difficult, subjective judgments.              The first critical accounting policy relates to revenue recognition. Royalty revenues are recognized upon shipment of products    18           incorporating the related technology by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and foundries. These revenues are reported to us by our licensees in formal, written royalty reports, which serve as the basis for our quarterly revenue accruals. Infrequently, certain written reports are received after our required reporting deadlines, sometimes due to contractual requirements. In such cases, management tries to obtain verbal reports or informal reports from the Licensee. In the absence of such information, management may utilize conservative estimates based on information received or historical trends. In such isolated cases, management strives to under-estimate such revenues to err on the side of caution. In the event such estimates are used, the revenue for the following quarter is adjusted based on receipt of the written report. In addition, any error in Licensee reporting, which is very infrequent, is adjusted in the subsequent quarter when agreed by both parties as correct.              The second critical accounting policy relates to research and development expenses. We expense all research and development expenses as incurred. Costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of our algorithms (which is the primary component of our licensing) are expensed as incurred and included in Research and Development expenses. Such algorithms are refined based on customer requirements and licensed for inclusion in the customers specific product. There are no production costs to capitalize as defined in Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 86.              The third critical accounting policy relates to our long-lived assets. The Company continually reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets using the methodology prescribed in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 144, Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company also reviews long-lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows to which the assets relate, to the carrying amount. If the asset is determined to be unable to recover its carrying value, then intangible assets, if any, are written down to fair value first, followed by the other long-lived assets. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows, appraised values or managements estimates, depending on the nature of the assets. Our intangible assets consist primarily of patents. We capitalize all costs directly attributable to patents and trademarks, consisting primarily of legal and filing fees, and amortize such costs over the remaining life of the asset (which range from 3 to 20 years) using the straight-line method. In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, only intangible assets with definite lives are amortized. Non-amortized intangible assets are instead subject to annual impairment testing. Management believes, based on the negotiated purchase price for the sales of its assets, that the fair value of its assets exceeds the recorded net carrying value.              Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Companys significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.    Key Components of the Financial Statements and Important Trends               The Companys financial statements, including the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity, should be read in conjunction with the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. MD&A explains the key components of each of these financial statements, key trends and reasons for reporting period-to-period fluctuations.              The Consolidated Balance Sheet provides a snapshot view of our financial condition at the end of our fiscal year. A balance sheet helps management and our stockholders understand the financial strength and capabilities of our business. Balance sheets can help identify and analyze trends, particularly in the area of receivables and payables. A review of cash balances compared to the prior years and in relation to ongoing profit or loss can show the ability of the Company to withstand business variations. The difference between Current Assets and Current Liabilities is referred to as Working capital and measures how much in liquid assets a company has available to build its business. Receivables that are substantially higher than revenue for the quarter may indicate a slowdown of collections, with an impact on future cash position. This is addressed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.               The Consolidated Statement of Operations tells the reader whether the Company had a profit or loss. It shows key sources of revenue and major expense categories. It is important to note period-to-period comparisons of each line item of this statement, reasons for any fluctuation and how costs are managed in relation to the overall revenue trend of the business. These statements are prepared using accrual accounting under generally accepted accounting standards in the United States. This is addressed further in MD&A under Revenues and Expenses.    19                      The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows explains the actual sources and uses of cash. Some expenses of the Company, such as depreciation and amortization, do not result in a cash outflow in the current period, since the underlying patent expenditure or asset purchase was made years earlier. New capital expenditures, on the other hand, result in a disbursement of cash, but will be expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over their useful lives. Fluctuations in receivables and payables also explain why the net change in cash is not equal to the net loss reported on the Statement of Operations. Therefore, it is possible that the impact of a net loss on cash is less or more than the actual amount of the loss. This is discussed further in MD&A under Liquidity and Capital Resources.               The Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity shows the impact of the operating results on the Companys equity. In addition, this statement shows new equity brought into the Company through stock sales or stock option exercise. This is discussed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.     Results of Operations          The following discussion and analysis relates to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, and the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.   For the Year Ended December 31, 2006, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005                Revenues               Revenues decreased to $333,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1,192,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, an decrease of 72%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer ®  audio signal processing algorithms.              The decrease in revenue resulted partially from the absence of recognition of deferred revenue in the current year, as compared to 2005, in which a royalty advance received during 2004 was recognized. In addition, programs were not renewed or extended due to the termination of operations of the Company in January 2006. Existing revenues are derived from legacy licensing programs and are expected to wind down.               Gross Profit               Gross profit decreased to $332,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1,086,000 in the comparable period last year, an decrease of 69%. Gross margin was 99% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 91% of revenue for the comparable period last year. The decrease in gross profit resulted from lower revenues in fiscal 2006, partially offset by higher margins. We maintain a high margin since revenues are from licensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated direct manufacturing or selling costs other than commissions paid to our independent representatives that solicit and oversee the particular accounts. All development costs are expensed as engineering and development expenses in the period they are incurred. In 2006, all major relationships with distributors were terminated and no commissions were earned or payable.               Operating Expenses               Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased to $686,000 (206% of sales) from $1,177,000 (99% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 42%. The decrease in operating expenses resulted primarily from decreases in general and administrative expense, sales and marketing expense, and research and development expense due to the suspension of operations.               General and Administrative               General and administrative expense decreased to $527,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $670,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 21%. The decrease is primarily due to discontinued CEO travel and general operating costs, partially offset by increased legal and accounting expenses related to public filings, in part in response to the additional requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. General operating costs include rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery, postage, depreciation and similar costs.    20                       Research and Development               Research and development costs decreased to $158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $354,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 55%. The decrease in research and development expense was due to the elimination of an in-house applications engineering position and the resignation of the principal engineer in May 2006.               Sales and Marketing               Sales and marketing costs decreased to $1,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $152,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, an decrease of 99%. The decrease in such expenses resulted from cessation of all licensing and marketing activities in January 2006 due to the suspension of operations.               Net Income (Loss)               The net loss was $353,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to net loss of $82,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increased net loss for the current period is primarily the result of lower revenue, partially offset by lower overhead.    For the Year Ended December 31, 2005, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004                Revenues               Revenues increased to $1,192,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 8%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer ®  audio signal processing algorithms.              The increase in revenue resulted from a greater recognition of deferred revenue in the current year, as compared to the prior year, in which a royalty advance was received. In addition, revenues increased from royalties on a third party semiconductor used in cellular phones, as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by declining revenues from two accounts whose products using our technology reached end of life. Their new models do not utilize our technology.               Gross Profit               Gross profit increased to $1,086,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $995,000 in the comparable period last year, an increase of 9%. Gross margin was 91% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 90% of revenue for the comparable period last year. The increase in gross profit resulted from higher revenues in fiscal 2006. We maintain a high margin since revenues are from licensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated direct manufacturing or selling costs other than commissions paid to our independent representatives that solicit and oversee the particular accounts. All development costs are expensed as engineering and development expenses in the period they are incurred.               Operating Expenses               Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased to $1,177,000 (99% of sales) from $1,146,000 (105% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 3%. The increase in operating expenses resulted primarily from increases in general and administrative expense and sales and marketing expense. General and Administrative expenses increased due to higher legal and audit expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased due to higher travel expenses resulting from more overseas licensing trips.               General and Administrative               General and administrative expense increased to $670,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $615,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 9%. The increase is primarily due to increased legal and accounting expenses related to public filings, in part in response to the additional requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and to increased travel costs by the CEO. General operating costs include rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery, postage, depreciation and similar costs.    21                       Research and Development               Research and Development costs decreased to $354,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $393,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of 10%. The decrease in research and development expense was due to the commencement of the use of lower cost applications engineering consultants in India in the second half of 2004 and the elimination of an in-house applications engineering position in early 2005. The number of projects completed by the Indian engineering firm were higher in 2005 as compared to 2004, partially offsetting the savings from the eliminated in-house engineering staff position.              We continued efforts to identify, validate, and develop new product ideas at DPI. Specific engineering efforts were directed toward the launch of Spatializer ((environ)) 3G and applications engineering to port our technology to leading processor platforms.               Sales and Marketing               Sales and Marketing costs increased to $152,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 10%. The increase in such expenses resulted from higher international travel in search of new licensing arrangements.               Net Income (Loss)               Net loss was $82,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005; ($0.00) basic per share, compared to net loss of $157,000, ($0.00) per share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The reduction in net loss for the current period is primarily the result of higher revenue, partially offset by higher overhead.    Liquidity and Capital Resources               At December 31, 2006, we had $229,000 in cash and cash equivalents as compared to $551,000 at December 31, 2005. The decrease in cash primarily resulted from the net loss. We had working capital of $242,000 at December 31, 2006 as compared with working capital of $560,000 at December 31, 2005.              Net cash used by operating activities was $305,907 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to net cash used by operating activities of $256,568 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by operating activities of $343,939 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in cash flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily a result of the net lossand a decrease in accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable.              We use cash in investing activities primarily to secure patent and trademark protection for our proprietary technology and brand name. Cash used in investing activities totaled $15,013, $8,145 and $20,587, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. All expenditures for on-going research and development are expenses and therefore included in the Net Loss.              Net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $773, $55,809 and $41,994 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.              In December 2005, the Company, as stipulated by the related Subscription Agreement, forced the conversion of all outstanding Series B-1 Preferred Stock, into Restricted Common Stock at the minimum conversion price of $.56 per share. This resulted in the issuance of 1,788,018 Common Stock shares, worth approximately $100,000 at market value at issuance. This issuance diluted existing common stockholders by approximately 4%, but eliminated $1.1 million in liquidation preference shares.              Future payments due under operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2006 are described below:                                                                                                                              Payments due by period                                         Less than                                                      More than           Contractual obligations         Total              1 year              1-3 years              3-5 years              5 years              Long-Term Debt Obligations                                                                                                          Capital Lease Obligations                                                                                                          Operating Lease Obligations         $    1,200              $    1,200                                                                       Purchase Obligations                                                                                                          Total         $    1,200              $    1,200                                                                         22                    In the event the Company is to be would up and dissolved the Company would attempt to settle these amounts, negotiate early termination, or pay the remaining obligation if cash resources permitted.              Our future cash flow must come primarily from the audio signal processing licensing and OEM royalties until or if our efforts to sell the assets of the company, with stockholders approval, is consummated and in that case from any net proceeds from the sale such assets. The Board of Directors will, with the approval of the stockholders, decide on the dispensation of such proceeds.              The fluid, competitive and dynamic nature of the market brought a high degree of uncertainty to our operations. The operations of our business, and those of our competitors, are also impacted by the continued trend in the semiconductor industry to offer free, but minimal audio solutions to certain product classes to maintain and attract market share. In addition, the commoditization of many consumer electronics segments, our lack of resources and the departure of key employee and directors has made it unfeasible to continue to compete.              Based on current and projected operating levels, we no longer believe that we can maintain our liquidity position at a consistent level, on a short-term or long-term basis. As such, we do not believe our current cash reserves and cash generated from our existing operations and customer base are sufficient for us to meet our operating obligations and the anticipated additional research and development for our audio technology business for at least the next 12 months.              On January 10, 2006, the Company announced that it would hold an open auction for the sale of substantially all of its assets. The Board of Directors of the Company decided that it is in the best interests of the stockholders to hold an open auction for the acquisition of the assets of the Company or the granting of an unlimited amount of non-exclusive perpetual licenses for a one-time fee and a subsequent auction of the residual assets. The consummation of any of such transactions will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company. We signed an agreement for the sale of the assets with DTS. At the reconvened stockholder meeting on February 21, 2007, while those shares voted were overwhelmingly in favor of the asset sale and possible dissolution of the Company, a required majority of outstanding shares did not approve the asset sale or possible dissolution of the Company. The Board is considering its options.    Net Operating Loss Carryforwards               At December 31, 2006, we had net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately $26,800,000 which are available to offset future Federal taxable income, if any, through 2015. Approximately $21,700,000 of these net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $1,000,000.    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements               In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements . SFAS 157 replaces the different definitions of fair value in the accounting literature with a single definition. It defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 is effective for fair-value measurements already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of SFAS 157 on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.       Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    We have not been exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on our short-term investments at December 31, 2006. A hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in interest rate (ten percent of our overall earnings rate) would not result in a material fluctuation in future earnings or cash flow. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or for speculative purposes and we are not currently evaluating the future use of such financial instruments.    23               Item 8.
