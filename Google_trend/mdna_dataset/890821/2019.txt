Company History      We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in February 1994 as Spatializer Audio Laboratories, Inc., which          had been a shell company until May of 2015. On May 26, 2015, we completed a “reverse merger” transaction, in which we caused Ameri100 Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation as our newly created, wholly owned subsidiary, to be merged with and          into Ameri and Partners (doing business as Ameri100), a Delaware corporation. As a result of the Merger, Ameri and Partners became our wholly owned subsidiary with Ameri and Partners’ former stockholders acquiring a majority of the outstanding          shares of our common stock.  The Merger was consummated under Delaware law, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in connection with            the Merger we changed our name to AMERI Holdings, Inc.  Since the Merger, we have been an active holding company headquartered in Suwanee, Georgia, with offices across the United States that are supported by offices in India.    Overview    We specialize in delivering SAP cloud, digital and enterprise services to clients worldwide. Our SAP focus allows us to provide          technological solutions to a broad and growing base of clients. Our model inverts the conventional global delivery model wherein offshore IT service providers are based abroad and maintain a minimal presence in the United States. With a strong          SAP focus, our client partnerships anchor around SAP cloud and digital services.      We partnered with NEC Corporation of America (NEC), in February 2017, to offer SAP HANA Migration services. Through this partnership,          the Company will offer solutions to its clients aspiring to make the transition from SAP ECC (on-premise) applications to SAP HANA applications. NEC is a leading technology integrator providing integrated communications, analytics, security,          biometrics and technology solutions.     26     We generate revenue by providing consulting services under written service contracts with our customers. The service contracts we          enter into generally fall into two categories: (1) time-and-materials contracts and (2) fixed-price contracts.      When a customer enters into a time-and-materials or fixed-price (or a periodic retainer-based) contract, the revenue is recognized in          accordance with the deliverables of each contract. If the deliverables involve separate units of accounting, the consideration from the arrangement is measured and allocated to the separate units, based on vendor specific objective evidence of          the value for each deliverable.      The revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon          rates. Revenue pursuant to fixed-price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting. We routinely evaluate whether revenue and profitability should be recognized in the current period. We estimate the          proportional performance on fixed-price contracts on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project.      For the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, sales to five major customers accounted for approximately 39% and 43% of          our total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, two of our customers contributed 14% and 10% of our revenues, and for year ended December 31, 2017, one of our customer contributed 11% of our revenue.    We have obtained financing and additional capital from the sale of equity and incurrence of indebtedness in the past, and we continue          to consider capital raising and financing from the sale of various types of equity and incurrence of indebtedness to provide capital for our business plans and operations in the future.      Matters that May or Are Currently Affecting Our Business      The main challenges and trends that could affect or are affecting our financial results include:            ·   Our ability to enter into additional technology-management and consulting agreements, to diversify our client base and to expand the geographic areas we serve;                 ·   Our ability to attract competent, skilled professionals and on-demand technology partners for our operations at acceptable prices to manage our overhead;                 ·   Our ability to acquire other technology services companies and integrate them with our existing business;                 ·   Our ability to raise additional equity capital, if and when we needed;                 ·   We may incur an impairment of the goodwill acquired from our prior business acquisitions if our acquired entities do not experience growth; and                 ·   Our ability to control our costs of operation as we expand our organization and capabilities.         We have incurred significant and recurring operational losses as a result of our ongoing acquisition strategy. We have outstanding          cash payment obligations related to our past acquisitions of approximately $2.7 million. Notwithstanding our working capital constraints, we are current in all payments to all our unsecured noteholders. We are working with certain of our          unsecured noteholders to negotiate payment terms until we are able to raise more capital.    There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional sources of capital or that cost savings will provide sufficient          working capital.  If we continue to be unable to pay all outstanding payments under our unsecured notes, the unpaid noteholders may take legal action against us, they may accelerate the payment of the principal under the applicable notes, and our          senior secured lender may call a cross-default under our existing credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of the obligations thereunder and have a negative impact on our revenue and financial results.  Should we be unable to raise          sufficient debt or equity capital, we could be forced to cease operations. Our plan regarding these matters is to work to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to allow us the ability to cover our current cash flow requirements and meet          our obligations as they become due. There can be no assurances that financing will be available or if available, that such financing will be available under favorable terms.     27     Result of Operations    Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017             Twelve Months  Ended December 31,                2018           2017                                Net revenue       $    42,998,280          $    48,593,712         Cost of revenue          34,014,776             38,355,967         Gross profit          8,983,504             10,237,745                                      Operating expenses:                              Selling, general and administration          10,794,822             18,510,120         Depreciation and amortization          2,903,662             3,217,191         Acquisition related expenses          333,237             481,123         Changes in estimate for consideration payable          (6,940,310    )          (1,074,158    )      Impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets          9,038,553             -         Operating expenses          16,129,964             21,134,276         Operating Income (loss):          (7,146,460    )          (10,896,531    )                                   Interest expense          (729,896    )          (575,039    )      Other income          88,161             4,995         Change in fair value of warrant liability          (2,760,819    )          -         Total other income /(expenses)          (3,402,554    )          (570,044    )      Income (loss) before income taxes          (10,549,014    )          (11,466,575    )      Income tax benefit          (6,348,502    )          2,391,762         Net Income (loss)          (16,897,516    )          (9,074,813    )      Dividend on preferred stock          (2,583,185    )          (2,089,151    )      Net (loss) attributable to common stock holders          (19,480,701    )          (11,163,964    )      Other comprehensive income/ (loss), net of tax:                              Foreign exchange translation adjustment          50,122             44,301         Total comprehensive income (loss)       $    (19,430,579    )          (11,119,663    )      Comprehensive (loss) attributable to the Company          (19,430,579    )          (11,119,663    )      Comprehensive (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest          -             -                  (19,430,579    )          (11,119,663    )      Basic income (loss) per share       $    (0.82    )       $    (0.75    )      Diluted income (loss) per share       $    (0.82    )       $    (0.75    )                                   Basic weighted average number of shares          23,790,030             14,982,791         Diluted weighted average number of shares          23,790,030             14,982,791           28     Revenues      Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $5.6 million, or 12%, as compared to the year ended December 31,          2017, mainly because we did not pursue certain low margin professional services business during the year ended December 31, 2018.    For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, sales to five major customers accounted for approximately 39%          and 43% of our total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, two of our customers contributed 14% and 10% of our revenue, and for the year ended December 31, 2017, one of our customers contributed 11% of our revenue.    We derived most of our revenues from our customers located in North America for the years ended December 31, 2018 and          December 31, 2017.    Gross Margin    Our gross margin was 21% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31 2017.      Our target gross margins in future periods are anticipated to be in the range of 20% to 25% based on a mix of project          revenues and professional service revenues. However, there is no assurance that we will achieve such anticipated gross margins.    Selling, General and Administration Expenses    Selling, general and administration (“SG&A”) expenses include all costs, including rent costs, which are not directly          associated with revenue-generating activities, as well as the non-cash expense for stock based compensation. These include employee costs, corporate costs and facilities costs. Employee costs include administrative salaries and related employee          benefits, travel, recruiting and training costs. Corporate costs include reorganization costs, legal, accounting and outside consulting fees. Facilities costs primarily include rent and communications costs.    SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $10.8 million, as compared to $18.5 million for the year ended          December 31, 2017.  SG&A expenses decreased by $7.7 million, of which $5.8 million was attributable to stock based compensation expense in 2017 and balance of $1.8 million is relating to the cost benefits we achieved through our restructuring          done in 2017 and 2018.      Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $3.2          million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We capitalized the customer lists acquired during various acquisitions, resulting in increased amortization costs. The customer lists from each acquisition are amortized over a period of 60 months.           Our amortization schedule is as follows:       Year                      ending December 31,      $  Amount        2019          2,197,018         2020          2,076,018         2021          1,380,000         2022          125,000         Total       $    5,778,036            Changes in Estimates    During the year ended December 30, 2018, the Company recognized a one-time non-cash gain of $6.9 million as a result of the Company’s          change in estimate of its consideration payable related to its acquisition of Ameri Arizona. The Company had previously accounted for total equity consideration payable of $10.4 million, which was reduced to $3.3 million as a result of two former          members of Ameri Arizona electing to receive approximately $2.5 million in cash and the issuance of equity valued at $0.8 million to the third former member Ameri Arizona who had not elected to receive cash.    Impairment on goodwill and intangibles    As a result of our annual impairment testing on goodwill and of triggering events identified with respect to certain intangible          assets, we recorded impairment charges of $9.0 million with respect to the goodwill of certain of our reporting units and certain customer lists.     29     Operating Income (loss)      Our operating loss was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $10.9 million for the year ended December 31,          2017. This decrease was mainly due to the significant decrease in stock based compensation expenses and restructuring benefits.    Interest Expense    Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.7 million as compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31,          2017.    Changes in fair value of warrant liability    In connection with a private placement transaction during 2018 as described further below, we issued warrants that were determined to          be derivative financial instruments, and accordingly require adjustments to remeasure them to fair value upon certain events as described below. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $2.8 million in changes in fair value from the          initial issuance date through the end of the year.    Income Taxes    current income tax expenses for the year ended was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. During the          year ended December 31, 2018 the company has provided a valuation allowance of $6.1 million and for the year ended December 31, 2017 the company recorded deferred tax benefit of $2.4 million.    The total tax expenses was $6.3 million and $(2.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 respectively.      Acquisition Related Expenses    We had acquisition related expenditures of $0.3 million and $0.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31,          2017, respectively. These expenses included legal, professional services, valuation and due diligence services and other acquisition related fees incurred in connection with our acquisitions. The decrease was due to the decline in acquisition          related activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.    Liquidity and Capital Resources      Our cash position was $1.4 million as of December 31, 2018, as compared to $4.9 million as of December 31, 2017.    Cash used for operating activities was $2.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and $2.7 million during the year ended          December 31, 2017.  We were able to control the level of cash used for operating activities from year to year through cost-cutting measures that reduced working capital requirements. Cash used in investing activities was $3.6 million during the          year ended December 31, 2018. Cash provided by financing activities was $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and was attributable to the sale of common stock through private placement and net bank borrowings.    Public offering and Private Placement    On November 21, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of          $4.115 per share, and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of $0.01 per warrant. The warrants have a per share exercise price of $4.115, were exercisable as of November 21, 2017 and expire          five years from that date. The gross proceeds to us from this offering were approximately $6,084,375, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses.  In connection with the offering, we uplisted our          common stock from the OTCQB Marketplace to trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “AMRH”, and we listed the publicly offered warrants for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “AMRHW”.    On January 24, 2018, we received confirmation from our transfer agent, Corporate Stock Transfer, Inc., which also serves as the warrant          agent for the public warrant, that through such date certain holders of warrants had cumulatively exercised warrants for the purchase of a total of 153,060 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $4.115 per share, for gross proceeds          to us of $629,841.90     30     On July 25, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Initial Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain          institutional and accredited investors (“Initial Purchasers”) for the sale of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock (“Initial Shares”) and warrants to purchase a total of 4,000,001 shares (“Initial Warrant Shares”) of our common stock (“Initial          Purchaser Warrants”) for total consideration of approximately $6,000,000 (“Initial Investment”). On July 30, 2018, we issued an aggregate of 3,250,000 of the Initial Shares to the Initial Purchasers, with the remaining Initial Shares to be issued          pursuant to pre-funded Warrants, subject to adjustment.  The $6,000,000 purchase price paid by the Initial Purchasers on July 30, 2018 represents the entire purchase price for the Initial Shares and the Initial Purchaser Warrants (excluding the          exercise price to be paid upon the exercise of Initial Purchaser Warrants), including upon the issuance of additional Shares (through the adjustment of a pre-funded warrant) and for additional Warrant Shares issuable upon the occurrence of          certain events described below.      On August 21, 2018, we entered into a second securities purchase agreement (the “Second Securities Purchase Agreement”, and together          with the Initial Securities Purchase Agreement, the “Purchase Agreements”) with an accredited investor (the “Additional Purchaser”, and with the Initial Purchaser, the “Purchasers”) for the sale of 500,417 shares of our common stock, via a          pre-funded warrant due to share issuance limitations (the “Additional Shares”, and with the Initial Shares, the “Common Stock”), and warrants to purchase 400,333 shares (the “Additional Warrant Shares”, and with the Initial Warrant Shares, the          “Warrant Shares”) of our common stock (the “Additional Purchaser Warrants”, and with the Initial Purchaser Warrants, the “Purchaser Warrants”) for gross proceeds of approximately $600,000 (the “Additional Investment”). The Additional Investment          was made in connection with, and substantially on the same terms and using the same forms as, the private placement of the Initial Shares and Initial Purchaser Warrants (such private placement and the Additional Investment, the “Private          Placement”).  The $600,000 purchase price paid by the Additional Purchaser on August 21, 2018 represents the entire purchase price for the Additional Shares and the Additional Purchaser Warrants (excluding the exercise price to be paid upon the          exercise of Additional Purchaser Warrants), including upon the issuance of additional Shares (through the adjustment of a pre-funded warrant, all pre-funded warrants with the Purchaser Warrants, the “Warrants”) and for additional Warrant Shares          issuable upon the occurrence of certain events described below.    The initial price per share of Common Stock equaled $1.20 and the initial per share exercise price of the Purchaser Warrants equaled          $1.60.  The per share purchase price and the exercise price were subject to adjustment as described below.  The Initial Purchaser Warrants are immediately exercisable, subject to ownership limitations described below, and expire five years after          the date of issuance.  The Initial Purchaser Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis six months after the issuance date if there is no effective registration statement registering the resale of the shares underlying the Initial Purchaser          Warrants. The Additional Purchaser was not issued any shares at the closing of the Additional Investment, due to Nasdaq stock issuance limitations at the time of closing, but the Additional Shares will be issued upon the exercise of a pre-funded          warrant for no additional consideration to the Company. The Additional Purchaser Warrants and the Additional Purchaser’s pre-funded warrant are currently exercisable, subject to ownership limitations described below, and expire five years after          the date of issuance. The Warrants contain provisions for the adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrant and of the exercise price in the event of stock dividends, splits, mergers, asset sales, tender or exchange          offers, reclassifications, reorganizations or recapitalizations, combinations, or the like.    The per share purchase price (through the pre-funded Warrants) and Warrant exercise price was automatically adjusted lower (the “Price          Adjustment”) to 80% (with respect to the purchase price of the Common Stock) and 110% (with respect to the exercise price of the Warrants) of the lowest of the average daily prices on the 6 trading days following each of: (i) the date our          stockholders approved the Private Placement transaction (such approval was obtained on September 27, 2018) and (ii) the date a registration statement covering the resale of securities being issued in the Private Placement was declared effective          by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (such registration statement on Form S-1, file no. 333-227011, was declared effective on October 23, 2018 (the “Effective Registration”)). Due to the Price Adjustment, the lowest purchase          price of $0.29 for the Common Stock issued at closing under the Purchase Agreements and pursuant to the pre-funded Warrants was achieved, and all 22,758,621 shares registered under the Effective Registration as issued or issuable under the          Purchase Agreements and pursuant to the pre-funded Warrants were issued to the selling stockholders.  In addition, the exercise price of the Purchaser Warrants was subject to the Price Adjustment, which has resulted in 22,544,139 shares of common          stock being issuable under the Purchaser Warrants when exercised. The Purchaser Warrants have been fully adjusted and neither the exercise price or the number of shares issuable under such warrants are subject to further adjustment, except          pursuant to typical anti-dilution provisions.      In accordance with the exercise provisions of the Purchaser Warrants, the 22,544,139 shares issuable under the Purchaser Warrants          following the full Price Adjustment was determined by holding constant the aggregate exercise price of $7,040,534.40 for the Purchaser Warrants at the time of closing of the Private Placement (which was calculated based on 4,400,334 total          Purchaser Warrants at the closing date multiplied by the exercise price of $1.60, which equals $7,040,534.40), and then dividing the $7,040,534.40 aggregate exercise price by the post-Price Adjustment exercise price of $0.3123 to get 22,544,139          shares.  As 18,206,897 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Purchaser Warrants were previously registered under the Effective Registration, 4,337,242 additional shares of common stock are to be registered pursuant to a new registration          statement to cover all of the shares issuable under the Purchaser Warrants following the final Price Adjustment.      The Company has allocated the aggregate gross proceeds received to the Purchaser Warrants, the Initial Shares issued and the          pre-funded warrants. Due to the reset features present in the Purchaser Warrants along with the existence of down-round protection in the event of future financing transactions at lower prices, the Purchaser Warrants were determined to be          derivative financial instruments and therefore, have been recorded as a liability (“Warrant Liability”) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Purchaser Warrants were initially recorded at fair value with fair value determined          utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected term of 5 years; expected volatility of 111.8%; risk free interest rate of 2.37% and an expected dividend yield of zero. The calculated aggregate fair value          of $1,429,000 was reflected as Warrant Liability. The remaining proceeds received under the Purchase Agreements were allocated to the Initial Shares and pre-funded warrants and recorded within stockholder’s equity. The fair value of the Purchaser          Warrants was reassessed to reflect the Price Adjustment and number of shares issuable upon exercise. The resulting increase in the fair value of the Purchaser Warrants of $2,760,819 was reflected as “Changes in Fair Value of Warrant Liability”          within the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).     31     Under the terms of all of the Warrants, a selling stockholder may not exercise Warrants to the extent such exercise would cause such          selling stockholder, together with its affiliates and attribution parties, to beneficially own a number of shares of common stock which would exceed 4.99% or 9.99%, as applicable, of our then outstanding common stock following such exercise,          excluding for purposes of such determination shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants which have not been exercised. In addition, the Warrants have transaction-specific anti-dilution provisions.      A.G.P. / Alliance Global Partners (“AGP”) acted as exclusive placement agent for the issuance and sale of the securities in the Private          Placement. We agreed to pay AGP an aggregate fee equal to 7% of the gross proceeds received by us from the sale of the securities in the transaction, plus expenses. We also agreed to grant to AGP or its designees warrants to purchase up to          150,000 shares of our common stock (the “Placement Agent Warrants”). The Placement Agent Warrants are currently exercisable and terminate on July 27, 2022. The Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price of $1.32 per share. The terms of the          Placement Agent Warrants are otherwise substantially similar to the terms of the Private Placement Warrants, except the Placement Agent Warrants have customary anti-dilution provisions and do not have the Price Adjustment mechanism. The Placement          Agent Warrants were valued at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model with substantially similar assumptions to those used for the Purchaser Warrants. The resulting fair value of $49,000 was recorded within stockholder’s          equity as a cost of the Private Placement transaction.     Liquidity Concerns      As of December 31, 2018, we had negative working capital of              $4.7 million and cash of $1.4 million.  Our principal sources of cash have included bank borrowings, the private placement of shares and net bank borrowings. To increase revenues,              our operating expenses are likely to continue to grow and, as a result, we will need to generate significant additional revenues to cover such expenses.      Our financial statements as of December 31, 2018 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going            concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional funding through the issuance of equity or debt securities, as well as to attain further operating efficiencies and, ultimately, to generate            additional revenues. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We can give no assurances that additional capital that we are able to obtain, if any, will be sufficient to            meet our needs. The foregoing conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.     Available Credit Facility, Borrowings and Repayment of Debt    On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), with its wholly-owned subsidiaries          Ameri and Partners and Ameri Georgia, as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Linear Logics, Corp. and WinHire Inc. (dissolved in March 2017) serving as guarantors, the Company’s former Chief Executive          Officer, serving as a validity guarantor, and Sterling National Bank, N.A. (as lender and as agent, “Sterling”). The Company joined Ameri California, Virtuoso and Ameri Arizona as borrowers under the Loan Agreement following their respective          acquisition.      Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers could borrow up to an aggregate of $10 million The outstanding balance under the          Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2018 was $4 million.    On January 23, 2019, certain subsidiaries of the Company, including Ameri100 Arizona LLC, Ameri100 Georgia, Inc., Ameri100          California, Inc. and Ameri and Partners, Inc., as borrowers (individually and collectively, “Borrower”) entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), with North Mill Capital LLC, as lender (the “Lender”). The Loan Agreement          has an initial term of two years from the closing date, with renewal thereafter if Lender, at its option, agrees in writing to extend the term for additional one year periods (the “Term”). The Loan Agreement is collateralized by a first-priority          security interest in all of the assets of Borrower. In addition, (i) pursuant to a Corporate Guaranty entered into by the Company in favor of the Lender (the “Corporate Guaranty”), the Company has guaranteed the Borrower’s obligations under the          Credit Facility and (ii) pursuant to a Security Agreement entered into between the Company and Lender (the “Security Agreement”), the Company granted a first-priority security interest in all of its assets to Lender.    The Borrowers received an initial advance on January 23, 2019 in an amount of approximately $2.85 million (the “Initial          Advance”). Borrowings under the Credit Facility accrue interest at the prime rate (as designated by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association) plus one and three quarters percentage points (1.75%), but in no event shall the interest rate be less          than seven and one-quarter percent (7.25%). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Loan Documents, the minimum monthly interest payable by Borrower on the Advances (as defined in the Loan Agreement) in any month shall be          calculated based on an average Daily Balance (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for such month.  For the first year of the Term, Borrower shall pay to Lender a facility fee equal to $50,000, due in equal          monthly installments, with additional facility fees due to Lender in the event borrowings exceed certain thresholds and with additional facility fees due and payable in later years or upon later milestones. In addition, Borrower shall pay to          Lender a monthly fee (the “Servicing Fee”) in an amount equal to one-eighth percent (.125%) of the average Daily Balance (as defined in the Loan Agreement) during each month on or before the first day of each calendar month during the Term.     32     The Company            used approximately $2.75 million of the Initial Advance to repay all of its outstanding obligations under the Sterling National bank Credit Facility. Upon payment, the Company’s obligations under the Sterling National Bank Credit Facility were            terminated.    Borrower also agreed to certain negative covenants in the Loan Agreement, including that they will not, without the prior          written consent of Lender, enter into any extraordinary transactions, dispose of assets, merge, acquire, or consolidate with or into any other business organization or restructure.    If an Event of Default (as defined in the Loan Agreement) occurs, Lender may, among other things, (i) declare all          obligations immediately due and payable in full; (ii) cease advancing money or extending credit to or for the benefit of Borrower; and/or (iii) terminate the Loan Agreement as to any future liability or obligation of Lender, without affecting          Lender’s right to repayment of all obligations and Lender’s security interests.    On March 7, 2017, we completed the sale and issuance of the 2017 Notes for aggregate proceeds to us of $1.25 million from          four accredited investors, including one of the Company’s then-directors, Dhruwa N. Rai, and David Luci, who became a director of the Company in February 2018. The 2017 Notes were issued pursuant to Securities Purchase Agreements between the          Company and each investor. The 2017 Notes bear interest at 8% per annum until maturity in March 2020, with interest being paid annually on the first, second and third anniversaries of the issuance of the 2017 Notes beginning in March 2018. From          and after an event of default and for so long as the event of default is continuing, the 2017 Notes will bear default interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The 2017 Notes can be prepaid by us at any time without penalty.    The 2017 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $2.80. The holders of the 2017          Notes have the right, at their option, at any time and from time to time to convert, in part or in whole, the outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest under the 2017 Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock at the          conversion price.      The 2017 Notes rank junior to our secured credit facility with Sterling National Bank. The 2017 Notes also include certain          negative covenants including, without the investors’ approval, restrictions on dividends and other restricted payments and reclassification of its stock.    Future Sources of Liquidity    We expect our primary sources of cash to be customer collections and external financing. We also continue to work on cost          reductions, and we have initiated steps to reduce our overhead to improve cash savings.  We may raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities or borrowings from financial institutions or third parties or a combination of          the foregoing. Capital raised will be used to implement our business plan, grow current operations, make acquisitions or start new vertical businesses among some of the possible uses.       Accounts Receivable        Accounts receivable for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $7.9 million as compared to $8.9 million as on December 31, 2017.        Accounts Payable        Accounts payable for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $4.4 million as compared to $5.3 million as on December 31, 2017.        Other Accrued Expenses        Accrued expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.7 million as compared to $2.6 as on December 31, 2017.      33     Foreign Currency Risk      Overall, we believe that we have limited currency risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as most of our          revenues are derived from customers located in North America.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.      Impact of Inflation      We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. On an          ongoing basis, we attempt to minimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and, whenever possible, seeking to ensure that billing rates reflect increases in costs due to inflation.    Critical Accounting Policies      Revenue            Recognition.  We recognize revenue in accordance with the Accounting Standard Codification 606 “Revenue Recognition.” Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2)          delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the seller’s price to buyer is fixed and determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from information technology services as the services are provided.          Service revenues are recognized based on contracted hourly rates, as services are rendered or upon completion of specified contracted services and acceptance by the customer.      Stock-Based Compensation.  Stock-based          compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and non-employee directors is determined based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. We recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the          requisite service period of the award. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.    Warrant Liability .  The Company accounts for the warrants issued in connection with the July 25, 2018 Initial Securities Purchase Agreement in accordance with the guidance on Accounting for Certain Financial                Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which provides that the Company classifies the warrant instrument as a liability at its fair value and adjusts the instrument to fair value at each reporting period. This                liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. The fair value of warrants issued by the Company in connection with                private placements of securities has been estimated using the warrants quoted market price.        Impairment.  Long-lived          assets, which include property, plant and equipment, and certain other assets to be held and used by us, are reviewed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable based on          estimated future cash flows. If this assessment indicates that the carrying values will not be recoverable, as determined based on undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful lives, an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value          of the asset.    Income Taxes.  We provide          for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and          their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely          than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income          in the period that includes the enactment date. Tax benefits earned on employee stock awards in excess of recorded stock-based compensation expense are credited to additional paid-in capital. Our provision for income taxes also includes the          impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related interest.    Accounts Receivable.  We          extend credit to clients based upon management’s assessment of their credit-worthiness on an unsecured basis. We provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience and management evaluation of trend analysis. We          include any balances that are determined to be uncollectible in allowance for doubtful accounts.    Business Combination.  We          account for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires the identification of the acquirer, the determination of the acquisition date and the allocation of the purchase price paid by the acquirer to the identifiable          tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price          over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the          periods in which the costs are incurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.     34     Goodwill and Purchased            Intangibles.  We evaluate goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its          carrying amount. For purchased intangible assets, if our annual qualitative assessment indicates possible impairment, we test the assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of such assets to their carrying value. In determining the fair          value, we utilize various estimates and assumptions, including discount rates and projections of future cash flows. If an impairment is indicated, a write down to the implied fair value of goodwill or fair value of intangible asset is recorded.    Valuation of            Contingent Earn-out Consideration.  Acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on the achievement of certain future financial performance measures of the acquired company. Contingent consideration is required to be          recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement. We believe our estimates and assumptions are          reasonable, however, there is significant judgment involved. We evaluate, on a routine, periodic basis, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration and changes in estimated fair value, subsequent to the initial fair value estimate at          the time of the acquisition, will be reflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in          the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria. Any changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration may          have a material impact on our operating results.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements       New Standards to Be Implemented    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic              842)”. This new standard replaces the existing guidance on leases and requires the lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with lease terms equal to or greater than twelve months. For finance leases, the              lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize total lease expense on a straight-line basis. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim              periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2018. Upon adoption, entities will be required to use a modified retrospective transition which provides for certain practical expedients. Entities are required to apply              the new standard at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Early adoption of this new standard is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this new standard will have on its consolidated financial              statements and related disclosures. The Company does not expect the requirement to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for operating leases to have a material impact on the presentation of its consolidated statements of              financial position.    On November 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash              Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which is intended to reduce diversity in the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. This new standard requires that restricted cash and restricted              cash equivalents be included as components of total cash and cash equivalents as presented on the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and              restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years, but earlier adoption is permitted.  The Company              does not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.    In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, simplifying the              Test for Goodwill Impairment. Under this new standard, goodwill impairment would be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. This ASU eliminates              existing guidance that requires an entity to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that              reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill              impairment test performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Based on the Company’s preliminary assessment of the foregoing update, it does not anticipate such update will have a material impact its financial statements.        35        Standards Implemented    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash                  Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is                  effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The company has implemented the above standard effective this quarter and has made the respective disclosures in Statement of                  Cash Flow.    In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the                  “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605).” This ASU requires an entity to                  recognize revenue when goods are transferred or services are provided to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires                  disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from                  Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), deferral of the Effective Date.” With the issuance of ASU 2015-14, the new revenue guidance ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning                  after December 15, 2018, using one of two prescribed retrospective methods. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customer (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.” The guidance is                  applicable from the date of applicability of ASU 2014-09. This ASU finalizes the amendments to the guidance on the new revenue standard on the identification of performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.                  In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements (Topic 606)” which is applicable from the date of applicability of ASU 2014-09. This guidance provides optional exemptions from the disclosure                  requirement for remaining performance obligations for specific situations in which an entity need not estimate variable consideration to recognize revenue. In May 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical                  Expedients”. This amendment clarified certain aspects of Topic 606 and will be applicable from the date of applicability of ASU 2014-09. The company has implemented the above standard.                ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND                          QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK             As a “smaller reporting company,” we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
