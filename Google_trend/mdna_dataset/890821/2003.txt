Item 7.   Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies        Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. In consultation with our Board of Directors and Audit Committee, we have identified three accounting policies that we believe are key to an understanding of our financial statements. These are important accounting policies that require managements most difficult, subjective judgments.        The first critical accounting policy relates to revenue recognition. We recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to the customer. License revenues are recognized when earned, in accordance with the contractual provisions. Royalty revenues are recognized upon shipment of products incorporating the related technology by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and foundries.   11           The second critical accounting policy relates to research and development expenses. We expense all research and development expenses as incurred. Costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of our algorithms (which is the primary component of our licensing) is expensed as incurred and included in Research and Development expenses. Such algorithms are refined based on customer requirements and licensed for inclusion in the customers specific product. There are no production costs to capitalize as defined in Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 86.        The third critical accounting policy relates to intangible assets. Our intangible assets consist primarily of patents. We capitalize all costs directly attributable to patents, consisting primarily of legal and filing fees, and amortize such costs over the remaining life of the patent (which range from 3 to 20 years) using the straight-line method. In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, only intangible assets with definite lives are amortized. Non-amortized intangible assets are instead subject to annual impairment testing.        The fourth critical accounting policy relates to the existence of an Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  Audit Committee        This committee is directed to review the scope, cost and results of the independent audit of the Companys books and records, the results of the annual audit with Management and the internal auditors and the adequacy of the Companys accounting, financial, and operating controls; to recommend annually to the Board of Directors the selection of the independent auditors; to consider proposals made by the Companys independent auditors for consulting work; and to report to the Board of Directors, when so requested, on any accounting of financial matters.  Compensation and Stock Committee        The Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Company (the Compensation Committee) currently consists of Messrs. Pace and Segel, each of whom is a non-employee director of the Company and a disinterested person with respect to the plans administered by such committee, as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, the Exchange Act). The Compensation Committee reviews and approves annual salaries, bonuses and other forms and items of compensation for senior officers and employees of the Company. Except for plans that are, in accordance with their terms or as required by law, administered by the Board of Directors or another particularly designated group, the Compensation Committee also administers and implements all of the Companys stock option and other stock-based and equity-based benefit plans (including performance-based plans), recommends changes or additions to those plans or awards under the plans.       The following discussion and analysis relates to the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and our subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, and the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the year ended December 31, 2000.         Results of Operations    For the Year Ended December 31, 2002, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001    Revenues        Revenues increased to $1,856,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1,604,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of 16%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer® audio signal processing algorithms.        The increase in revenues is attributed primarily to the addition of two new accounts which generated in excess of 10% of total revenue each, partially offset by declining royalties on declining analog chip sales from another account.         Gross Profit         Gross profit increased to $1,725,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1,507,000 in the comparable period last year, an increase of 14%. Gross margin decreased to 93% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with 94% of revenue for the comparable period last year. The increase in gross profit results from higher revenues in the current year, partially offset by slightly lower gross margin. This decrease in the gross margin percentage reflects a slight change in mix to commissionable foreign royalty revenue compared to non-commissionable U.S. sourced revenue. The Company maintains a high margin since revenues are from licensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated direct manufacturing or selling costs other than commissions paid to the Companys independent representatives that solicit and oversee the particular accounts.         Operating Expenses         Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased to $1,711,000 (92% of sales) from $1,823,000 (114% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of 6%. The decrease in operating expenses results primarily from completion of various outside engineering consulting projects in 2001 for which we paid outside engineering fees. In 2002, a much greater level of applications engineering projects were either done in house or by our licensed distributors and the fees incurred for such work was significantly reduced over the prior year. However, levels of pure R&D were unchanged between the two years, as reflected by the level of new product introductions.         General and Administrative         General and administrative costs increased to $766,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $707,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of 9%. The increase is primarily due to increased legal expenses related to public filings and increased travel by the CEO. General operating costs include rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery, postage, depreciation and similar costs.   12            Research and Development         Research and Development costs decreased to $433,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $639,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of 32%. The decrease in research and development expense was due completion of various outside engineering consulting projects in 2001 for which we paid outside engineering fees. In 2002, a much greater level of applications engineering projects were either done in house or by our licensed distributors and as such, the fees incurred for such work were significantly reduced over the prior year. However, levels of pure R&D were unchanged between the two years, as reflected by the level of new product introductions.        The Company continued efforts to identify, validate, and develop new product ideas at DPI. Specific engineering efforts were directed toward the launch of encompass AV , development of Spatializer Audio Alchemy, refinement of Spatializer Natural Headphone and applications engineering to port the Companys technology to leading processor platforms.         Sales and Marketing         Sales and Marketing costs increased to $513,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $476,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of 8%. Spending was increase in the area of foreign travel, where the Asian customer visitation frequency was doubled in the second half of 2002.         Net Income (Loss)         Net Income was $18,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to net loss of $240,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net Income for the current period is primarily the result of higher revenues and improved overhead management.   For the Year Ended December 31, 2001, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2000    Revenues        Revenues decreased to $1,604,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $2,202,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of 27%. Revenues include license issuance fees and royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer® audio signal processing designs and non-recurring engineering fees.        The decrease in revenues is attributed primarily to (i) decreased royalties from one account resulting from lower unit sales compared to the prior year, (ii) lower royalties from another account due to a timing difference between 2000 and 2001 created when royalty reporting shifted from the DSP foundry (on shipment of DSP) to OEM customer (shipment of DVD player), (iii) loss of an account in mid 2001 which had comprised less than 10% of sales in the prior year and (iv) decreases in per unit Spatializer N-2-2 royalties due to a volume-based sliding scale pricing structure with DSP foundries which did not stabilize until the beginning of the third quarter of 2000.        Gross profit decreased to $1,507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $1,954,000 in the comparable period last year. Gross margin increased to 95% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 89% of revenue for the comparable period last year. The decrease in gross profit results from lower revenues in the current year, partially offset by higher gross margin. This increase in the gross margin percentage reflects the realignment of our Asian sales rep network which included the implementation of lower commission rates. The Company maintains a high margin since revenues are from licensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated direct manufacturing or selling costs.         Operating Expenses         Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased to $1,823,000 (114% of sales) from $1,595,000 (72% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2000, a increase of 11%. The increase in operating expenses results from expansion of the Companys research and development efforts and higher general and administrative expenses relating to legal and public company expenses. The Company undertook an expansion of headcount in early 2001. When it became clear in mid 2001 that anticipated revenue growth was not occurring, the Company began to curtail the scope of its initiatives in order to bring spending levels back in line with reported revenue streams.   13            General and Administrative         General and administrative costs increased to $707,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $599,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of 18%. The increase is primarily due to increased legal expenses related to public filings and increased travel by the CEO. General operating costs include rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery, postage, depreciation and similar costs.         Research and Development         Research and Development costs increased to $640,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $540,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of 19%. The increase in research and development expense was due to the additions to headcount early in the year, search fees paid for certain engineers hired by the Company and expanded use of engineering consultants for specialized projects.        In addition, the Company continued efforts to identify, validate, and develop new product ideas at DPI. Specific engineering efforts were directed toward the launch of Spatializer N-2-2 Ultra , development of Spatializer PCE, refinement of Spatializer Natural Headphone and applications engineering to port the Companys technology to leading processor platforms.         Sales and Marketing         Sales and Marketing costs increased to $476,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $456,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of less than one percent. Spending was maintained at the prior years level in order to continue the development of markets for existing products.         Interest Income         Interest income on short-term investments decreased $23,499 from 2000 to 2001 due to lower cash investments combined with lower interest rates.         Interest Expense         Interest expense decreased $22,862 due to repayment of $225,242 of Notes Payable to Related Parties in 2001.         Other Income (Expense), Net         Other income (expense) includes approximately $35,000 in gains on settlements of claims relating to its discontinued operation, MDT.         Net Income (Loss)         Net loss was $240,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to net income of $382,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The net loss for the current period is primarily the result of lower revenues and higher overhead, partially offset by improved gross margin.         Liquidity and Capital Resources         At December 31, 2002, we had $859,000 in cash and cash equivalents as compared to $869,000 at December 31, 2001. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is attributed to modest increases in fixed assets and patent filing expenditures. We had working capital of $1,125,000 at December 31, 2002 as compared with working capital of $1,124,000 at December 31, 2001. Our future cash flow will come primarily from the audio signal processing licensing, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) royalties and from possible common stock issuances including warrants and options. We are actively engaged in negotiations for additional audio signal processing licensing arrangements which should generate additional cash flow without imposing any substantial costs on the Company. We anticipate that there will be a wind down of our licensing program in early 2003 with a large computer account as that entity completes its migration to its latest operating system. We added or expanded our relationships with JVC, Sanyo, Orion and Mediatech this past year. We believe that growth from these and other licensing arrangements including some that are pending but not announced or in negotiation, will substantially offset any revenue shortfalls from the computer account by the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Mediatech, in particular, has been successful in penetrating the DVD market and our relationship with them positions us well as the audio solutions provider of choice in these new accounts for 2003 and 2004. Further, by the second half of 2003, we expect to begin generating revenues from the Company's new products that were introduced in 2002.        Like other operating enterprises, the events of September 11, 2001 in the United States brought a degree of uncertainty to our operations and hindered our ability to plan and meet with our contractual partners outside the United States in this dynamic environment. The operations of our business, and those of our competitors, may also be impacted by the continued trend in the   14       semiconductor industry to offer free, but minimal audio solutions to certain product classes to maintain and attract market share. This challenges our ability to convert business opportunities to licensing agreements in those segments that allow us to maintain or rapidly increase revenue. As a result, the Company must develop and license its products and software solutions in a market that treats some audio products, including those of our competitors, on a commodity basis in those cases where the OEM product is considered a commodity product. While our software applications deliver what we and most manufacturers who listen to it believe is a significantly superior audio experience, the competitive market forces that pressure manufacturers to reduce their costs may create some resistance to new technology adoption or use. In addition, certain of our competitors appear to be pursuing a business plan that disregards commercially reasonable pricing to achieve a larger market penetration even if the penetration will not provide for viable margins or returns. The Company has responded by offering additional products targeted to each price/quality segment of the market and continues to aggressively pursue new opportunities in emerging product categories and complements to our existing core business. In addition, our products have been positioned as a means for manufacturers to save money while delivering an enhanced audio experience. Nevertheless, these market conditions and competitive forces make it more challenging for the Company, and its rational commercial competitors, to enhance their operating results.        To the extent the Company maintains or exceeds its projected revenues and is not required to fund contingencies, it expects to continue to retain its current cash reserves and therefore, maintain its liquidity position at a consistent level both on a short-term and long-term basis. To the extent that the Company does not achieve current operating levels or is required to fund contingencies, it will be required to use some of its cash reserves and this could impact its longer term liquidity. In addition, we wish to achieve accelerated growth and to take advantage of the dynamic market forces in which we operate, rather than to be affected by them. To address these objectives, we retained Neveric Capital, a San Francisco based investment banking firm, to identify and evaluate strategic opportunities and to explore alternatives to enhance stockholder value and support the Company's growth and overall strategy.        In December 1999, we completed a set of financial transactions (the 1999 Transactions) with certain existing holders of our equity and debt and with new institutional investors. The 1999 Transactions included the private placement of 1,884,254 additional shares of our Common Stock ($1.05 million in new capital or $0.56 per share), the issuance of warrants to acquire 2,100,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable for three years at an exercise price of $.67 per share), the cancellation of 500,000 warrants to acquire Common Stock issued in an earlier financing, the conversion of $1 million of short term debt into a new Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) and the conversion of $225,000 of secured debt into secured convertible debt.        In the 1999 Transactions, $895,000 in short term loan advances from officers, directors and their affiliates and certain other securities holders, and accrued interest of $134,647, were restructured into the $1,000,000 in new Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock, and any dividends therefrom not converted into cash, were convertible commencing in 2001 into restricted Common Stock at a 10% discount, based on the 10 day average closing bid price prior to the conversion, but subject to a minimum conversion of $.56 per share and a maximum of $1.12 per share. The Company had an option to redeem with cash any Series B Preferred Stock not converted before the end of 2002 and to pay Series B Preferred Stock accrued and declared cumulative dividends of 10%. In November 2002, the Board of Directors and the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, agreed to exchange the Series B Preferred Stock for a new Series B-1 Preferred Stock which had terms substantially the same as the Series B Preferred Stock, except that the conversion date was deferred to December 2005, no future dividends will accrue and dividends for prior periods on the Series B Preferred Stock were reset and recalculated to the LIBOR rate in effect on the first business day of each of 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively and were paid through the issuance of the appropriate number of shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock. The exchange was completed in December 2002. The 500,000 warrants issued in the 1999 Transactions expired, without exercise in December 2002. In connection with the exchange the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, we withdrew the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock and, therefore, currently the Series B-1 Preferred Stock is our only authorized or outstanding class of preferred stock.        As noted above, in the 1999 Transactions, $225,000 of secured debt, including accrued interest, was converted into secured long term convertible debt. The long term debt was repaid with interest in 2001. We currently have a related party obligation of $112,500 which bears interest of 10% per annum, which we pay on a current basis. The debt is due on demand.        We eliminated Net Liabilities of Discontinued Operation since the statute of limitations for claims has been exceeded. We continue to maintain an accrual for unasserted claims or settlement costs related to the discontinuation of MDT in 1999. We do not expect any final liability to be in excess of this balance.        Funds generated by these financing activities as well as cash generated from our existing operations and customer base is expected to be sufficient for us to meet our operating obligations and the anticipated additional research and development for our audio technology business. The Company will also continue to consider and evaluate capital investment or business arrangements with financial or strategic participants or investors as such opportunities become available to the Company on terms that enhance shareholder value and support the Companys business strategy.        To the extent the Company maintains or exceeds its projected revenues and is not required to fund significant contingencies, it expects to continue to retain its current cash reserves and therefore, maintain its liquidity position at a consistent level both on a short-term and long-term basis. To the extent that the Company does not achieve current operating levels or is required to fund contingencies, it will be required to use some of its cash reserves and this could impact its longer term liquidity.   15            Net Operating Loss Carry forwards         At December 31, 2002, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately $26,000,000 which are available to offset future Federal taxable income, if any, through 2013. Approximately $21,700,000 of these net operating loss carry forwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $1,000,000.         Inflation         We believe that the moderate inflation rate of the last several years has not impacted our operations.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, which establishes financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes APB Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations, and FASB statement No. 38, Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for using one method, the purchase method. The provisions apply to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.        In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which establishes financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets (but not those acquired in a business combination) should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition, and after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. The provisions of SFAS no. 142 were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We adopted SFAS No. 142 during the first quarter of fiscal 2002, and the adoption of SFAS No. 142 had no material impact on our financial reporting and related disclosures.        In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which is effective for us beginning fiscal 2003. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, with the associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.        In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and interim periods within those fiscal periods. SFAS No. 144 supersedes FASB Statement No. 121 and parts of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations  Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions Relating to Extraordinary Items. However, SFAS No. 144 retains the requirement of APB Opinion No. 30 to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of (by sale, by abandonment or in a distribution to owners) or is classified as held for sale. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.        In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which nullifies EITF Issue 94-3. SFAS 146 is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred in contrast to the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan, as required by EITF Issue 94-3. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.        In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation an amendment to SFAS 123. SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 for transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions; for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002 for interim disclosure provisions. The adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        We have not been exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on our short-term investments at December 31, 2002. A hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in interest rate (ten percent of our overall earnings rate) would not result in a material fluctuation in future earnings or cash flow. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or for speculative purposes and we are not currently evaluating the future use of such financial instruments.   16      INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT   To the Board of Directors Of Spatializer Audio Laboratories, Inc.:        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Spatializer Audio Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries (The Company) as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.        We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.        In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Spatializer Audio Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 in conformity with generally accepted accounting policies in the United States of America.   /s/   FARBER & HASS LLP   Oxnard, California  March 18, 2003   17        Item 8.
