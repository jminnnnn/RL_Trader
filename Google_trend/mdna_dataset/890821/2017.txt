As a result of the Merger, Ameri and Partners became our wholly owned operating subsidiary.  The Merger was consummated under Delaware law, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in connection with the Merger we changed our name to AMERI Holdings, Inc. We are headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey.      Overview     We specialize in delivering SAP TM  cloud and digital enterprise services to clients worldwide. Our SAP focus allows us to provide technological solutions to a broad and growing base  of clients . We are headquartered in Princeton, NJ, and  we  have offices across the United States, which are supported by offices in India. Our model inverts the conventional global delivery model wherein offshore information technology ("IT") service providers are based abroad and maintain a minimal presence in the United States. With a strong SAP focus, our client partnerships anchor around SAP cloud services, artificial intelligence, internet of things and robotic process automation. We pursue an acquisition strategy that seeks to disrupt the established business model of offshore IT service providers.    We generate revenue by providing consulting services under written service contracts with our customers. The service contracts we enter into generally fall into two categories:  ( 1) time-and-materials  contracts  and  ( 2) fixed-price  contracts .     When a customer enters into a time-and-materials or fixed-price (or a periodic retainer-based) contract, the revenue is recognized in accordance with the deliverables of each contract. If the deliverables involve separate units of accounting, the consideration from the arrangement is measured and allocated to the separate units, based on vendor specific objective evidence of the value for each deliverable.                                         - 28 -              The revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates. Revenue pursuant to fixed-price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting.  We routinely evaluate whether revenue and profitability should be recognized in the current period. We estimate the proportional performance on fixed-price contracts on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project.    For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, sales to five major customers, accounted for 52.75% of our total revenue.    Matters that May or Are Currently Affecting Our Business    The main challenges and trends that could affect or are affecting our financial results include:        ·   Our ability to enter into additional technology-management and consulting agreements, to diversify our client base and to expand the geographic areas we serve;          ·   Our ability to attract competent, skilled professionals and on-demand technology partners for our operations at acceptable prices to manage our overhead;          ·   Our ability to acquire other technology services companies and integrate them with our existing business;          ·   Our ability to raise additional equity capital, if and when we needed; and          ·   Our ability to control our costs of operation as we expand our organization and capabilities.           Result of Operations    Results of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015               Twelve Months  Ended  December 31,                 2016          2015                                  Net revenue       $    36,145,589          $    20,261,172         Cost of revenue          29,608,932             13,391,504         Gross  profit          6,536,657             6,869,668                                      Operating expenses:                              Selling and marketing          417,249             119,847         General and  administration          8,552,966             5,721,633         Nonrecurring expenditures          1,585,136             1,655,962         Depreciation and amortization          1,361,169             166,208         Operating expenses          11,916,520             7,663,650                                      Operating income (loss):          (5,379,863    )          (793,982    )                                     Interest expense          (751,074    )          (238,471    )      Interest income /other income          -             89,918         Other income          16,604             -                                                                   Change due to estimate correction          (410,817    )          -         Total other income (expenses)          (1,145,287    )          (148,553    )      Net income (loss) before income taxes          (6,525,150    )          (942,535    )      Income tax benefit (provision)          3,747,846             128,460         Net income (loss)          (2,777,304    )          (814,075    )           Non-controlling interest          (3,382    )          -         Net income (loss) attributable to the Company          (2,780,686    )          (814,075    )                                   Foreign exchange translation adjustment          (7,426    )          -         Comprehensive  income (loss)       $    (2,788,112    )      $    (814,075    )          Revenues    Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 increased by 78% from the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 to $36,145,589. Approximately 60% of this increase is directly attributable to the acquisitions that we made in 2016. DCM added approximately $7.65 million to our 2016 revenues. Similarly, Virtuoso and Bigtech added approximately $1.14 million and $520,000, respectively, to revenues. In addition, we acquired Ameri Georgia in late 2015 and only received four months of revenue from Ameri Georgia that year, while in 2016 we received a full year of revenue from Ameri Georgia.    Our top five customers accounted for 52.75 % of our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. We derived 98% of our revenues from our customers located in North America for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.     Gross Margin    Our gross margin was $6,536,657, or 18.1%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $6,869,668, or 33.9%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The change in gross margin for 2016 was a result of lower margins for professional services and a decrease in project revenues in 2016 than in 2015.            - 29 -             Selling and Marketing Expenses     Selling and marketing expenses were $417,249 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $119,847 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in selling and marketing expenses was directly attributable to the addition of Ameri Georgia's selling and marketing expenses in 2016, following its acquisition in late 2015.     General and  Administration  Expenses    General and  Administration  ("G&A") expenses include all costs, including rent costs, which are not directly associated with revenue-generating activities, as well as the non-cash expense for stock based compensation. These include employee costs, corporate costs and facilities costs. Employee costs include administrative salaries and related employee benefits, travel, recruiting and training costs. Corporate costs include reorganization costs, legal, accounting and outside consulting fees. Facilities costs primarily include rent and communications costs.     G&A expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $8,552,966 as compared to $5,721,633 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Our G&A expense growth was moderated by cost synergies, including consolidating offshore teams for finance, recruitment and human resources.    Nonrecurring Expenses    Nonrecurring expenditures of $1,585,136 occurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and are primarily costs and expenses that are unlikely to occur again in the normal course of business. These expenditures included legal, banking and subscription fees and other acquisition related costs. Increased legal costs were incurred as a result of various acquisition related activities as well as the additional incremental costs or pursuing additional acquisitions.    Our nonrecurring expenses consisted of the following:        ·   $53,288 for an event in connection with integrating all acquired subsidiaries with the Company;          ·   $229,440 for fees in connection with terminating our prior credit facility and replacing it with our current credit facility with Sterling National Bank;          ·   $312,500 for payments to a financial advisor for its assistance in obtaining our current credit facility with Sterling National Bank;          ·   $349,902 for  earn-out  payments to the former owners of Ameri Georgia; and          ·   $640,006 for legal fees in connection with our acquisitions.        All of the foregoing expenses were specific to events of the Company that occurred in 2016 and we do not expect further ongoing expenses with those events.      Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $1,361,169 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $166,208 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.   We capitalized the customer lists received from each of our acquisitions during 2016, resulting in increased amortization costs. The customer lists from each acquisition are amortized over a period of 60 months.     Our amortization schedule is as follows:            Years ending December 31,       Amount                          2017       $    2,464,184         2018          2,115,592         2019          1,748,250         2020          1,621,000         2021          815,678         Total       $    8,764,704             Operating income     Our operating income percentage was (14.9) % for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to (3.9) % for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. This change was mainly due to an increase in selling and marketing, G&A expenses and nonrecurring expenditures.      Income taxes    Our benefit for income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 amounted to approximately $3,747,846 and $128,460, respectively.                   - 30 -            Liquidity and Capital Resources      Our cash position was $1,379,887 as of December 31, 2016, as compared to $1,878,034 as of December 31, 2015, a decrease of $498,147 primarily the result of working capital expenditures.       Cash used in operating activities was $( 2,703,989 ) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and was primarily a result of net increases from working capital requirements. Cash used in investing activities was $( 6,592,062 ) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to acquisitions and assets purchased for the purpose of providing future revenues. Cash provided by financing activities was $ 8,797,904  during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and was attributable to issuance of the convertible note and additional collateralized debt issuances.    On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into that certain Loan and Security Agreement (the "Loan Agreement"), with its wholly-owned subsidiaries Ameri and Partners and Ameri Georgia, as borrowers, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Linear Logics, Corp. and WinHire Inc serving as guarantors, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Giri Devanur, serving as a validity guarantor, and Sterling National Bank, N.A. (as lender and as agent). The Company joined DCM, Virtuoso and ATCG as borrowers under the Loan Agreement following their respective acquisition.      Under the Loan Agreement, the borrowers are able to borrow up to an aggregate of $10 million, which includes up to $8 million in principal for revolving loans for general working capital purposes, up to $2 million in principal pursuant to a term loan for the purpose of a permitted business acquisition and up to $200,000 for letters of credit. A portion of the proceeds of the Loan Agreement were also used to repay the November 20, 2015 credit facility that was entered into among the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Ameri Georgia and Federal National Payables, Inc.      The Loan Agreement has a term of three years, which will automatically renew unless a written notice of termination is given by the Borrowers or Sterling to the other at least 60 days prior to the end of the original or any renewed term.  Our outstanding balance with Sterling National Bank for the Term Loan and Revolving Loans was $1.9 and $4.85 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.  Due to our 2016 acquisitions, we did not fulfill certain of the financial covenants contained in our Loan Agreement with Sterling National Bank as of December 31, 2016; however, Sterling National Bank has agreed to waive our compliance with such covenants in exchange for the payment of a fee.      For the purpose of financing the ongoing business and operations of our company, on April 20, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Dhruwa N. Rai, pursuant to which Mr. Rai purchased 500,000 unregistered shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, from us at a price per share of $6.00 for aggregate consideration to us of $3,000,000.       On May 13, 2016, LSVI completed an early partial exercise of its Original Warrant for 1,111,111 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.80 per share, for total consideration to us of $2,000,000, and LSVI was issued a replacement warrant for the remaining 1,166,666 shares under the Original Warrant on the same terms as the Original Warrant.      On March 7, 2017, we completed the sale and issuance of the 2017 Notes for aggregate proceeds to us of $1,250,000 from four accredited investors, including one of the Company's directors, Dhruwa N. Rai. The 2017 Notes were issued pursuant to Securities Purchase Agreements  between the Company and  each investor. The 2017 Notes bear interest at 8% per annum until maturity in March 2020, with interest being paid annually on the first, second and third anniversaries of the issuance of the 2017 Notes beginning in March 2018. From and after an event of default and for so long as the event of default is continuing, the 2017 Notes will bear default interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The 2017 Notes can be prepaid by us at any time without penalty.                 - 31 -             The 2017 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of (i) in the event that any registration statement for the public offering of common stock filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with an uplisting to a national stock exchange is declared effective by the SEC on or prior to December 31, 2017, such price per share that is equal to 68% of the price per share of common stock offered and sold pursuant to such registration statement, or (ii) if no such registration statement is declared effective by December 31, 2017, such price per share that is equal to the weighted average closing price per share of the Company's common stock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding December 31, 2017, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2017 Notes rank junior to our secured credit facility with Sterling National Bank. The 2017 Notes also include certain negative covenants including, without the investors' approval, restrictions on dividends and other restricted payments and reclassification of its stock.    Operating Activities    Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers for different information technology services we render under various statements of work. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures, leased facilities and taxes.    Future Sources of Liquidity    We expect our primary source of cash to be positive net cash flows provided by operating activities. We also continue to focus on cost reductions and have initiated steps to reduce overheads and provide cash savings.    Based on past performance and current expectations, we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and our ongoing cash flows that are not deemed permanently reinvested, to be sufficient to meet our operating liquidity requirements described above for at least the 12 months following the date of this report.    We may raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities or borrowings from financial institutions or third parties or a combination of the foregoing. Capital raised will be used to implement our business plan, grow current operations, make acquisitions or start new vertical businesses among some of the possible uses.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.    Seasonality    Our operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations. However, our consultants' billable hours are affected by national holidays and vacation policies, which vary by country.    Climate Change    We do not believe there is anything unique to our business which would result in climate change regulations having a disproportional effect on us as compared to U.S. industry overall.    Impact of Inflation    We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, we attempt to minimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and, whenever possible, seeking to ensure that billing rates reflect increases in costs due to inflation.    For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each period end. Statements of Operations accounts are translated at the exchange rate prevailing as of the date of the transaction. The gains or losses resulting from such translation are reported under accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. Realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income, net for the periods presented.           - 32 -              Critical Accounting Policies    Purchase Price Allocation.  We allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Some of the items, including accounts receivable, property and equipment, other intangible assets, certain accrued liabilities and other reserves require a degree of management judgment. Certain estimates may change as additional information becomes available. Goodwill is assigned at the enterprise level and is deductible for tax purposes for certain types of acquisitions. Management finalizes the purchase price allocation within the defined measurement period of the acquisition date as certain initial accounting estimates are resolved.    Valuation of Contingent Earn-out Consideration.  Acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on the achievement of certain future financial performance measures of the acquired company. Contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, however, there is significant judgment involved. We evaluate, on a routine, periodic basis, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration and changes in estimated fair value, subsequent to the initial fair value estimate at the time of the acquisition, will be reflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria. Any changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration may have a material impact on our operating results.    Revenue Recognition.  We recognize revenue in accordance with the Accounting Standard Codification 605 "Revenue Recognition." Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the seller's price to buyer is fixed and determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from information technology services as the services are provided. Service revenues are recognized based on contracted hourly rates, as services are rendered or upon completion of specified contracted services and acceptance by the customer.    Accounts Receivable.  We extend credit to clients based upon management's assessment of their credit-worthiness on an unsecured basis. We provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience and management evaluation of trend analysis. We include any balances that are determined to be uncollectible in allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for uncollectible accounts as of December 31, 2016 was $0 and the allowance as of December 31, 2015 was $409,749. Based on the information available, management believes our accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, are collectible.    Property and Equipment.  Property and equipment is stated at cost. We provide for depreciation of property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from 3 to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease terms or the useful lives of the improvements. We charge repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to expenses as incurred.    We account for computer software costs developed for internal use in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States, which require companies to capitalize certain qualifying costs during the application development stage of the related software development project and to exclude the initial planning phase that determines performance requirements, most data conversion, general and administrative costs related to payroll and training costs incurred. Whenever a software program is considered operational, we consider the project to be completed, place it into service and commence amortization of the development cost in the succeeding month.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements     On November 17, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which is intended to reduce diversity in the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included as components of total cash and cash equivalents as presented on the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years, but earlier adoption is permitted.  We do not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.              - 33 -              In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies and provides a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted for acquisition or deconsolidation transactions occurring before the issuance date or effective date and only when the transactions have not been reported in issued or made available for issuance financial statements. We do not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. Under this new standard, goodwill impairment would be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. This ASU eliminates existing guidance that requires an entity to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment test performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.           ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK              As a "smaller reporting company," we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
