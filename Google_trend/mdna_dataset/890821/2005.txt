Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Executive Overview          Revenues decreased to $1,106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $1,269,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 13%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer® audio signal processing algorithms. A key issue discussed is the difficulty in obtaining revenue traction when traditional revenue sources are eroding, while being replaced by new revenue sources at a lower rate.        Net loss was $157,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004; ($0.00) basic per share, compared to net loss of $495,000, ($0.01) per share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net loss for the current period is primarily the result of lower revenue, partially offset by lower overhead. A key issue discussed is managements efforts to reduce overhead is view of declining revenue, while maintaining competitiveness.        Net cash provided by operating activities was $343,939 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $253,965 for the year ended December 31, 2003 and net cash provided by operating activities of $85,138 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in cash flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily a result of the increase in deferred income, a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by the net loss. Deferred income increased due to the licensing prepayment and accounts receivable decreased a portion of fourth quarter 2004 revenues being realized through the recognition of deferred income. A key issue is the Companys ability to generate continued positive cash flow, or if needed, raise additional capital to fund its business.        The business environment in which we operate is highly competitive and is offers substantial risk. These risks should be studied and understood, as outlined in Risk Factors later in this document.   Approach to MD&A          An important demonstration of our commitment to our stockholders is a clear explanation of the Companys operating results, risks and opportunities. The purpose of MD&A is to provide our shareholders and other interested parties with information necessary to gain an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. As such, we seek to satisfy three principal objectives:                    to provide a narrative explanation of a companys financial statements in plain English that enables the average investor to see the company through the eyes of management;                         to enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which financial information should be analyzed; and                         to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, a companys earnings and cash flow, so that investors can ascertain the likelihood that and relationship of past performance being indicative of future performance.            We believe the best way to achieve this is to give the reader:                    An understanding of our operating environment and its risks                         An outline of critical accounting policies                         A review of our corporate governance structure      13                          A review of the key components of the financial statements and our cash position and capital resources                         A review of the important trends in the financial statements and our cash flow                         Disclosure on our internal controls and procedures       Operating Environment          We operate in a very competitive business environment. This environment impacts us in the following ways, further discussed in greater detail under  Risk Factors :                    We Face Significant Pricing Pressure and Competition that can Result in Our Technology Being Designed Out Within a Short Time Frame, or Impeding Efforts to Secure New Design Wins                         New Customer Product Development Can be Delayed. This Results in Delays In Revenues. Further, Where our Products are Delayed, Competitive Products May Reach The Market Before, or Replace Our Products.                         We Rely on the Schedules and Cooperation of Chip Makers or Other Third Parties to Deliver Our Technology in Consumer Products. These Third parties Have Their Own Priorities and Alliances that May Delay or Thwart our Sales Efforts to Potential Customers.      The PC and consumer electronics markets are under intense pressure, primarily from retailers, to reduce selling prices, with resultant pressure to reduce costs. In addition, pricing action by our competitors may be very aggressive. Cost reductions are driven by lower cost sourcing, often in China, design simplification and reduction in or substitution of features. While we present a value proposition that stresses the cost reducing capabilities of our audio solutions through improved performance from lower cost components as well as product differentiation that Spatializer technology can deliver, all such features are closely scrutinized by potential customers product marketing and engineering. This makes it more challenging to secure new design wins, particularly in product categories that have become commoditized, such as the case with DVD players. It also may result in the elimination of features, including ours, if cost is of paramount importance. When this occurs, we receive very short notice and revenues from such an account will typically begin a steep decline in the subsequent quarter, resulting in period-to-period fluctuation. This also results limited visibility with regard to future revenues and their impact on our operating results. Our response has been to strengthen our value proposition, more aggressively price and include additional features in our products. We have also entered new segments, such as cell phones, with different competitive pressure. We also emphasize to our overseas sales representatives the need for close customer support, with the objective that both new opportunities and possible difficulties are brought to light as soon as possible.   Manufacturers design-in cycles for our technology range from four to twelve months, from the decision to adopt our technology to actual cashflow. Many of our customers operate under very fluid development schedules. These schedules are prone to delays at the manufacturer level and in some cases, manufacturers new products may be cancelled due to market testing or resource allocation. Since these events are beyond our control, it is difficult to absolutely project when new deals will begin generating revenues or if signed deals will generate financial results. For this reason, we do not typically announce new deals until the target product is being introduced.   Spatializer does not develop or market semiconductors. That is why we carry no inventory or have order backlogs that typically are good indicators of near term performance. Rather, we develop audio algorithms that are embedded on third party processors or semiconductors used by our customers. Whether such processors become an industry standard, or gain wide acceptance in the market, is speculative. While our algorithms are implemented on a wide array of processors, often times a customer uses a processor where there is no such implementation, or where a competing solution has been implemented. In this case, our customers must request that our algorithm be implemented. While these requests may be honored, processor manufacturers must schedule such implementation as their resources or corporate strategies allow. Some chip makers, particularly in the cell phone market, have already incorporated solutions from our competitors as a component of the chip itself, making it costly and time consuming to implement alternate solutions like ours. Therefore, the supply-chain is often quite long and complicated, which potentially can result in delays or deadlines that may not always coincide with our customers requirements and which are beyond the control of our company.   Therefore, when reviewing the operating results or drawing conclusions with regard to future performance, these competitive forces and uncertainties must be taken into consideration. Without absolute long-term visibility, it is difficult to draw such conclusions in absolute terms. Further, the dynamic nature of the business environment creates the potential for both positive and negative     14         fluctuations in near and long term operating performance. While management strives to mitigate these risks, as outlined in  Risk Factors,  it is not possible to be fully immune from such dynamics.    Critical Accounting Policies          Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In consultation with our Board of Directors and Audit Committee, we have identified three accounting policies that we believe are critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These are important accounting policies that require managements most difficult, subjective judgments.        The first critical accounting policy relates to revenue recognition. We recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to the customer. License revenues are recognized when earned, in accordance with the contractual provisions. Royalty revenues are recognized upon shipment of products incorporating the related technology by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and foundries. These revenues are reported to us by our Licensees in formal, written royalty reports, which serve as the basis for our quarterly revenue accruals. Infrequently, certain written reports are received after our required reporting deadlines, sometimes due to contractual requirements. In such cases, management tries to obtain verbal reports or informal reports from the Licensee. In the absence of such information, management may utilize conservative estimates based on information received or historical trends. In such isolated cases, management strives to under-estimate such revenues to err on the side of caution. In the event such estimates are used, the revenue for the following quarter is adjusted based on receipt of the written report. In addition, any error in Licensee reporting, which is very infrequent, is adjusted in the subsequent quarter when agreed by both parties as correct.        The second critical accounting policy relates to research and development expenses. We expense all research and development expenses as incurred. Costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of our algorithms (which is the primary component of our licensing) is expensed as incurred and included in Research and Development expenses. Such algorithms are refined based on customer requirements and licensed for inclusion in the customers specific product. There are no production costs to capitalize as defined in Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 86.        The third critical accounting policy relates to intangible assets. Our intangible assets consist primarily of patents. We capitalize all costs directly attributable to patents and trademarks, consisting primarily of legal and filing fees, and amortize such costs over the remaining life of the asset (which range from 3 to 20 years) using the straight-line method. In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, only intangible assets with definite lives are amortized. Non-amortized intangible assets are instead subject to annual impairment testing.   Corporate Governance           Audit Committee         This committee, chaired by Mr. Gilbert Segel, is directed to review the scope, cost and results of the independent audit of our books and records, the results of the annual audit with management and the internal auditors and the adequacy of our accounting, financial, and operating controls; to recommend annually to the Board of Directors the selection of the independent auditors; to approve proposals made by our independent auditors for consulting work; and to report to the Board of Directors, when so requested, on any accounting of financial matters.         Compensation and Stock Committee         Our Compensation and Stock Option Committee (the Compensation Committee) currently consists of Messrs. Pace and Segel, each of whom is a non-employee director of the Company and a disinterested person with respect to the plans administered by such committee, as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, the Exchange Act). The Compensation Committee reviews and approves annual salaries, bonuses and other forms and items of compensation for our senior officers and employees. Except for plans that are, in accordance with their terms or as required by law, administered by the Board of Directors or another particularly designated group, the Compensation Committee also administers and implements all of our stock option and other stock-based and equity-based benefit plans (including performance-based plans), recommends changes or additions to those plans or awards under the plans.   15       Our Audit Committee and Compensation and Stock Committee charters are available in print to any stockholder upon request in writing to our principal executive office at 2625 Townsgate Road, Suite 330, Westlake Village, California 91361.    Key Components of the Financial Statements and Important Trends          The financial statements, including Balance Sheet, results of operations, cash flow and Changes in Stockholders Equity should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. MD&A explains the key components of each of these financial statements, key trends and reasons for reporting period-to-period fluctuations.        The Balance Sheet provides a snapshot view of our financial condition at the end of our fiscal year. A balance sheet helps management and our stockholders understand the financial strength and capabilities of our business. Balance sheets can help identify and analyze trends, particularly in the area of receivables and payables. A review of cash compared to the comparable year and in relation to ongoing profit or loss can show the ability of the Company to withstand business variations. The relationship between Current Assets and Current Liabilities Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) measures how much in liquid assets a company has available to build its business . The presence of Deferred Revenue indicates cash received on revenue to be earned over the next twelve months. Receivables that are substantially higher than revenue for the quarter may indicate a slowdown of collections, with an impact on future cash position. This is addressed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.         The Consolidated Statement of Operations tells the reader whether the Company had a profit or loss. It shows key sources of revenue and major expense categories. It is important to note period-to-period comparisons of each line item of this statement, reasons for any fluctuation and how costs are managed in relation to the overall revenue trend of the business. These statements are prepared using accrual accounting under generally accepted accounting standards. This is addressed further in MD&A under Revenues and Expenses.        The Consolidated Statement of Cashflows explains the actual sources and uses of cash. Some expenses of the Company, such as depreciation and amortization do not result in a cash outflow in the current period, since the underlying patent expenditure or asset purchase was made years earlier. New capital expenditures, on the other hand, resulted in a disbursement of cash, but will be expensed in the Statement of Operations over its useful life. Fluctuations in Receivables and payables also explain why the net change in cash is not equal to the loss reported on the Statement of Operations. Therefore, it is possible that the impact of a net loss on cash is less or more than the actual amount of the loss. This is discussed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.              The Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity shows the impact of the operating results on the Companys equity. In addition, this statement shows new equity brought into the Company through stock sales or stock option exercise. This is discussed further in MD&A under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.     Results of Operations          The following discussion and analysis relates to our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, and the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.   For the Year Ended December 31, 2004, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003           Revenues         Revenues decreased to $1,106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $1,269,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 13%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer® audio signal processing algorithms.        While the overall decrease was relatively modest, the revenue mix by licensee platform was significantly different year over year. The decrease in revenues is attributed primarily to the loss or reduction at three key DVD player accounts and one PC account which in aggregate, generated approximately 56% of total fiscal 2003 revenue. In each case, these licensees decided to use no licensed virtual surround solution or opted for a free solution from their chip supplier, driven primarily by cost reduction pressure. These losses   16       were partially offset by three new revenue sources in cellular phones, mobile audio semiconductors and PCs, and the expansion of an existing license relating to recordable DVD.          Gross Profit         Gross profit decreased to $995,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $1,147,000 in the comparable period last year, a decrease of 13%. Gross margin held steady at 90% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with 90% of revenue for the comparable period last year. The decrease in gross profit results from lower revenues in the current year We maintain a high margin since revenues are from licensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated direct manufacturing or selling costs other than commissions paid to our independent representatives that solicit and oversee the particular accounts. All development costs are expensed as engineering and development expenses in the period they are incurred.         Operating Expenses         Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased to $1,146,000 (105% of sales) from $1,631,000 (128% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 30%. The decrease in operating expenses results primarily from reductions in general and administrative expense and sales and marketing expense. General and Administrative expenses declined due to the relocation to smaller and less expensive offices in December 2003 and lower occupancy-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses declined due to the elimination of a marketing and business development executive position and related travel in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the restructuring of our Japan sales operation. These responsibilities were transferred to another executive and to a new commissioned representative firm in Japan.         General and Administrative         General and administrative expense decreased to $615,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $811,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 24%. The decrease is primarily due to the relocation of our offices to smaller and lower cost facilities in December 2003, upon expiration of an existing lease, lower occupancy related expenses, partially offset by increased legal and accounting expenses related to public filings, in part in response to the additional requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and increased travel by the CEO. General operating costs include rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery, postage, depreciation and similar costs.         Research and Development         Research and Development costs decreased to $393,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $459,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 14%. The decrease in research and development expense was due to the commencement of the use of lower cost specialist consultants in India in the second half of 2004.        We continued efforts to identify, validate, and develop new product ideas at DPI. Specific engineering efforts were directed toward the launch of Spatializer Audio Alchemy, refinement of Spatializer Natural Headphone, development of new cell phone solutions and applications engineering to port our technology to leading processor platforms.         Sales and Marketing         Sales and Marketing costs decreased to $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $361,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 62%. The reduction in such expenses resulted from the elimination of a sales consultant position, the elimination of a sales executive position in the third quarter of 2003 and fewer trade show participations.         Net Income (Loss)         Net loss was $157,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004; ($0.00) basic per share, compared to net loss of $495,000, ($0.01) per share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net loss for the current period is primarily the result of lower revenue, partially offset by lower overhead.   17        For the Year Ended December 31, 2003, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002           Revenues         Revenues decreased to $1,269,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $1,856,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of 32%. Revenues are almost entirely comprised of royalties pertaining to the licensing of Spatializer® audio signal processing algorithms.        The decrease in revenues is attributed primarily to the loss or reduction at two key accounts which generated in excess of 20% of total revenue each, partially offset by revenue from a new account. The first lost account was in the PC market, which completed its migration to a new operating system in which it chose not to include any software audio enhancements. The second account was in the DVD player market, where it selected a lower cost solution for its low cost, high volume DVD players.         Gross Profit         Gross profit decreased to $1,147,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $1,725,000 in the comparable period last year, a decrease of 34%. Gross margin decreased to 90% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with 93% of revenue for the comparable period last year. The decrease in gross profit results from lower revenues in the current year and from lower gross margin. The decrease in the gross margin percentage reflects a change in mix to commissionable foreign royalty revenue compared to non-commissionable U.S. sourced revenue. We maintain a high margin since revenues are from licensing and royalty activities, which have little or no associated direct manufacturing or selling costs other than commissions paid to our independent representatives that solicit and oversee the particular accounts.         Operating Expenses         Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased to $1,631,000 (128% of sales) from $1,711,000 (92% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of 5%. The decrease in operating expenses results primarily from reductions in sales and marketing due to the elimination of a marketing and business development executive position and related travel in late 2003. These responsibilities were transferred to another executive and to a new representative firm in Japan.        In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we implemented a cost reduction program that included the elimination of an executive position, relocation of the corporate offices to smaller and lower cost facilities, replacement of a stipended representative with a commissioned representative and other overhead related cost savings. The annualized reduction to be provided by these initiatives is expected to result in an overall overhead reduction of at least 20%.         General and Administrative         General and administrative costs increased to $811,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $766,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of 6%. The increase is primarily due to increased legal expenses related to public filings, in part in response to the additional requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and increased travel by the CEO. General operating costs include rent, telephone, legal, public filing, office supplies and stationery, postage, depreciation and similar costs.         Research and Development         Research and Development costs increased to $459,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $433,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of 6%. The increase in research and development expense was due to strategic use of outside specialist consultants, wage increases and increased health insurance premiums for such personnel.        We continued efforts to identify, validate, and develop new product ideas at DPI. Specific engineering efforts were directed toward   18       the launch of Spatializer Audio Alchemy, refinement of Spatializer Natural Headphone, development of the HD Series of whole product solutions and applications engineering to port our technology to leading processor platforms.          Sales and Marketing         Sales and Marketing costs decreased to $361,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $513,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of 30%. The reduction in such expenses resulted from the elimination of a sales consultant position, the elimination of a sales executive position in the third quarter of 2003 and fewer trade show participations.         Net Income (Loss)         Net loss was $495,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003; ($0.01) basic per share, compared to net income of $18,000, ($0.00) per share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net loss for the current period is primarily the result of lower gross margin, partially offset by lower overhead.   Liquidity and Capital Resources          At December 31, 2004, we had $871,000 in cash and cash equivalents as compared to $590,000 at December 31, 2003. The increase in cash and cash equivalents is attributed to an increase in deferred revenue resulting from prepayments on a licensing agreement of $391,395, partially offset by the operating loss of $174,103. We had working capital of $586,000 at December 31, 2004 as compared with working capital of $793,000 at December 31, 2003.        Net cash provided by operating activities was $343,939 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $253,965 for the year ended December 31, 2003 and net cash provided by operating activities of $85,138 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in cash flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily a result of the increase in deferred income, a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by the net loss. Deferred income increased due to the licensing prepayment and accounts receivable decreased a portion of fourth quarter 2004 revenues being realized through the recognition of deferred income.        We use cash in investing activities primarily to secure patent and trademark protection for our proprietary technology and brand name, and to purchase short-term investments such as bank certificates of deposit. Cash used in investing activities totaled $20,587, $20,709 and $95,891, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002. All expenditures for on-going research and development are expenses and therefore included in the Net Loss.        Net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $41,994 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and cash provided by financing activities totaled $5,746 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.        In November 2002, the Board of Directors and the holders of our previously outstanding Series B Preferred Stock agreed to exchange the Series B Preferred Stock for a new Series B-1 Preferred Stock, which are convertible commencing in December 2005 into restricted Common Stock at a 10% discount, based on the 10 day average closing bid price prior to the conversion, but subject to a minimum conversion of $.56 per share and a maximum of $1.12 per share. The exchange was completed in December 2002. In connection with the exchange the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, we withdrew the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock and, therefore, currently the Series B-1 Preferred Stock is our only authorized or outstanding class of preferred stock.        In the fourth quarter of 2003, we negotiated and completed the conversion of a $112,500 related party 10% demand note to a three-year 10% term note. Principal and interest of $5,191 is paid monthly, which we pay on a current basis. Since the director who was an indirect beneficiary of the demand note retired from the Board of Directors in June 2003, the demand note is classified as a note payable at December 31, 2004. There are no installments due in more than twelve months as of December 31, 2004.        We continue to maintain an accrual for unasserted claims or settlement costs of approximately $28,000. We do not expect any final liability to be in excess of this balance.   19             Future payments due under operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2004 are described below:                                                                                                                             Payments due by period                                         Less than                                                      More than           Contractual obligations         Total              1 year              1-3 years              3-5 years              5 years              Long-Term Debt Obligations                                                                                                          Capital Lease Obligations                                                                                                          Operating Lease Obligations         $    54,955              $    28,680              $    26,275                                                   Purchase Obligations                                                                                                          Total         $    54,955              $    28,680              $    26,275                                                          Our future cash flow will come primarily from the audio signal processing licensing, OEM royalties and from possible common stock issuances including warrants and options. We are actively engaged in negotiations for additional audio signal processing licensing arrangements which we believe should generate additional cash flow without imposing any substantial costs on us. We anticipate that there may continue to be dislocations of individual licensing programs due to continuing pressure to reduce costs, particularly in the DVD player segment. We currently believe that growth from other licensing arrangements, which include new markets such as cellular phones, and other arrangements that are pending but not announced or in negotiation, will substantially offset any revenue shortfalls from market dynamics or transitioning platforms. The four new or expanded licensing deals from such sources that generated approximately 60% of fiscal 2004 revenue support this belief. Further, our cost reduction initiative implemented in the fourth quarter of 2003 has lowered the revenues needed to reach the break-even point.        The fluid, competitive and dynamic nature of the market continues a degree of uncertainty to our operations. The operations of our business, and those of our competitors, may also be impacted by the continued trend in the semiconductor industry to offer free, but minimal audio solutions to certain product classes to maintain and attract market share. This challenges our ability to convert business opportunities to licensing agreements in those segments that allow us to maintain or rapidly increase revenue. As a result, we must develop and license its products and software solutions in a market that treats some audio products, including those of our competitors, on a commodity basis in those cases where the OEM product is considered a commodity product. While our software applications deliver what we and most manufacturers who listen to it believe is a significantly superior audio experience, the competitive market forces that pressure manufacturers to reduce their costs may create some resistance to new technology adoption or use. In addition, certain of our competitors appear to be pursuing a business plan that disregards commercially reasonable pricing to achieve a larger market penetration even if the penetration will not provide for viable margins or returns. We have responded by offering additional products targeted to each price/quality segment of the market and continue to aggressively pursue new opportunities in emerging product categories such as cellular phones and notebook computers that complements our existing core business. In addition, our products have been positioned as a means for manufacturers to save money while delivering an enhanced audio experience. Nevertheless, these market conditions and competitive forces make it more challenging for us, and our rational commercial competitors, to enhance their operating results.        To the extent we maintain or exceed our projected revenues and are not required to fund significant contingencies, we expect to continue to retain our current cash reserves and therefore, maintain our liquidity position at a consistent level both on a short-term and long-term basis. To the extent that we do not achieve current operating levels or are required to fund contingencies, we will be required to use some of our cash reserves and this could impact our longer term liquidity. In addition, we wish to achieve accelerated growth and to take advantage of the dynamic market forces in which we operate, rather than to be affected by them. We believe our current cash reserves and cash generated from our existing operations and customer base are sufficient for us to meet our operating obligations and the anticipated additional research and development for our audio technology business for at least the next 12 months. We will also continue to consider and evaluate capital investment or business arrangements with financial or strategic participants or investors as such opportunities become available to us on terms that enhance shareholder value and support our business strategy.   Net Operating Loss Carry forwards          At December 31, 2004, we had net operating loss carry forwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately $26,500,000 which are available to offset future Federal taxable income, if any, through 2013. Approximately $21,700,000 of these net operating loss carry forwards is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $1,000,000.   20        In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 132R  Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefitsan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106 . This Statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by FASB Statements No. 87, EmployersAccounting for Pensions,  No. 88,  Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits,  and No. 106,  Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.  This Statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in FASB Statement No. 132,  Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,  which it replaces. It requires additional disclosures to those in the original Statement 132 about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 132R on January 1, 2004. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results from operations or cash flows.    In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  Inventory Costs-an amendment of ARB. No. 43, Chapter 4.  This Statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,  Inventory Pricing , to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that ... under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges.... This Statement requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.   In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 152,  Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions  an amendment of FASB statements no. 66 and 67 . This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 66,  Accounting for Sales of Real Estate , to reference the financial accounting and reporting guidance for real estate time-sharing transactions that is provided in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 04-2,  Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions.  This Statement also amends FASB Statement No. 67,  Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects , to state that the guidance for (a) incidental operations and (b) costs incurred to sell real estate projects does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. The accounting for those operations and costs is subject to the guidance in SOP 04-2.   In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,  Exchanges of Nonmonetary assets  an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.  This Statement amends APB Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.   In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,  Share Based Payment . This Statement is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . This Statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees  and its related implementation guidance. This Statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. The Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in Statement 123 as originally issued and EITF Issue No. 96-18,  Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.    This Statement does not address the accounting for employee share ownership plans, which are subject to AICPA Statement of Position 93-6,  Employers Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans .      Factors That May Affect Future Results          This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, reflecting managements current expectations. Examples of such forward-looking statements include our expectations with respect to our strategy. Although we believe that our expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurances that our financial goals will be realized. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Numerous factors may affect our actual results and may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of our company. For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words, believes, anticipates, plans, expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The important factors discussed under the caption Factors That May Affect Future Results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, herein, among others, would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements made herein and represent managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Investors are warned that actual results may differ from managements expectations. We assume no obligation to update the forward-looking information to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting such forward-looking information.  Our Operating Results Fluctuate and If We Are Unable to Achieve or Sustain Profitability in the Future or Obtain Future Financing Our Business Operations May Fail          We have experienced a loss from operations in three of the last four years. We experienced declining losses in the second and third quarters of 2004, and a profit in the fourth quarter of 2004. While our objective and full effort is on managing a profitable business, due to the market conditions and factors outlined above and below and their impact on fluctuations in operating expenses and revenues,, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to generate a positive profit position in any given future period. We cannot guarantee that we will increase sales of our products and technologies, or that we will successfully develop and market any additional products, or achieve or sustain future profitability, and we may have to rely on the sale of shares or on debt financings in the future, which may have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders. Further, we cannot assure you that debt or equity financing will be available as required and if not available, we would have to further scale down operations or even cease operations.  Because The Market In Which We Operate Is Highly Competitive, We Face Significant Pricing Pressure and Competition.      22                The PC and consumer electronics markets are under intense pressure, primarily from retailers, to reduce selling prices, with resultant pressure to reduce costs. In addition, certain of our competitors appear to be pursuing a business plan that disregards commercially reasonable pricing to achieve a larger market penetration even if the penetration will not provide for viable margins or returns. Cost reductions are driven by lower cost sourcing, often in China, design simplification and reduction in or substitution of features. Therefore, we are seeking commercial acceptance of our products in highly competitive markets. We have responded by offering additional products targeted to each price and quality segment of the market, more aggressively price and feature enrich our products and enter new segments, such as cell phones, with different competitive pressure. While we present a value proposition that stresses the cost reducing capabilities of our audio solutions through improved performance from lower cost components as well as product differentiation that Spatializer technology can deliver, all such features are closely scrutinized by potential customers product marketing and engineering. This makes it more challenging to secure new design wins, particularly in product categories that have become commoditized, such as the case with DVD players. It also may result in the elimination of features, including ours, if cost is of paramount importance. There is no assurance that our present or contemplated future products will achieve or maintain sufficient commercial acceptance, or if they do, that functionally equivalent products will not be developed by current or future competitors who had access to significantly greater resources or which are willing to give away their products.  Because Our Relative Size and Power Is Small Compared To That of Our Customers, Our Business Leverage With Some Customers Is Generally Weak and Communication Not Always Transparent          We deal with some of the largest global consumer electronics makers in the world, the vast majority of which are in Asia. Spatializer is a small company and there are other options for manufacturers, including those from our competitors, their chip suppliers, or eliminating the use of audio enhancement technology altogether. As such, our leverage with our customers is generally weak. In addition, the culture in our local markets may not dictate clear, direct and transparent communication of business plans or technology usage as is the culture in our home country. When this occurs, we could receive very short notice of discontinued use of our technology and revenues from such an account would typically begin a steep decline in the subsequent quarter, resulting in period-to-period fluctuation. This also results in limited visibility with regard to future revenues and its impact on our operating results. Our response has been to strengthen our business relationships with more onsite visits, increase our understanding of cultural differences and focus more intently on service. We also emphasize to our overseas sales representatives the need for close customer support, with the objective that both new opportunities and possible difficulties are brought to light as soon as possible.  We Rely on the Schedules and Cooperation of Chip Makers or Other Third Parties to Deliver Our Technology in Consumer Products. These Third Parties Have Their Own Priorities and Alliances That May Delay or Thwart our Sales Efforts to Potential Customers.    Spatializer does not develop or market semiconductors. That is why we carry no inventory or have order backlogs that typically are good indicators of near term performance. Rather, we develop audio algorithms that are embedded on third party processors or semiconductors used by our customers. While our algorithms are implemented on a wide array of processors, often times a customer uses a processor where there is no such implementation, or where a competing solution has been implemented. In this case, our customers request that our algorithm be implemented. While these requests are typically honored, processor manufacturers must schedule such implementation as their resources or corporate strategies allow. Therefore, the supply-chain is often quite long and complicated, which potentially can result in delays or deadlines that may not always coincide with our customers requirements and which are beyond the control of our company .  In addition, standards may be adopted by cell phone system operators or manufacturers that may impede or prevent the penetration of non-standard technology onto their platforms. While our efforts are focused on promoting our technology to such potential customers, there is no assurance that we will be successful in making our technology a standard.   If New Product Development Is Delayed, We Will Experience Delays In Revenues And Competitive Products May Reach The Market Before Our Products.          Since our inception, we have experienced delays in bringing new products to market and commercial application as a result of delays inherent in technology development, financial resource limits and industry responses and maturity. These delays have resulted in delays in the timing of revenues and product introduction. In the future, delays in new product development or technology introduction on behalf of us, our original equipment manufacturers of consumer electronics and multimedia computer products (OEMs), integrated circuit (IC) foundries or our software producers and marketers could result in further delays in revenues and could allow competitors to reach the market with products before us. In view of the emerging nature of the technology involved, and the rapidly changing character of the entire media, internet and computer markets, our expansion into other technology areas and the   23       uncertainties concerning the ability of our current products and new products to achieve meaningful commercial acceptance, there can be no assurance of when or if we will achieve or sustain profitability.         Manufacturers design-in cycles for our technology range from four to twelve months, from the decision to adopt our technology to cashflow. These schedules are also prone to delays at the manufacturer level and in some cases, manufacturers new products may be cancelled due to market testing or resource allocation. Since these events are beyond our control, it is difficult to absolutely project when new deals will begin generating revenues or if signed deals will generate financial results. For this reason, we do not typically announce new deals until the target product is being introduced.         We Expect That We Will Continue to be Dependent upon a Limited Number of OEMs for a Significant Portion of Our Net Sales in Future Periods         Although no OEM is presently obligated either to purchase a specified amount of products or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases for any period, we anticipate being dependent upon a limited number of OEMs for a large port of our net sales. Our four largest customers as of December 31, 2004 accounted for 30%, 25%, 21% and 13% of our net sales.. The loss of any one of our major customers or licensees would significantly reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or sustain acceptable levels of operating results. The loss, or signing of a similarly sized account or accounts would have a material short term impact on our operations and there is no assurance that we will not lose all or some of the revenues from one or more of these accounts. While we are working to broaden the sources of our royalty streams, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining or attracting such key accounts and broadening such revenue stream sources.         Demand for Our Products is Subject to Risks Beyond Our Control.         Our products are typically one of many related products used by consumer electronic users. As a result, demand for our products is therefore subject to many risks beyond our control, including, among others:                    competition faced by our OEM customers in their particular end markets;                         the technical, sales and marketing and management capabilities of our OEM customers;                         the pressure faced by our OEM customers to reduce cost            There can be no assurance that we will not lose sales in the future as a result of the pressure to reduce costs faced by our customers. The reduction of orders from our significant OEM customers, or the discontinuance of our products by our end users may subject us to potential adverse revenue fluctuations.  Because The Technology Environment In Which We Operate Is Rapidly Changing, We May Not Be Successful In Establishing And Maintaining The Technological Superiority Of Our Products Over Those Of Our Competitors.          We operate in a technology environment which is competitive and rapidly changing. While our software applications deliver what we, and most manufacturers who listen to it, believe is a significantly superior audio experience, the competitive market forces that pressure manufacturers to reduce their costs may create some resistance to new technology adoption or use. Our future success is dependent on establishing and maintaining the technological superiority of our products over those of competitors, our ability to successfully identify and bring other compatible technologies and products to market and a recognition by the market of product value. We compete with a number of entities that produce various stereo audio enhancement processes, technologies and products in both traditional two-speaker environments such as consumer electronics and multimedia computing, and in multi-channel, multi-speaker applications such as Home Theater. In the field of 3-D or virtual audio, our principal competitors are SRS Labs, Inc., QSound Labs, Inc. and Dolby Laboratories or technologies and products developed by other companies, including entities that have business relationships with us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to favorably compete in this market in the future.  If We Are Unable To Attract And Retain Our Key Personnel, We May Not Be Able To Successfully Operate Our Business.          Our future success primarily depends on the abilities and efforts of a small number of individuals, with particular management obligations and technical expertise. Loss of the services of any of these persons could adversely affect our business prospects. There is no assurance that we will be able to retain this group or successfully recruit other personnel, as needed. We compete with other   24       enterprises with stronger financial resources and larger staffs that may offer employment opportunities to our staff which are more desirable than those which we are able to offer. Failure to maintain skilled personnel with the software and engineering skills critical to our business could have an adverse impact upon our business, the results of our operations and our prospects. Currently, all new licenses are negotiated by Henry R. Mandell, our Chief Executive Officer, with whom we have an employment agreement with a term expiring in November 2006.   The Market For Our Stock May Be Not Remain Liquid And The Stock Price May Be Subject To Volatility          Our stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, where low trading volume and high volatility is often experienced. While a few firms make a market in our stock, the historically low trading volume and relatively few market makers of our stock makes it more likely that a severe fluctuation in volume, either up or down, will significantly impact the stock price. There can be no assurance that these market makers will continue to quote our stock and a reduction in such market makers would negatively impact trading liquidity. Further, with our constrained resources and increased cost and time associated with implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley, it may not be possible for us to remain listed on the OTC Bulletin Board in the future as a fully reporting company. This and the existing limited market and volume in the trading of our stock, may result in our shareholders having difficulty selling our common stock.The trading price of our Common Stock has been, and will likely continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our operating results, announcements of new products or technological innovations by the Company or our competitors, strategic alliances between us and third parties, general market fluctuations and other events and factors, some of which may be beyond our control.      Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    We have not been exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on our short-term investments at December 31, 2004. A hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in interest rate (ten percent of our overall earnings rate) would not result in a material fluctuation in future earnings or cash flow. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or for speculative purposes and we are not currently evaluating the future use of such financial instruments.    25              Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
