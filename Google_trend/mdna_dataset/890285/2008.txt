ITEM 7.           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION                   AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  This discussion presents our management's  analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,  respectively.  The discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes related thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We have restated  certain amounts in our  consolidated  statements of income for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, as a result of comments from the  SEC,  as  discussed  in  Note 1 to our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In addition  to the  aforementioned  restatement  certain  reclassifications  of amounts  previously  reported  have been made to the  accompanying  Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability  between periods presented.  Recent Developments  On  November  7, 2007,  we entered  into an  agreement  and plan of merger  with National  and  vFin  Acquisition  Corporation,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of National.  Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement,  vFin  Acquisition  Corporation  will be merged with and into us, the separate corporate existence of vFin Acquisition  Corporation will cease, and we will  continue as a surviving  corporation  of the merger and as a  wholly-owned subsidiary of National.  For additional  information regarding this transaction, see "Item 1. Business - Recent Developments."  Overview  We  are  a  financial   services   company  that   specializes  in  high  growth opportunities.  Our three  principal  lines of business  are: (1) offering  full service   retail   brokerage  to   approximately   12,000  high  net  worth  and institutional clients, (2) providing investment banking, merger, acquisition and advisory  services to micro,  small and mid-cap high growth  companies,  and (3) trading  securities,  including making markets in over 3,500 micro and small cap stocks and providing  liquidity in the United States  Treasury  marketplace.  In addition to our core  business,  we offer  information  services on our website. vFinance  Investments,  Inc.  ("vFinance  Investments") and EquityStation,  Inc. ("EquityStation"),  two of our subsidiaries,  are broker-dealers registered with the Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC"),  and members of the Financial Industry Regulatory  Authority  ("FINRA") (formerly the National  Association of Securities  Dealers) and Securities Investor  Protection  Corporation  ("SIPC"). vFinance  Investments  is also a  member  of the  National  Futures  Association ("NFA").  In May 2006, we completed the acquisition of select assets of Sterling Financial Group (the  "Sterling  Financial  Acquisition"),  following the  acquisition  of certain assets of Global Partners  Securities,  Inc.  ("Global") and 100% of the issued and outstanding  equity securities of EquityStation in November 2004 (the "Global Acquisition").  These acquisitions are reflected in vFinance's financial statements from their respective  transaction dates, affecting the comparability of its results of  operations  in the years ended  December 31,  2007,  2006 and 2005, as discussed in the sections that follow.  See Note 4,  "Acquisitions," to our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further  information about the Sterling  Financial  Acquisition and the Global Acquisition.                                        -34-     The largest  portion of our revenues,  63%, 62% and 72% in 2007,  2006 and 2005, respectively,  was  attributable  to  retail  brokerage  commissions  and  other brokerage-related   income   generated   by  our  wholly   owned   broker-dealer subsidiaries,  vFinance  Investments  and  EquityStation.  Our retail  brokerage operations  buy and sell  securities  for our customers from other dealers on an agency  basis,  and charge our  customers a commission  for our  services.  Such commission  revenue  is  derived  from  brokerage  transactions  in  listed  and over-the-counter  securities and mutual fund securities.  We also generated 25%, 25% and 16% of our  revenues  through  trading  profits  generated in our market making  activities  in 2007,  2006 and 2005,  respectively.  The majority of our remaining revenues are derived primarily from investment banking-related success and consulting fees.  We reported a net loss of $1.7  million  ($0.03 per basic and diluted  share) in 2007,  compared to $2.2 million ($0.04 per basic and diluted share) in 2006. Our revenues increased $12.0 million in 2007, or 31%, principally as a result of the addition of new brokers from the Sterling Financial Acquisition and the addition of independent brokers in 2007 and 2006. Increases in compensation,  commissions and benefit expenses, clearing and transaction costs and occupancy and equipment costs related to the increased revenues and the Sterling  Financial  Acquisition also increased.  Our  depreciation  and  amortization  expense also increased by $325.5 thousand in 2007,  primarily as a result of amortization expense recorded in connection with the Sterling Financial Acquisition.  We reported a net loss of $2.2  million  ($0.04 per basic and diluted  share) in 2006,  compared to $1.1 million ($0.03 per basic and diluted share) in 2005. Our revenues increased $12.6 million in 2006, or 49%, principally as a result of the Sterling Financial Acquisition and improved market conditions for its investment banking and trading  businesses.  Increases  in  compensation,  commissions  and benefit  expenses,  clearing and  transaction  costs and occupancy and equipment costs related to the increased revenues and the Sterling  Financial  Acquisition partially  offset these  increased  revenues.  Additionally,  we recorded $448.2 thousand of stock-based  compensation expense in 2006 compared to $19.4 thousand in 2005, as a result of the implementation of Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),  "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R").  Our depreciation and amortization expense also increased by $512.4 thousand in 2006, primarily as a result of  amortization  expense  recorded in connection with the Sterling Financial Acquisition.                                        -35-    Results of Operations  The following  table and discussion  summarizes the changes in the major revenue and expense  categories for the past three years, with 2006 and 2005 having been restated:                                                                 As of and for the Years Ended December 31,                                          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                              2007       2006        Change         %       2005       Change         %                                                      (Restated)                 Change   (Restated)               Change                                          ----------- -----------  -----------  -------- ----------- -----------  ---------   Revenues:                   Commissions -

Additionally,  success  fees from  investment  banking  increased  27%,  or $1.2 million,  primarily  as a result of an increase in  investment  banking  revenue during the fourth  quarter,  when we  completed a  substantial  capital  raising transaction.  In 2006, total revenues  increased $12.6 million,  or 49%, primarily as a result of the Sterling  Financial  Acquisition  and more favorable  market  conditions. Approximately  43% of the $12.6 million  increase is  attributable  to increased trading profits,  derived from the customer relationships acquired from Sterling Financial in May 2006 and generally  more  favorable  trading  conditions in our market  making  activities.  An  additional  35% of the  2006  revenue  increase resulted from higher  agency  commissions,  attributable  to the addition of new brokers, through both the Sterling Financial Acquisition and other brokers hired independently. The majority of the remaining increase was due to higher revenues from  success  fees  relating  to  investment  banking  transactions,  resulting primarily  from more  favorable  market  conditions in 2006.  Non-cash  revenues derived from success fees increased to $2.0 million in 2006 from $487.5 thousand in 2005.

Compensation, commissions and benefits increased $10.5 million, or 34%, in 2007. Compensation,  commissions  and  benefits  are  correlated  with  our  revenues, primarily agency  commissions,  trading profits and success fees from investment banking,  which increased by 28% in the aggregate in 2007.  Additional increases in  compensation,   commissions  and  benefits  are  primarily  attributable  to incentive compensation provided to new brokers.  Compensation, commissions and benefits increased $10.9 million, or 54%, in 2006, primarily  as a result of  increased  agency  commissions,  trading  profits and success fees from investment banking, which increased by 55% in the aggregate in 2006. We also recorded  $448.2  thousand of  compensation  expense in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, effective January 1, 2006, compared to $19.4 thousand recorded in 2005. Additional increases in compensation, commissions and benefits  are  attributable  to increased  benefit  costs,  particularly  health insurance premiums. Non-cash compensation paid increased to $1.4 million in 2006 from $158.1 thousand in 2005.  Clearing and transaction costs.  Clearing  and  transaction  costs  increased  $87.9  thousand  in  2007,  or 2%, primarily  as a result of an  increase in  transaction  volume  attributable  to customer  relationships  acquired in the Sterling Financial  Acquisition and the addition of other independent brokers,  largely offset by a shift in our revenue mix to lower-cost institutional trading transactions.  Clearing and transaction costs increased $1.4 million in 2006, or 46%, primarily as a result of an  increase  in  transaction  volume  attributable  to  customer relationships acquired in the Sterling Financial Acquisition and the addition of other independent brokers.  General and administrative costs.  General and  administrative  expenses increased $834.0 thousand in 2007, or 26%, primarily  as a  result  of legal  fees and  settlement  costs  associated  with arbitration   and   litigation   matters  in  2007  and  the  expansion  of  our Sarbanes-Oxley and Gramm-Leach-Bliley  compliance programs.  Remaining increases resulted from temporary labor and other increased  professional  fees to support our growth.  General and  administrative  expenses increased $826.0 thousand in 2006, or 35%, primarily as a result of (i) a $303.0 thousand increase in legal fees, primarily associated  with  litigation and  arbitration  matters,  (ii) $261.3 thousand of non-cash  costs  associated  with the  issuance  of  equity in  connection  with arbitration  settlements,  and (iii) the forgiveness of $215.0 thousand due from an unconsolidated affiliate.  Occupancy and equipment costs.  Occupancy  and equipment  expenses  decreased  $113.3  thousand in 2007, or 10%, primarily  because in December 2006 we subleased  office space  acquired under a lease assumed in connection with the Sterling Financial Acquisition.   Occupancy  and equipment  expenses  increased  $423.3  thousand in 2006, or 57%, primarily as a result of the occupancy and equipment  costs  associated with the Sterling Financial Acquisition.   Depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation  and  amortization  increased  $325.5  thousand  in  2007,  or 34%, primarily as a result of the amortization  expense  associated with the customer relationships  from the Sterling  Acquisition  depreciation  expense  related to property and equipment  additions,  including  computer  equipment under capital leases.                                        -38-    Depreciation  and  amortization  increased  $512.4  thousand  in 2006,  or 115%, primarily as a result of the amortization  expense  associated with the customer relationships from the Sterling Acquisition.  Goodwill impairment.  In 2005, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $420.0 thousand to write-off goodwill from a prior period acquisition, when certain brokers left the firm and we determined there was no longer value remaining in the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition. We had no goodwill remaining at December 31, 2007 or 2006.  Income Tax Provision (Benefit)  We account for income taxes in  accordance  with the  provision of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting  for Income Taxes," which  requires the  recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when these balances reverse.   Future  tax  benefits   attributable  to  temporary  differences  are recognized  to the extent that the  realization  of such benefits is more likely than not. We have  concluded  that it is more likely than not that our  deferred tax assets as of December  31,  2007 and 2006 will not be realized  based on the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected taxable income.  The amount of the deferred tax assets actually realized,  however,  could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income. Should we determine  that we will be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future,  an  adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be recorded in the period such determination is made.  We did not record a provision for income taxes in 2007, 2006 or 2005 as a result of the net loss we recorded in those periods.  In  July  2006,  the  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued Interpretation  No.  48,  "Accounting  for  Uncertainty  in  Income  Taxes  - an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109" ("FIN 48"). This Interpretation prescribes a consistent  recognition threshold and measurement standard, as well as a clear criteria for subsequently recognizing, derecognizing and measuring tax positions for financial  statement  purposes.  The  Interpretation  also requires expanded disclosure  with  respect  to   uncertainties  as  they  relate  to  income  tax accounting.  FIN 48 was effective for fiscal years  beginning after December 15, 2006.  Management has evaluated all of its tax positions and determined that FIN 48 did not have a  material  impact on our  financial  position  or  results  of operations.   Transactions with Affiliates  During 2006, we recorded a $215.0 thousand charge to write-off  amounts due from an unconsolidated  subsidiary,  Center for Innovative  Entrepreneurship ("CIE"), for expenses we incurred on its behalf.  We provide  office space and management and administrative services to CIE through an agreement under which we should be reimbursed the costs of providing  these  services.  We accrued a receivable for reimbursements  totaling  $215.0  thousand  through  December 31, 2006 under the expectation  that CIE would  generate  cash flows  sufficient  to  provide  cash reimbursement.  While preparing our Consolidated  Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006, we determined that recovery of this $215.0 thousand was  unlikely,  and that  reimbursements  for these costs in the future would  be  uncertain  until  CIE   demonstrates  an  ability  to  reimburse  us. Accordingly,  we wrote-off the entire receivable balance and currently recognize amounts reimbursed by CIE under the cost recovery method. We expect to terminate this arrangement in 2008.                                        -39-    Also during  2006,  we paid $161.9  thousand  for a 4.9% equity  interest in The Cluster Competitiveness Group, S.A, a company that provides economic feasibility services.  We  made  this  investment  because  we  believed  that  through  its relationship, we could benefit from the introduction to investment banking needs of the clients of this  affiliate,  and may make further  investments  in future periods, although we have no commitment to do so.  On January 1, 2003, we entered into an agreement with JSM Capital  Holding Corp. ("JSM"), a retail brokerage  operation  headquartered in New York and founded by John S.  Matthews  (who also was, at the same time,  named the  President of our Retail  Brokerage  Division).  We issued JSM  warrants to  purchase  1.0 million shares of our common  stock at an exercise  price of $0.20 in exchange for a 19% equity  interest  in JSM.  The  warrants  were  valued  using the  Black-Scholes valuation method, which calculated the value to be $0.08 per warrant, or $80,000 in the aggregate. In August 2005, our relationship with JSM was terminated,  and we fully impaired the  investment in JSM in the fourth quarter of 2005,  when it was determined  that JSM had no remaining  material  assets or  operations.  Mr. Matthews  filed  an  arbitration  action  against  us  in  connection  with  the termination of the relationship, which was settled in July 2007. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement  agreement,  we paid $75.0  thousand to Mr.  Matthews in 2007 and are obligated to make further payments  totaling $225.0 thousand to Mr. Matthews.  See Note 13 to our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  further discussion of the arbitration action and subsequent settlement.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Historically,  we have  satisfied  our liquidity  and  regulatory  capital needs through the  issuance of equity and debt  securities.  As of December  31, 2007, liquid assets  consisted  primarily of cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million and marketable securities of $817.4 thousand, for a total of $6.3 million, which represents a $1.1 million  increase over the $5.2 million in liquid assets as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2007, vFinance had long-term capital lease obligations of $297.5 thousand, net of current obligations of $247.0 thousand.  Both vFinance  Investments and  EquityStation are subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital  Rule (rule  15c3-1),  which  requires  the  maintenance  of minimum net capital and  requires  that the ratio of aggregate  indebtedness  to net capital shall  not  exceed  15 to 1 (and  the  rule of the  "applicable"  exchange  also provides that equity  capital may not be withdrawn or cash dividends paid if the resulting  net  capital  ratio  would  exceed 10 to 1). At  December  31,  2007, vFinance Investments had net capital of $1.48 million, which was $481.7 thousand in excess of its required  net capital of $1.0  million.  EquityStation  had net capital of $543.4  thousand  that was $443.4  thousand in excess of its required net capital of $100.0 thousand.  vFinance  Investments'  percentage of aggregate  indebtedness to net capital was 289.6% in 2007.  EquityStation's  percentage  of aggregate  indebtedness  to net capital was 35.8% in 2007. vFinance Investments and EquityStation  qualify under the exemptive provisions of rule 15c3-3 under Section (k)(2)(ii) of the rule, as they do not carry security accounts of customers or perform custodial  functions related to customer securities.                                        -40-    For the periods  ended  December  31, 2007 and 2006,  we had gross  deferred tax assets of $5.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively, which were offset by 100% valuation  allowances.  The valuation  allowances were recorded  against certain deferred tax assets that were generated from net operating losses. In evaluating whether we would  recover  these  deferred  tax assets,  we have not assumed any future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carry-forwards. Based on our history of generating  operating  losses,  management  believes the ability to realize the benefit of net operating  loss  carry-forwards  to offset future taxable income is uncertain. However, future income generation and/or the use of tax planning  strategies to recover these  deferred tax assets could lead to the reversal of the valuation allowances and a reduction in future income tax expense.  We  believe  that  our  estimates  for  the  valuation  allowance  are appropriate, based on current facts and circumstances.  Cash  and cash  equivalents  increased  (decreased)  by $1.2  million,  $(222.2) thousand and $(828.9)  thousand  during 2007, 2006 and 2005,  respectively.  The major components of these changes are discussed below.  Cash  provided  by (used  in)  operating  activities  was $1.6  million  in 2007 compared to $370.9 thousand in 2006 and $(673.3) thousand in 2005. Cash provided by (used in)  operating  activities  includes  net income  adjusted for non-cash items and the  effects  of  changes  in  working  capital  including  changes in marketable  securities.  Cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.3 million in 2007,  primarily  as a result of the decrease in our net loss in 2007 and an increase  in our accrued  liabilities,  consisting  primarily  of accrued compensation paid during the first quarter of 2008.  Cash provided by operating  activities  was $370.9  thousand in 2006 compared to cash used in operating  activities  of $673.3  thousand in 2005,  primarily as a result of a $405.2  thousand  decrease in amounts due from clearing  brokers,  a $285.0 thousand  decrease in accounts  receivable and a $716.0 thousand increase in accrued  compensation paid during the first quarter of 2007, partially offset by a $428.0 increase in marketable securities.  Cash used in investing activities in 2007 was $106.9 thousand compared to $384.6 thousand in 2006 and $125.7 thousand in 2005. Cash used in investing  activities consisted  of  capital  expenditures  of  $106.9,  $222.7  thousand,  and $125.7 thousand in 2007, 2006 and 2005,  respectively,  excluding non-cash additions to property and equipment through capital leases. Cash used in investing activities in  2006  also  included  a  $161.9  thousand  investment  in an  unconsolidated affiliate.  Cash used in financing activities in 2007 was $281.1 thousand compared to $208.5 thousand in 2006 and $29.9 thousand in 2005.  Cash used in financing  activities was comprised of repayments of capital lease obligations  related to new capital lease agreements for computer equipment, which we entered into during 2007, 2006 and 2005.  We believe cash on hand is sufficient to meet our working  capital  requirements over the next twelve  months.  However,  we may seek  additional  debt or equity financing in order to carry out our long-term  business  strategy.  Such funding may be a result of bank  borrowings,  public  offerings,  private  placements of equity or debt securities,  or a combination  thereof. We cannot be certain that additional  debt or equity  financing  will be  available  when  required or, if available, that we can secure it on terms satisfactory to us.                                        -41-    Contractual Obligations  The following table summarizes our future contractual commitments as of December 31,  2007,  consisting  of debt  payments  related to capital  leases and future minimum lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year.     (In thousands)                      Total          2008        2009 - 2010   2011 - 2012     Therafter                                  -------------  -------------  ------------  -------------  --------------             Capital lease obligations           $   544.5      $   247.0      $  297.5      $       -         $     - Operating lease obligations           4,628.5        1,358.5       1,348.3        1,295.0           626.7                                  -------------  -------------  ------------  -------------  --------------  Total                               $ 5,173.0      $ 1,605.5      $1,645.8      $ 1,295.0         $ 626.7                                  =============  =============  ============  =============  ==============     Off Balance-Sheet Arrangements  We were not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements during the three years ended December 31, 2007. In particular, we do not have any interest in so-called limited purpose entities, which include special purpose entities and structured finance entities.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  which have been  prepared in accordance with United States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  The preparation  of these  financial  statements  requires  our  management  to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,  and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We evaluate  our  estimates on an ongoing  basis,  and we base our estimates  on  historical  experience  and  various  other  assumptions  we deem reasonable to the situation.  These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making  judgments about the carrying  values of assets and liabilities  that are not  readily  apparent  from  other  sources.  Changes  in our  estimates  could materially  impact our results of  operations  and  financial  condition  in any particular period.  Note 1 to our Consolidated  Financial  Statements includes a summary  of  the  significant  accounting  policies  and  methods  used  in  the preparation of our Consolidated  Financial Statements.  Based on the high degree of  judgment or  complexity  in their  application,  we  consider  our  critical accounting policies and estimates to be:  REVENUE RECOGNITION.  We periodically receive equity instruments,  which include stock purchase warrants and common and preferred stock from companies as part of compensation  for  investment-banking   services.   Primarily  all  such  equity instruments  are  received  from  small  public   companies  and  are  typically restricted  as to resale,  generally  receiving  registration  rights within one year. When we receive equity  instruments as compensation for investment banking services, revenue is recognized based on the fair value of these instruments, in accordance with EITF 00-8  "Accounting by a Grantee for an Equity  Instrument to be received in  Conjunction  with  Providing  Goods or  Services."  We recognize revenue for these  stock  purchase  warrants  when  received  based on the Black Scholes  valuation  model.  The  revenue  recognized  related  to  other  equity instruments is determined based on available market information, discounted by a factor  reflective of the expected  holding period for those  particular  equity instruments. The actual amount of cash proceeds realized from the disposition of these securities may differ materially from the amount of revenue recorded, as a result of changes in market values  between the date of receipt and the date the security is sold.                                        -42-    CUSTOMER CLAIMS.  In the normal course of business,  our operating  subsidiaries have  been  and  continue  to be the  subject  of  numerous  civil  actions  and arbitrations  arising out of customer  complaints  relating to  activities  as a broker-dealer,  as an employer and as a result of other business activities.  In general,  the cases involve various  allegations  that our employees  mishandled customer  accounts.  Based on our historical  experience and  consultation  with counsel,  we typically  reserve an amount we believe will be sufficient to cover any damages  assessed  against us.  However,  we have in the past been  assessed damages that exceeded our  reserves.  If we misjudged the amount of damages that may be assessed against us from pending or threatened claims or if we are unable to  adequately  estimate the amount of damages that will be assessed  against us from  claims  that arise in the future and reserve  accordingly,  our  operating income would be reduced.  FAIR VALUE.  "Securities  owned" and "Securities sold, not yet purchased" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets are carried at market value, with related unrealized gains and losses recognized in our results of operations.  vFinance  Investments relies upon its clearing firms to provide it with these market  values,  because the  clearing  firms use market data  services  that  provide  market  values of securities based on current market prices.  New Accounting Pronouncements  See Notes 1 and 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  We have exposure to market risk, and periodically hedge against that risk. We do not hold or issue any  derivative  financial  instruments  for  trading or other speculative  purposes.  We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair market value of the marketable securities that we hold. Our revenue and profitability may be adversely  affected by declines in the volume of securities transactions and in market  liquidity,  which generally result in lower revenues from trading activities and commissions.  Lower securities price levels may also result in a reduced volume of  transactions,  as well as losses from declines in the market  value of  securities  we hold in trading and  investment  positions. Sudden sharp  declines in market values of securities and the failure of issuers and counterparts to perform their  obligations can result in illiquid markets in which we may incur losses in its principal trading activities.                                         -43-    ITEM 8.
