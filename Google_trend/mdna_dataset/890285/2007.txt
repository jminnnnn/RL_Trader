ITEM 7.           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION                   AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.       You  should  read the  following  discussion  in  conjunction  with Part I, including matters set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of this Form 10-K, and our Consolidated  Financial  Statements and notes thereto included  elsewhere in this Form 10-K.       We  have  restated  and  revised  certain  amounts  in our  2005  and  2004 Consolidated  Financial  Statements as a result of comments we received from the staff  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.  As  a  result  of  these restatements and revisions, our total revenues and income (loss) from operations increased  (decreased)  from previously  reported amounts by $244.4 thousand and $(137.7)  thousand,  respectively,  in 2005  and  $170.7  thousand  and  $(17.6) thousand,  respectively, in 2004. Additionally,  our net income (loss) increased (decreased)  from  previously  reported  amounts by $137.7  thousand  ($0.01 per share) and $(128.0)  thousand ($0.01 per share) in 2005 and 2004,  respectively. See Note 1 to our Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual  Report on Form 10-K for  additional  discussion of the  restatement  and revision.       In  addition  to  the  aforementioned  restatement  and  revision,  certain reclassifications   of  amounts  previously  reported  have  been  made  to  the accompanying  Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented.       Overview       We are a global financial services company which specializes in high growth opportunities.  Our insight  into this  marketplace  flows from three  principal lines of business:  providing investment banking and advisory services to micro, small and mid-cap high growth companies;  making markets in over 3,000 micro and small cap stocks;  and offering  information  services on our website, a leading destination  for  emerging  companies  seeking  capital  and  investors  seeking opportunities.  Due to our focus, we believe we are uniquely positioned to offer alternative investments to institutional and high net-worth investors seeking to outperform  market  indices in addition  to offering a full range of  investment options. With over 40 offices in the U.S. and other parts of the world, we serve more than 12,000 corporate,  institutional and high net worth clients.  vFinance Investments,  Inc.  ("vFinance  Investments,  Inc.")  and  EquityStation,   Inc. ("EquityStation"), both our subsidiaries, are broker-dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"),  and members of National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD") and Securities  Investor  Protection  Corporation ("SIPC").  vFinance  Investments  is  also  a  member  of the  National  Futures Association ("NFA").       In May 2006,  we completed  the  acquisition  of select  assets of Sterling Financial   Group  (the  "Sterling   Financial   Acquisition"),   following  the acquisition of certain assets of Global Partners Securities, Inc. ("Global") and 100% of the  issued  and  outstanding  equity  securities  of  EquityStation  in November 2004 (the "Global  Acquisition").  These  acquisitions are reflected in our financial statements from their respective  transaction dates, affecting the comparability of our results of operations in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005  and  2004,  as  discussed  in  the  sections  that  follow.  See  Note  4, "Acquisitions,"  to our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in Item 8 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further  information  about the Sterling Financial and Global Acquisitions.                                        -31-         The largest  portion of our  revenues,  62%, 72% and 65% in 2006,  2005 and 2004,  respectively,  was attributable to retail brokerage commissions and other brokerage-related   income   generated   by  our  wholly   owned   broker-dealer subsidiaries,  vFinance  Investments  and  EquityStation.  Our retail  brokerage operations  buy and sell  securities  for our customers from other dealers on an agency  basis,  and charge our  customers a commission  for our  services.  Such commission  revenue  is  derived  from  brokerage  transactions  in  listed  and over-the-counter  securities and mutual fund securities.  We also generated 25%, 16% and 19% of our  revenues  through  trading  profits  generated in our market making  activities  in 2006,  2005 and 2004,  respectively.  The majority of our remaining revenues are derived primarily from investment banking-related success and consulting fees.       We reported a net loss of $2.1 million  ($0.04 per basic and diluted share) in 2006,  compared to $1.0 million  ($0.02 per basic and diluted share) in 2005. Our revenues increased $12.5 million in 2006, or 48%, principally as a result of the Sterling  Financial  Acquisition  and  improved  market  conditions  for our investment   banking  and  trading   businesses.   Increases  in   compensation, commissions and benefit  expenses,  clearing and transaction costs and occupancy and equipment costs related to the increased revenues and the Sterling Financial Acquisition offset these increased  revenues.  Additionally,  we recorded $448.2 thousand of stock-based  compensation expense in 2006 compared to $19.4 thousand in 2005, as a result of the implementation of Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),  "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R").  Our depreciation and amortization expense also increased by $512.4 thousand in 2006, primarily as a result of  amortization  expense  recorded in connection with the Sterling Financial Acquisition.       We reported a net loss of $1.0 million  ($0.02 per basic and diluted share) in 2005,  compared  to net income of $2.4  million  ($0.07 per basic and diluted share) in 2004.  During 2005, our revenues  decreased  $429.3  thousand,  or 2%, primarily as a result of less  favorable  market  conditions  for the investment banking and trading  businesses  in 2005 than in 2004,  while our  clearing  and transaction costs increased $737.9 thousand in 2005,  principally as a result of the addition of the  EquityStation  platform business and increases in execution fees for wholesale  trading.  Additionally,  our  depreciation  and amortization expense  increased $280.2 thousand in 2005,  primarily as a result of the Global Acquisition,  and we recorded a goodwill  impairment  charge of $420.0 thousand. During  2004,  we  recorded  a $1.5  million  gain on  forgiveness  of debt,  in connection with the termination of a credit agreement.                                        -32-    Results of Operations       The  following  table and  discussion  summarizes  the changes in the major revenue  and expense  categories  for the past three  years,  with 2005 and 2004 having been restated:                                                                      As of and for the Years Ended December 31,                                          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             2006         2005         Change      % Change      2004         Change      % Change                                          ------------ ------------  -----------  ----------------------- ------------- ------------  Revenues:                    Commissions -

Approximately  43% of the $12.5 million increase is attributable to increased trading profits, derived from the customer relationships acquired from Sterling  Financial in May 2006 and generally more favorable trading  conditions in our market making activities.  An additional 35% of the 2006 revenue increase resulted from higher  agency  commissions,  attributable  to the addition of new brokers, through both the Sterling Financial Acquisition and other brokers hired independently. The majority of the remaining increase was due to higher revenues from  success  fees  relating  to  investment  banking  transactions,  resulting primarily  from more  favorable  market  conditions in 2006.  Non-cash  revenues derived from success fees increased to $2.0 million in 2006 from $487.5 thousand in 2005.       Total revenues decreased 2% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily as a result of 19% and 34%  decreases  in trading  profits and success  fees,  respectively, resulting  from less  favorable  market  conditions in 2005 than in 2004 for the trading and investment banking businesses,  respectively.  Partially  offsetting these factors, was a 9% increase in retail agency commissions, attributable to a $1.6 million  increase in revenues from the customer  relationships  recorded in the Global  Acquisition,  derived from having a full year of operations in 2005, compared to two months in 2004.                                          -34-    Operating Expenses                                                                As of and for the Years Ended December 31,                                          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          2005                                     2004                                                        (Restated                    %          (Restated                    %                                               2006    and Revised)     Change    Change      and Revised)     Change      Change                                          ------------ -----------  ------------ --------- ----------------- -----------  --------                  Compensation, commissions and benefits   $ 31,232.0  $ 20,313.3    $ 10,918.7      54 %        $ 19,791.0     $ 522.3       3 %  Clearing and transaction costs              4,337.2     2,977.2       1,360.0      46 %           2,239.3       737.9      33 %  General and administrative costs            3,158.8     2,332.8         826.0      35 %           2,310.2        22.6       1 %  Occupancy and equipment costs               1,166.6       743.3         423.3      57 %             475.6       267.7      56 %  Depreciation and amortization                 958.7       446.3         512.4     115 %             166.1       280.2     169 %  Goodwill impairment                               -       420.0        (420.0)   (100)%                 -       420.0      nm                                          ------------ -----------  ------------ --------- ----------------- -----------  --------         Total operating costs             $ 40,853.3  $ 27,232.9    $ 13,620.4      50 %        $ 24,982.2   $ 2,250.7       9 %                                          ============ ===========  ============ ========= ================= ===========  ========    nm - not meaningful        Compensation, commissions and benefits.       Compensation,  commissions and benefits increased $10.9 million, or 54%, in 2006.  Compensation,  commissions  and  benefits  are  correlated  with  to  our revenues,  which  increased  48% in 2006,  primarily as a result of the Sterling Financial Acquisition.  We also recorded $448.2 thousand of compensation expense in  connection  with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R,  effective  January 1, 2006. Additional increases in compensation,  commissions and benefits are attributable to increased benefit costs,  particularly  health insurance  premiums.  Non-cash compensation  paid  increased  to $1.4  million in 2006 from $158.1  thousand in 2005.       Compensation, commissions and benefits increased $522.3 thousand, or 3%, in 2005,  primarily  as a result of  increased  personnel  to  support  our  growth resulting, in part, from the Global Acquisition, including the addition of a new senior management positions and new staff positions.       Clearing and transaction costs.       Clearing and  transaction  costs  increased  $1.4 million in 2006,  or 46%, primarily  as a result of an  increase in  transaction  volume  attributable  to customer  relationships  acquired in the Sterling Financial  Acquisition and the addition of other independent brokers.       Clearing and transaction  costs increased  $737.9 thousand in 2005, or 33%, primarily  as a result of the  addition of the  EquityStation  trading  platform business and  increases in execution  fees for wholesale  trading,  resulting in higher average transaction costs associated with trading activities.       General and administrative costs.       General and  administrative  expenses increased $826.0 thousand in 2006, or 35%,  primarily  as a result of (i) a $303.0  thousand  increase  in legal fees, primarily  associated  with  litigation  and  arbitration  matters,  (ii) $261.3 thousand of non-cash costs  associated with the issuance of equity in connection with arbitration  settlements,  and (iii) the forgiveness of $215.0 thousand due from an unconsolidated affiliate.       General and  administrative  expenses  increased $22.6 thousand in 2005, or 1%,  primarily  as a result of the addition of a disaster  recovery  site in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey. In addition,  we incurred non-cash expenses in 2005 of $80.0 thousand for the impairment of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate.                                        -35-         Occupancy and equipment costs.       Occupancy and equipment expenses increased $423.3 thousand in 2006, or 57%, primarily as a result of the occupancy and equipment  costs  associated with the Sterling Financial Acquisition.       In 2005,  occupancy and equipment  expenses  increased $267.7 thousand,  or 56%,  primarily  as a result of  increased  rent expense due to expansion of our leased  facilities at the corporate  offices in Boca Raton and New York City and the addition of a disaster recovery leased location in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey.       Depreciation and amortization.       Depreciation and  amortization  increased $512.4 thousand in 2006, or 115%, primarily as a result of the amortization  expense  associated with the customer relationships from the Sterling Acquisition.       In 2005,  depreciation and amortization increased $280.2 thousand, or 169%, primarily as a result of the amortization  expense  associated with the customer relationships from the EquityStation Acquisition.       Goodwill impairment.       In 2005,  we recorded  goodwill  impairment  charges of $420.0  thousand to write-off  goodwill from a prior period  acquisition,  when certain brokers left the firm and we determined  there was no longer value  remaining in the goodwill recorded in connection  with the  acquisition.  We had no goodwill  remaining at December 31, 2006 or 2005.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated  Financial Statements contained in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on this gain.       Interest  expense  increased  $29.0 thousand in 2006, or 94% primarily as a result of an increase in capital lease obligations  arising from acquisitions of computer equipment.  Interest expense decreased $363.7 thousand in 2005, or 92%, primarily as a result of the  elimination of interest  expenses  associated with the $1.5 million of debt forgiven in 2004.                                        -36-         Other income,  net  decreased  $28.0  thousand in 2006,  or 27%,  primarily because 2005 results included income from an arbitration  settlement,  which did not recur in 2006, Partially offseting this factor was by sublease rental income recorded in connection with the sublease of property  assumed in connection with the Sterling Financial Acquisition.       We recorded other income, net of $104.8 thousand in 2005, compared to other expense, net of $231.0 thousand in 2004. Other income, net included $62.5 thousand received in the settlement of a legal matter in 2005. Other expenses, net, were comprised primarily of $231.6 thousand of conversion premium expense recorded in connection with a note conversion in 2004.  Income Tax Provision (Benefit)       We account for income taxes in  accordance  with the  provision of SFAS No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income Taxes," which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and  liabilities  at tax rates  expected  to be in effect  when these balances reverse.  Future tax benefits attributable to temporary differences are recognized  to the extent that the  realization  of such benefits is more likely than not. We have  concluded  that it is more likely than not that our  deferred tax assets as of December  31,  2006 and 2005 will not be realized  based on the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected taxable income.  The amount of the deferred tax assets actually realized,  however,  could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income. Should we determine  that we will be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future,  an  adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be recorded in the period such determination is made.       We did not record a provision  for income taxes in 2006 or 2005 as a result of the net loss we recorded in those periods.       We recorded a  provision  for income  taxes of $40.0  thousand in 2004 as a result of Alternative Minimum Taxes under the Internal Revenue Service Code.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       Historically,  we have satisfied our liquidity and regulatory capital needs through the  issuance of equity and debt  securities.  As of December  31, 2006, liquid assets  consisted  primarily of cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 million and marketable securities of $1.4 million, for a total of $5.6 million, which is approximately  $300.0  thousand  higher than $5.3 million in liquid assets as of December 31,  2005.  As of December 31, 2006,  we had  long-term  capital  lease obligations of $125.6 thousand, net of current obligations of $210.8 thousand.       Both vFinance  Investments and EquityStation are subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule (rule 15c3-1),  which  requires the  maintenance of minimum net capital and requires  that the ratio of aggregate  indebtedness  to net capital, both as  defined,  shall not  exceed  15 to 1 (and the rule of the  "applicable" exchange  also  provides  that  equity  capital  may  not be  withdrawn  or cash dividends  paid if the  resulting  net capital  ratio would  exceed 10 to 1). At December 31, 2006, vFinance  Investments had net capital of $1.5 million,  which was $514.5  thousand  in excess of its  required  net  capital of $1.0  million. EquityStation  had net capital of $427.3  thousand  that was $327.3  thousand in excess of its required net capital of $100.0 thousand.                                        -37-         For the periods ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had gross deferred tax assets of $5.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively, which were offset by 100% valuation  allowances.  The valuation  allowances were recorded  against certain deferred tax assets that were generated from net operating losses. In evaluating whether we would  recover  these  deferred  tax assets,  we have not assumed any future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carry-forwards. Based on our history of generating  operating  losses,  management  believes the ability to realize the benefit of net operating  loss  carry-forwards  to offset future taxable income is uncertain. However, future income generation and/or the use of tax planning  strategies to recover these  deferred tax assets could lead to the reversal of the valuation allowances and a reduction in future income tax expense.  We  believe  that  our  estimates  for  the  valuation  allowance  are appropriate, based on current facts and circumstances.       Cash and cash  equivalents  increased  (decreased)  by  $(222.2)  thousand, $(828.9) thousand and $1.5 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The major components of these changes are discussed below.       Cash provided by (used in)  operating  activities  was $(55.6)  thousand in 2006 compared to $(708.5)  thousand in 2005 and $1,409.8  thousand in 2004. Cash provided by (used in)  operating  activities  includes  net income  adjusted for non-cash items and the effects of changes in working capital  including  changes in trading  securities.  Cash used in operating  activities  decreased by $652.9 million in 2006,  primarily as a result of a $405.2 thousand decrease in amounts due from clearing brokers and accounts receivable and a $716.0 thousand increase in  accrued  compensation,  partially  offset by a $413.4  increase  in  trading securities.       Cash used in operating  activities was $708.5 thousand in 2005, compared to cash provided by operating  activities  of $1.4 million in 2004,  primarily as a result of a $3.4 million reduction in net income, partially offset by the effect of a $1.5 million non-cash gain on forgiveness of debt included in net income in 2004.       Cash provided by (used in) investing  activities in 2006 was $41.9 thousand compared to $(90.5)  thousand in 2005 and $79.0  thousand in 2004.  Cash used in investing  activities included capital  expenditures of $222.7 thousand,  $125.7 thousand and $245.8  thousand in 2006,  2005 and 2004,  respectively,  excluding non-cash  additions to property  and  equipment  through  capital  leases.  Cash provided by investing  activities includes the proceeds from sales of securities we received as success fees for investment  banking services of $426.5 thousand, $35.2 thousand and $268.6  thousand in 2006, 2005 and 2004,  respectively.  Cash used in investing  activities in 2006 also included a $161.9 thousand investment in an unconsolidated affiliate.       Cash used in financing  activities in 2006 was $208.5 thousand  compared to $29.9  thousand  in 2005 and $16.3  thousand  in 2004.  Cash  used in  financing activities  was comprised of repayments of capital lease  obligations  of $208.5 thousand,   $143.4   thousand  and  $16.3  thousand  in  2006,  2005  and  2004, respectively, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $113.5 thousand in 2005.  Repayments of capital lease  obligations  increased in 2006 as a result of new capital lease agreements for computer  equipment,  which we entered into during 2005 and 2006 in connection  with the  implementation  of our disaster recovery plan and growth.                                        -38-         We  believe  cash  on hand  is  sufficient  to  meet  our  working  capital requirements over the next twelve months.  However,  we may seek additional debt or equity financing in order to carry out our long-term business strategy.  Such funding may be a result of bank borrowings, public offerings, private placements of equity or debt  securities,  or a combination  thereof.  We cannot be certain that additional debt or equity  financing will be available when required or, if available, that we can secure it on terms satisfactory to us.  Contractual Obligations       The following  table  summarizes our future  contractual  commitments as of December 31, 2006,  consisting  of debt payments  related to capital  leases and future  minimum lease payments under all  non-cancelable  operating  leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year.

In  particular,  we do not have any interest in so-called limited purpose  entities,  which include special purpose entities and structured finance entities.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates       This  discussion  and  analysis  of  financial  condition  and  results  of operations is based on our Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  which have been prepared  in  accordance  with  United  States  generally  accepted   accounting principles.   The  preparation  of  these  financial   statements  requires  our management to make estimates and judgments  that affect the reported  amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we deem reasonable to the situation.  These  estimates and assumptions  form the basis for making  judgments  about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in our estimates could materially  impact our results of  operations  and  financial  condition  in any particular period.  Note 1 to our Consolidated  Financial  Statements includes a summary  of  the  significant  accounting  policies  and  methods  used  in  the preparation of our Consolidated  Financial Statements.  Based on the high degree of  judgment or  complexity  in their  application,  we  consider  our  critical accounting policies and estimates to be:                                        -39-         REVENUE  RECOGNITION.  We periodically  receive equity  instruments,  which include stock purchase warrants and common and preferred stock from companies as part of compensation for  investment-banking  services,  which are classified as available-for-sale  securities in the accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheets. Primarily all such equity  instruments are received from small public  companies and are typically  restricted  as to resale,  generally  receiving  registration rights within one year. When we receive equity  instruments as compensation  for investment  banking  services,  revenue is recognized based on the fair value of these  instruments,  in  accordance  with SFAS No. 115  "Accounting  for Certain Investments  in Debt and  Equity  Securities"  and EITF  00-8  "Accounting  by a Grantee for an Equity  Instrument to be received in  Conjunction  with Providing Goods or Services." We recognize  revenue for these stock purchase warrants when received  based on the Black Scholes  valuation  model.  The revenue  recognized related to other equity  instruments  is  determined  based on available  market information,  discounted by a factor  reflective of the expected  holding period for those  particular  equity  instruments.  The actual  amount of cash proceeds realized from the disposition of these securities may differ materially from the amount of revenue recorded,  as a result of changes in market values between the date of receipt and the date the security is sold.       Occasionally,  we receive equity  instruments in private  companies with no readily available market value. Equity interests and warrants for which there is not a public  market are  valued  based on factors  such as  significant  equity financing by  sophisticated,  unrelated new investors,  history of positive cash flow from operations,  the market value of comparable  publicly traded companies (discounted  for  liquidity)  and  other  pertinent  factors.   Management  also considers  recent offers to purchase a portfolio  company's  securities  and the filings of  registration  statements  in connection  with a portfolio  company's initial public offering when valuing warrants.       CUSTOMER  CLAIMS.   In  the  normal  course  of  business,   our  operating subsidiaries  have been and continue to be the subject of numerous civil actions and arbitrations  arising out of customer complaints relating to activities as a broker-dealer,  as an employer and as a result of other business activities.  In general,  the cases involve various  allegations  that our employees  mishandled customer  accounts.  Based on our historical  experience and  consultation  with counsel,  we typically  reserve an amount we believe will be sufficient to cover any damages  assessed  against us.  However,  we have in the past been  assessed damages that exceeded our  reserves.  If we misjudged the amount of damages that may be assessed against us from pending or threatened claims or if we are unable to  adequately  estimate the amount of damages that will be assessed  against us from  claims  that arise in the future and reserve  accordingly,  our  operating income would be reduced.       FAIR VALUE.  "Investments in trading  securities" and "Securities sold, not yet purchased" on our  Consolidated  Balance Sheets are carried at fair value or amounts that  approximate fair value,  with related  unrealized gains and losses recognized  in our  results  of  operations.  The  estimates  of fair  value are fundamental to our financial condition and results of operations and, in certain circumstances,  require complex judgments.  vFinance Investments relies upon its clearing firms to provide us with these fair values,  because the clearing firms use market data services that provide fair values of securities based on current market prices. In the case of restricted securities,  we further adjust the fair values of securities received to reflect the restrictions.                                        -40-         Fair values for certain  derivative  contracts  are  derived  from  pricing models that consider  current market and  contractual  prices for the underlying financial  instruments or commodities,  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions  impact  the  amount  and  timing of  unrealized  gains  and  losses recognized, and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different  financial  results.  Changes in fixed income and equity  markets will impact  our  estimates  of  fair  value  in the  future,  potentially  affecting principal  trading revenues.  The illiquid nature of certain  securities or debt instruments  also requires a high degree of judgment in  determining  fair value due to the  lack of  listed  market  prices  and  the  potential  impact  of the liquidation of our position on market prices, among other factors.  New Accounting Pronouncements       In December 2004, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.  123R,  and in March  2005 the SEC  issued  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin ("SAB") 107 regarding its interpretation of SFAS No. 123R. The standard requires companies  to  expense  the  grant-date  fair value of stock  options  and other equity-based  compensation  issued to  employees  and is  effective  for  annual periods  beginning  after June 15, 2005.  Effective  January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and related interpretive guidance issued by the FASB and SEC using the modified  prospective  transition  method.  Under the  modified  prospective transition method, SFAS No. 123R applies to new awards modified,  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the awards for which the  requisite  service  period has not been rendered  as of the  required  effective  date is  recognized  as the  requisite service is rendered on or after the required  effective date.  Accordingly,  our Consolidated  Financial  Statements  have not been restated for prior periods to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.       In May 2005,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,  "Accounting  Changes and Error Corrections -A Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3." SFAS No. 154  requires  that a voluntary  change in  accounting  principle be applied retroactively  with all prior period financial  statements  presented on the new accounting  principle,  unless it is  impractical  to do so. This statement also provides  that a change in method of  depreciating  or  amortizing  a long-lived non-financial  asset be  accounted  for as a change in estimate  (prospectively) that was effected by a change in accounting principle. Additionally,  correction of  errors  in  previously  issued  financial  statements  should  be  termed  a "restatement."  The  new  standard  is  effective  for  accounting  changes  and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We adopted SFAS No. 154  effective  January 1, 2006,  which did not have a material impact  on our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  See  Notes  1 and 9 to our Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of SFAS No. 123R.       In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,  establishes  a framework  for  measuring  fair value under generally accepted  accounting  principles,  and expands disclosures about fair  value  measurements.  This  statement  is  effective  for  financial statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after  November  15,  2007,  and interim  periods within those fiscal years.  The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.       In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108 to address  diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential for the build up of improper  amounts on the balance  sheet.  SAB 108  identifies the approach that  registrants   should  take  when  evaluating  the  effects  of  unadjusted misstatements  on  each  financial  statement,  the  circumstances  under  which corrections of misstatements should result in a revision to financial statements and disclosures related to the correction of misstatements. SAB 108 is effective for any report for an  interim  period of the first  fiscal  year  ending  after November 16, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.                                        -41-         In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108, to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential for the build up of improper  amounts on the balance  sheet.

The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.       In  June  2006,  the  FASB  issued  FASB  Interpretation  No.  ("FIN")  48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes." This interpretation applies to all tax  positions  accounted for in accordance  with SFAS No. 109,  Accounting  for Income Taxes.  FIN 48 clarifies  the  application  of FASB  Statement No. 109 by defining the criteria that an individual tax position must meet in order for the position to be  recognized  within the  financial  statements.  It also provides guidance on measurement, de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition for tax positions. This interpretation  is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted.  The adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.       In February  2006,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,  "Accounting  for Certain Hybrid  Financial  Instruments"  which  amends  SFAS No.  133,  "Accounting  for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities." SFAS No. 155 simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial  instruments  by allowing  them to be accounted  for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the whole  instrument  on a fair value basis.  SFAS No. 155 also  clarifies and amends  certain other  provisions of SFAS No.133 and SFAS No.140.  SFAS No.155 is effective for all financial  instruments  acquired, issued or subject to a  remeasurement  event occurring in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  ITEM 7A.          QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.       We have exposure to market risk, and periodically  hedge against that risk. We do not hold or issue any  derivative  financial  instruments  for  trading or other  speculative  purposes.  We are  exposed to market  risk  associated  with changes in the fair market value of the marketable  securities that we hold. Our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected by declines in the volume of securities transactions and in market liquidity, which generally result in lower revenues from trading activities and commissions.  Lower securities price levels may also  result in a reduced  volume of  transactions,  as well as losses  from declines in the market  value of  securities  we hold in trading and  investment positions.  Sudden sharp declines in market values of securities and the failure of issuers and counterparts to perform their  obligations can result in illiquid markets in which we may incur losses in its principal trading activities.                                        -42-    ITEM 8.
