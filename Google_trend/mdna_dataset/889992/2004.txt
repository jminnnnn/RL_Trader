Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS            The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto. This discussion may be deemed to include forward-looking statements  Forward Looking Information            This report on Form 10-K contains certain forward looking statements and information relating to Ortec, that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by management, utilizing currently available information. When used in this document, the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," and "expect" and similar expressions, as they relate to Ortec, are intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in this discussion and elsewhere in this Form 10-K report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially and adversely from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. We do not intend to update these forward looking statements.  General  Since our inception we have been principally engaged in the research and development of our tissue engineered skin regeneration product, for use in the treatment of chronic and acute wounds, such as venous and diabetic skin ulcers and autograft donor site wounds for burn victims. We call our product OrCel'r' and in June 2001 we filed a trademark application for such name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  In February 2001 we received FDA approval to make commercial sales of OrCel for use in reconstructive surgery on patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, followed by FDA approval in September 2001 for use of the product in the treatment of donor site wounds in burn patients. With these approvals, though we are still a development stage enterprise, in December 2001 we began commercial sales of our product. During 2002, we engaged a sales force organization to actively pursue sales of our product, but due to a reduction in anticipated financing, we curtailed these activities in the second half of 2002 in order to focus our efforts and resources towards completing the clinical trials for the use of OrCel for the treatment of venous stasis ulcers. As a result of this curtailment, there have been no commercial sales of our product in the current year ended December 31, 2003.  In 2003, we completed a pivotal clinical trial for the use of OrCel in its cryopreserved form for the treatment of venous stasis ulcers. Venous stasis ulcers are open lesions on the legs, which result from the poor circulation of blood returning from the legs to the heart. The study was conducted at 19 clinical sites and 136 patients were treated in the trial. One half of the patients were a control group and were treated with standard of care currently being used for treatment of venous stasis ulcers. In December 2003, we initiated the filing of the Premarket Approval (PMA) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market OrCel for the      treatment of venous leg ulcers. We submitted the Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) section, the first of two modules of the application. The final section of the PMA, which included a summary of safety and effectiveness in the clinical studies and device labeling, was filed with the FDA in February 2004.  In June 2002, we received approval from the FDA to initiate a pivotal clinical trial using OrCel in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetic ulcers are open sores that remain after the destruction of surface tissue. We have deferred the implementation of the diabetic foot ulcers pivotal clinical trial until after FDA determination of whether we may make commercial sales of cryopreserved OrCel to treat venous stasis ulcers.  From inception to date, we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately $103 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and may have to discontinue operations, unless we are able to secure FDA clearance for the sale of OrCel in its cyropreserved form to treat venous leg ulcers, and later diabetic foot ulcers, gain market acceptance for OrCel, and execute our production plans with our third party manufacturer.  In October 2003, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement for the production of OrCel with Cambrex Bio Science Walkerville, Inc, a subsidiary of Cambrex Corporation. Cambrex's current capacity is expected to meet our commercial manufacturing requirements for the first twelve months following the market launch of OrCel if and when we receive FDA approval for the sale of our product for use in the treatment of patients with venous stasis ulcers. This agreement will allow us to avoid the costlier plan of constructing our owned manufacturing facility. We are also concurrently in the process of evaluating various sales and marketing collaborative arrangements for the distribution of our product in the United States.  In October 2003 we entered into an agreement with Teva Medical, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, under which Teva Medical obtained a license to promote and sell our tissue engineered wound healing product, OrCel, in Israel for the treatment of chronic wounds and other dermatological applications.  We anticipate that future revenues and results of operations may continue to fluctuate significantly depending on, among other factors, the timing and outcome of applications for additional regulatory approvals, our ability to successfully manufacture, market and distribute OrCel and/or the establishment of collaborative arrangements for the marketing and distribution of our product. We anticipate that our operating activities will result in substantial net losses until we obtain FDA clearance to sell OrCel and we successfully market OrCel for the treatment of venous leg ulcers.  Critical Accounting Estimates  Revenue Recognition. Product revenue is recognized upon shipment of OrCel when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which occurs when the product is received by the end user hospital. Royalties from licensees will be based on third-party sales of licensed products and will be recorded in accordance with contract terms when third-party results are reliably measurable and      collectibility is reasonable assured. Fees paid to Ortec upon entering a license agreement are recognized when earned as defined by the terms of the agreement.  Research and Development Costs. As we are still engaged in clinical trials of our product and remain a development stage enterprise, the cost of producing product for clinical trials and for sale, is included in Research and Development costs. Additionally, all research and development costs, which comprise of Product Production and laboratory costs, Rent, Consulting, Personnel and Depreciation and Amortization expenses, are expensed as incurred.  Obligation under Revenue Interest Assignment. We account for our Revenue Interest Assignment Agreement with Paul Capital in a manner similar to that of debt. Currently, our liabilities exceed the value of our assets and as such, we are technically in default of the solvency requirement under this agreement. Pursuant to the default provisions, which entitles Paul Capital to compel us to repurchase its interest in our revenues at a price equal to hundred thirty (130) percent of $10,000,000, the purchase price paid to Ortec by Paul Capital, interest on such debt has been accrued at an amount which would yield a 30% internal rate of return to Paul Capital. At such time when the default provisions are no longer applicable and a reasonable estimate of future revenues can be determined, the effective interest rate imputed on the obligation will be determined using the interest method and payments to Paul Capital will be recorded as a reduction of the Company's obligation under the revenue interest assignment. This may result in an imputed interest rate, which is significantly below 30% and could have a potential material financial impact. However, no assurances can be given that such lower rate could be achieved. Additionally, we had no revenues in 2003 as we suspended sales of OrCel in 2002 to focus on completing a clinical trial for venous leg ulcers and submitting the results to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We hope to obtain FDA approval to sell OrCel for the treatment of venous leg ulcers in the second half of 2004; however approval cannot be assured. In addition, if approval is obtained from the FDA, the timing of such event may not be in line with our expectations. For these reasons, we may not be able to make a reasonable estimate of future revenues and payments that may become due to Paul Capital under this financing agreement in 2004, if we are no longer in technical default of this agreement, and as such may not be able to determine an effective interest rate to apply to the debt. Therefore, given these uncertainties, once we are no longer in technical default, we will charge revenue interest expense as revenues subject to the revenue interest obligation are recognized. When we are able to make a reasonable estimate of our related revenue interest obligation, interest expense will be charged based upon the interest method.  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. A variable interest entity often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property. A variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in activities on behalf of another company. Until now, a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests. FIN No. 46 changes that by requiring a variable interest entity      to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. FIN No. 46's consolidation requirements apply immediately to variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after December 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The Company has adopted FIN No. 46 effective January 31, 2003. The adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.  In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 ("SFAS No. 149"), Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 except for the provisions that were cleared by the FASB in prior pronouncements. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 149 to have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations.  In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 ("SFAS No. 150"), "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. In accordance with the standard, financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities. This Statement shall be effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise shall be effective in the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.  Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002.  Revenues  We earned revenues of approximately $244,000 in 2002 from commercial shipments of products to customers. As previously discussed, our sales activities were curtailed in the second half of 2002, resulting in no product sales for the year ended December 31, 2003.  Expenses  Expenses decreased by approximately $5.9 million from approximately $21.8 million in 2002 to approximately $15.9 million in 2003.      Production and laboratory costs. These expenses decreased by $0.2 million from $3.1 million in 2002 to $2.9 million in 2003. The decrease in production and laboratory costs was due to the fact that during 2003 costs were incurred primarily for the venous ulcer pivotal clinical trial, whereas in 2002 costs were incurred for venous and diabetic ulcers pilot trials and beginning the venous pivotal trial. In 2002 there were also significant costs incurred to manufacture product for sale, which is included in Production and laboratory costs. This decrease in production and laboratory costs was partly offset by suite fees incurred in 2003 in connection with our cell therapy manufacturing arrangement with Cambrex, our third party manufacturer, and a settlement charge pursuant to an agreement with Dr. Eisenberg.  Consulting. These fees decreased by $.5 million compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Lower consulting expenses are due to the fact that the company has been focused on completing the venous stasis clinical trial, and as such have utilized primarily existing personnel. The 2002 period included costs incurred as a result of product and process improvement projects, as well as for the clinical trials.  Personnel. Personnel costs decreased by approximately $2.5 million to $3.9 million in 2003, compared with $6.4 million in 2002 due to lower headcount and a reduction in executive salary. The reduction in expense in 2003 resulted from management's decision in June 2002 to curtail manufacturing of product for sale and focus completely on conducting the pivotal venous stasis clinical trial. The headcount and personnel costs were higher in the 2002 periods as we had increased staffing to manage two clinical trials, manufacture the increased quantity of product required by our clinical trial programs and for commercial sales, initiate our sales and marketing program for our FDA approved product, and for additional administrative personnel required as a result of such increased staffing levels.  General and Administrative. These expenses decreased by $0.2 million from $2.8 million in 2002 to $2.5 million in 2003 due principally to reduced marketing and recruitment expenses incurred in 2003 compared with 2002, in which period we were preparing for commercial sales of our product. This decrease was partly offset by higher legal fees in 2003 relating to financing activities and lawsuit settlements.  Rent and Lease Termination Costs. Rent expense decreased by $55,000 due to reductions in space leased at all office locations. During the 2nd quarter of 2003, the Company and NJEDA executed an agreement to terminate the lease of the New Jersey premises, and in accordance with terms of this settlement, we recorded termination expenses of $1.1 as of June 30, 2003. These costs included $.9 million in lease settlement costs paid to the NJEDA, and the write-off of $.2 million of other leasehold costs incurred directly by us.  Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $2.5 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease is primarily due to $2.2 million in interest recorded on convertible debt, which was converted in 2002. The 2003 and 2002 periods included the non-cash imputed interest accrued on the Paul Capital agreement. Although interest was accrued at 30% per annum for both periods, at December 31, 2003, interest was accrued on a higher level of debt outstanding. Due to the default provisions under the agreement, interest has been accrued at 30% per annum in      2003, which provision may be adjusted in the future if the default provisions are not longer applicable and interest will then be accrued based on the expected level of future revenues.  Year Ended December 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001.  Revenues  We earned revenues of approximately $244,000 in 2002, and $22,000 in 2001 from commercial shipments of products to customers. Sales to commercial customers began in December 2001, and were curtailed in the second half of 2002.  Expenses  Expenses increased by approximately $5.9 million in 2002, from approximately $15.9 million in 2001 to $21.8 million in 2002. Interest, which primarily consisted of non-cash charges relating to the preferred stock and debentures financings, accounted for $6.7 million of this increase, while the loss on extinguishment of debt represented $1.0 million of the increase. Other expenses incurred in 2002, decreased by $1.8 million, compared with 2001.  Production and laboratory costs. These expenses decreased by approximately $1.1 million, from $4.3 million in 2001 to $3.2 million in 2002. Additionally, 2001 costs included a $0.4 million credit to expenses as a result of an insurance recovery for damaged OrCel, which costs were incurred in 2000. All other research and development costs decreased by $1.5 million in 2002, compared with 2001. This decrease in research and development expenses was due to the fact that the costs incurred in 2002 included only one clinical trial, the venous ulcer pivotal trial, whereas in 2001 there were three trials conducted and concluded, the donor site pivotal trial, and the venous and diabetic ulcers pilot trials. We concluded the venous ulcer pivotal trial in 2003.  Personnel. Personnel costs decreased by approximately $.2 million from $6.6 million in 2001 to $6.4 million in 2002. Personnel costs initially increased in the first half of 2002 due to the additional personnel required to conduct and manage clinical trial programs, to manufacture the increased quantity of product required by our clinical trial programs and for the commercial sales and to initiate our sales and marketing program for our FDA approved products. In July 2002, management implemented a cost reduction plan and deferred the implementation of the diabetic clinical trial, as well as reduced production of product for commercial sales, which resulted in significant reductions in personnel costs in the second half of 2002. As a result of our cost reduction plan, 34 employees were terminated and the Company paid $40,000 in termination benefits in July 2002. No other costs were incurred as a result of these terminations.  Consulting. These fees decreased by $.9 million from $1.4 million in 2001 to $.5 million in 2002. This was due to the increased costs in 2001 related to the specific requirements for concluding the clinical trials for donor site wounds and FDA submissions, noted above, as well as, the costs of conducting the pilot clinical trials for venous leg stasis and diabetic foot ulcers. In 2002, only the costs of beginning the pivotal clinical trials for venous leg stasis ulcers were incurred.      General and Administrative. These expenses increased by $.1 million from $2.7 million in 2001 to $2.8 million in 2002. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to increased marketing expenses incurred early in the year, as we prepared for commercial sales of our product. As noted above, the decision to reduce fresh OrCel production in the third quarter resulted in a curtailment of marketing expense in the second half of the year. In 2002, we also incurred higher expenses, as we continued our intense financing efforts. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of travel expenses in 2002, as we focused on reducing our overall spending.  Rent. This expense increased by $.1 million in 2002 compared with 2001, primarily due to the charges incurred for the New Jersey leases in 2002, which expense was not incurred in 2001.  Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $6.7 million, from $.5 million in 2001 to $7.2 million in 2002. This increase was due to the imputed non-cash interest resulting from the convertible debenture and convertible preferred financings, which occurred in 2002. Interest of $3.6 million was recorded as a result of these financings, $.2 million in coupon rate interest on the debentures and $3.4 million recorded as the fair market value of the conversion features and warrants issued with the financings. Additionally, non-cash interest of $3.5 million was accrued in 2002, relating to the Paul Capital Royalty obligation, as compared to $.5 million in 2001.  Interest Income. Interest income declined by approximately $.2 million in 2002, compared with 2001, primarily due to the smaller average cash balances outstanding during 2002 compared with 2001.  Loss on extinguishment of debt and series A preferred shares. We incurred a loss of $1.0 million due to the conversion of debt into preferred shares in 2002.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Since inception (March 12, 1991) through December 31, 2003, we have accumulated a deficit of approximately $103 million and we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses until we obtain FDA approval to sell our product, OrCel, for the treatment of venous leg ulcers and successfully market OrCel to the medical community. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our common stock, preferred stock, promissory notes payable and convertible debentures, our initial public offering, and the exercise of our publicly traded Class A warrants at the end of 1997. From inception to December 31, 2003, we received cash proceeds from the sale of equity securities, net of share issuance expenses, of approximately $53.6 million, we received net cash proceeds from the issuance of debentures, promissory notes and preferred stock of $13.7 million, and we have received a total of $10.0 million from the sale of a percentage interest in our future revenues from the sale of our product in North America.  For the year ended December 31, 2003, we used net cash for operating activities of approximately $9.3 million. Cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net loss of $15.9 million, offset by depreciation and amortization of approximately $.6 million, approximately $4.6 million of non-cash interest expense and approximately $1.1 million in costs for lease termination costs, relating to the NJEDA lease, of which approximately $.3 million was a cash payment in the twelve-month period.      In 2003, we received gross proceeds of $7.7 million from the issuance of preferred stock, $3.1 million from the issuance of promissory notes, advances of $.1 million against future financings and incurred $.8 million in financing costs. As a result of such preferred stock financing, common shares outstanding increased by 2.9 million shares, due to the conversion of preferred stock, the exercise of warrants and the issuance of common stock for dividends payable on preferred stock.  On June 24, 2003, Ortec executed a reverse split of its common shares, warrants, and options outstanding, whereby every stockholder, warrant holder, and option holder was granted one new common share, warrant, or option for every ten common shares, warrants, or options outstanding prior to June 24, 2003. The par value of the common shares remained unchanged at $.001 per share. However, the exercise prices of the warrants and options outstanding were adjusted as a result of this reverse split. This reverse stock split is retroactively reflected in the accompanying financial statements and all reference to shares are to the new shares with per share amounts appropriately adjusted.  In August 2001 we entered into a Revenue Interests Assignment agreement with Paul Capital Royalty Acquisition Fund, L.P. pursuant to which we agreed in consideration of Paul Capital paying us $10,000,000, to pay to Paul Capital 3 1/3% of the end user sales prices paid for our OrCel product in the United States, Canada and Mexico through the period ending in 2011. Such percentage interest in our revenues in those three countries may be adjusted upward or downward based on the volume of sales to end users of OrCel in those three countries. In accordance with the terms of the Revenue Interest Agreement, beginning on January 1, 2003 we are required to make advances payments on the revenue interest obligation as follows: the first $0.6 million of annual net sales for the year ended December 31,2003; the first $1.0 million of annual net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the first $7.5 million of annual net sales for each subsequent calendar year thereafter through the year ending December 31, 2011. The Company did not pay Paul Capital $0.6 million in 2003 as we discontinued the commercial sale of OrCel in the second half of 2002 due to budgetary constraints resulting from a difficult investment climate. We will not resume sales unless we obtain FDA approval for the use of OrCel in the treatment of venous stasis ulcers, which is not expected to occur before the second half of 2004.  As security for the performance of our obligations to Paul Capital, we have granted Paul Capital a security interest in all of our U.S. patents, patent applications and trademarks. Our agreement with Paul Capital provides that in certain events Paul Capital may, at its option, compel us to repurchase the interest in our revenues that we sold to Paul Capital for a price equal to the $10,000,000 Paul Capital paid us plus an amount that would yield Paul Capital a 30% internal rate of return on their investment. That repurchase price would have been approximately $18,553,856 as of December 31, 2003. Among the events that would entitle Paul Capital to compel us to repurchase its interest in our revenues at that price is if we are insolvent or if we are unable to pay our debts as they become due. Our agreement with Paul Capital provides that in determining such insolvency any amount we owe to Paul Capital is excluded in calculating our net worth (or negative net worth). As defined in our agreement with Paul Capital we are currently insolvent. In addition, although we are currently trying to manage our debt we are not      paying our debts as they become due. Although Paul Capital has had the right for well over a year to compel us to repurchase its interest in our revenues at the price provided in our agreement, Paul Capital has so far not exercised that right. If Paul Capital does exercise its right to compel us to repurchase its interest in our revenues we would be unable to pay the purchase price and Paul Capital could foreclose its security interest in our U.S. patents, patent applications and trademarks and in such event we will have to discontinue our business operations.  In addition to the requirement that the Company remain solvent, as described above, the occurrence of certain events, including those set forth below, triggers Paul Capital's right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest:       o    a change of control of our company;       o    the transfer of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets;       o    the transfer of all or any part of our respective interests in our           products other than pursuant to any distribution agreements, license           agreements and future agreements; and       o    a judicial decision that has a material adverse effect on our           business, operations, assets or financial condition as defined by the           agreement.  If a repurchase event occurred and Paul Capital required us to repurchase their interest in our revenues, the Company may not have sufficient cash funds to pay Paul Capital. As such, the investor could foreclose on certain assets that are essential to our operations. The exact amount of the repurchase price is dependent upon certain factors, including when the repurchase event occurs. At December 31, 2003, since the Company was technically in default of the solvency requirement under the Revenue Interest Assignment agreement, we provided for an amount that approximated what we would have owed Paul Capital had they exercised their repurchase option. To date, Paul Capital has not exercised this option and has not indicated to us that they intend to compel us to repurchase its revenue interest. Once the Company is no longer insolvent and therefore no longer in technical breach of the agreement, Paul Capital bears the risk of revenue interest paid to it being significantly less than the revenue interest liability, as well as the reward of revenue interest paid to it being significantly greater than the interest liability.  In February 2003, Paul Capital amended its agreement with us, restating and updating certain provisions of the original agreement. The original agreement and modifications to the agreement terminate on December 31, 2011, unless terminated earlier by either party, as permitted by the terms of the agreement.  In January 2002, we secured a $1.3 million lease line of credit with GE Capital which enabled us to finance our fixed assets needs, such as laboratory and laboratory support equipment, computer hardware and office furniture. In January 2002 and October 2002, we drew $268,000 and $181,000, respectively. Each equipment purchase has a fixed lease term of 36 months. For equipment acquired in 2002, the Company is obligated to make future rental payments during the years ending December 31, 2004 and 2005 of $160,000 and $43,000, respectively. This line of credit expired in 2002.  On March 27, 2002, we engaged an investment-banking firm to act as our financial advisor in connection with raising capital for us through debt and/or equity financing. Using these services      we have raised financing of approximately $8.2 million in 2002 and in 2003 we have raised an additional $2.0 million from the sale of Series B convertible preferred stock in February 2003 and $5.7 million from the sale of Series C convertible preferred stock in May and July 2003. As part of the February financing, we issued 200,000 Series A warrants at $.001 per share, which were immediately converted into 200,000 common shares, 100,000 Series B-1 and 100,000 Series B-2 warrants exercisable at $15.00 per share and $20.00 per share, respectively. Concurrent with the Series B conversion and giving effect to the reverse stock split, the exercise prices of these warrants were reduced to $4.00 and $5.00, respectively. Dividends on our Series B preferred stock sold in such financing were paid in common shares at the rate of 12% per annum, resulting in the issue of 92,307 shares of common stock. The investors in the Series B preferred stock issued in February 2003, along with all previous issues in 2002, agreed to convert their Series B preferred shares into common shares and Series D preferred shares (common stock equivalent) on May 23, 2003. The Company finalized the conversion of the Series B preferred stock into the Series D preferred stock on August 29, 2003. Only the 50 shares of Series B preferred stock owned by Paul Capital were not converted.  On May 23, 2003 and July 29, 2003 we closed on Series C preferred stock equity financing of $5.7 million from investors, some of whom have previously participated in the $10.2 million raised through 2002 and 2003 prior to that date. The Series C convertible preferred stock has a stated value of $6,000 per share and is convertible into common shares at a rate of $ 2.00 per share. Dividends will be paid in cash, or common shares at our option, at the rate of 10% per annum. An accrued dividend of $336,550 at December 31, 2003 has been provided for within stockholders' equity/(deficit) as the Company's current intent is to issue common shares in payment of these dividends. Beginning 180 days from issue, the Series C convertible preferred stock shall automatically convert if the common stock of the Company trades at a price equal to or greater than $6.00 per share for a period of 10 consecutive trading days. Additionally, each investor was issued 1,800 five-year warrants for each Series C convertible preferred share purchased. The Series C warrants have an exercise price of $3.60 per common share. Beginning twenty-four months after the Closing, the Company may redeem the Series C warrants for $.01 per warrant if its common stock closes above $10.80 per share for 10 consecutive trading days.  Concurrently with the closing of this Series C convertible preferred stock financing, on May 23, 2003 a majority in interest of the holders of our Series B convertible preferred stock agreed to convert their preferred shares into common shares or its equivalent, at the conversion rate of $2.50 per share. As a result of this conversion, 605.389 shares of Series B preferred stocks were converted into 2,421,556 shares of common stock and shares of 482.885 Series B preferred stock were converted into a similar number amount of shares of Series D preferred stock, which are equivalent to 1,931,540 shares of common stock. Only the 50 shares of Series B preferred stock owned by Paul Capital were not converted. Additionally, as a result of the conversion, the exercise price of the B-1and B-2 warrants relating to the converted Series B preferred stock, were adjusted from $15.00 and $20.00, respectively, to $4.00 and $5.00, respectively. Beginning twelve months after issue, the B-1 and B-2 Warrants are redeemable for $.01 per share if our common stock closes above $10.00 and $12.50, respectively, for 10 consecutive trading days.  In October 2003, we entered into a cell therapy manufacturing agreement with Cambrex Bio Science Walkerville, Inc., a subsidiary of Cambrex Corporation, for the commercial manufacture      of Ortec's tissue engineered product, OrCel. It is expected that Cambrex will begin production of OrCel in the first half of 2004 and this inventory may be used for sale in the second half of 2004 if we receive FDA clearance to market OrCel for use on patients in the treatment of venous leg ulcers. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, we are required to pay Cambrex $100,000 per month for the use of a production suite in their facility located in Walkersville, Maryland while we are in Phase I of the production plan, as defined by the agreement. During Phase I only, we may terminate this agreement by giving 6 months advance notice of the effective date of such termination, however no such termination will be effective prior to the date 12 months after the commencement date for Phase I. At any time during Phase I, we can elect to initiate Phase II of the agreement by written notice to Cambrex. The annual payments we will make to Cambrex will increase to $2,100,000 per year if we require Cambrex to build us a larger production facility to meet our requirements for the production of OrCel. Such annual payments we are required to make will increase by a small percentage each year. Such annual payments include some services and overhead expenses provided and paid for by Cambrex. We are required to pay a portion of the cost of construction of that larger production facility. However, the amount we contribute to the construction of that larger facility will be repaid to us by credits against a portion of the future annual payments of $2,100,000 and of certain other payments we are required to make to Cambrex after the larger facility is in use. We are also required to pay specified hourly charges for the Cambrex employees engaged in the production of OrCel as well as certain other charges. After construction of the larger production facility we are required to acquire from Cambrex virtually all of our requirements for OrCel that Cambrex can produce. Prior to our election to have Cambrex construct the larger production facility for us, either we or Cambrex may terminate the agreement on six months notice by us and 12 months notice by Cambrex, except that such termination will not be effective prior to November 1, 2004. If we elect to have Cambrex construct the larger production facility for us the agreement will continue for 6 years after the larger production facility is constructed. However, even after such construction we and Cambrex may elect to scale down over the following three years the portion of our requirements for OrCel that Cambrex will produce for us. We may elect the scale down period at any time after one year after the larger production facility is constructed and in operation in which event there are additional payments we must make to Cambrex. Either Cambrex or we may elect the scale down period later than 3 years after that facility is in operation and neither of us will be required to make any additional payments to the other because of that election. If after the construction of the larger production facility, we breach a material term of our agreement with Cambrex, or elect to terminate the agreement, there are substantial payments we must make to Cambrex.  In October, November, and December 2003, and January 2004, we received loans payable in June 30, 2004, aggregating $3,790,000. These notes accrue interest at 8% per annum. In February 2004 we received a $250,000 loan which is payable on demand. We will need to raise capital in 2004 to repay these commitments.  As of December 31, 2003, payment of approximately $2,500,000 of the approximately $2,900,000 we owed to our trade creditors was past due. While we have arranged for payment of some our obligations over a period of time, and have to make some payments of past due obligations to our current and ongoing suppliers, our ability to make payments we have agreed to pay and to insure continued receipt of needed supplies, and to continue reducing our past due      obligations, will depend on our ability to secure needed financing. Raising additional capital can be dependent on numerous factors, such as our ability to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of OrCel to treat venous stasis ulcers, and, later diabetic foot ulcers as well as the general investment climate.  A summary of our contractual obligation requirements as of December 31, 2003 is as follows:                                                        Payments due by period                                                    Less than        1-3        3-5                                        Total         1 year        years      years                                     -----------   -----------   ----------   -------          Loan Payable                        $   708,684   $   212,503   $  465,759   $30,422 Promissory Notes Payable    (including interest)               3,283,800     3,283,800 Capital Lease Obligation                208,362       165,207       43,155 Operating Leases                        738,000       361,000      377,000 Other Obligations: Settlement with Dr. Eisenberg (1)       398,574       398,574 Cell Therapy Manufacturing    Agreement (Cambrex) (1)            1,000,000     1,000,000 Obligation under Revenue    Interest Assignment (2)           18,553,856    18,553,856                                     ------------------------------------------------                                     $25,330,076   $24,106,740   $1,192,914   $30,422                                     ================================================   (1) See Note 12 to the financial statements for settlement terms relating to the agreement with Dr. Eisenberg and our contractual obligation under our Cell Therapy Manufacturing Agreement with Cambrex.  (2) See Note 8 to the financial statements for repayment terms.  We require substantial funding to continue our research and development activities, clinical trials, manufacturing, sales, distribution and administrative activities. We have raised funds in the past through the public or private sale of equity securities and debentures, the issuance of promissory notes to lenders all but a few of whom were investors in our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, and through the agreement with Paul Capital. We will need to raise additional funds in the future through collaborative arrangements with a pharmaceutical sales company and through the sale of our securities to the public and through private placements, debt financing or short-term loans. We can give no assurance of the total amount of financing that will be secured. We are continuing to use the services of an investment banking firm in raising capital in 2004. Our capital funding requirements depend on numerous factors, including:       o    the progress and magnitude of our research and development programs;       o    the time involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial           sale of our OrCel product in its cryopreserved form to treat venous           stasis ulcers, and later diabetic foot ulcers;           o    the costs involved in filing and maintaining patent claims;       o    technological advances;       o    competitive and market conditions;       o    our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements;       o    the successful implementation of an agreement we have entered into           with Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc. for manufacturing of our           OrCel product in its cryopreserved form; and       o    the cost and effectiveness of commercialization activities and           arrangements.  We are currently in the process of completing a registration statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register shares of our common stock and warrants. Once our registration statement become effective, we hope to receive net proceeds, after payment of placement fees and other expenses we incur in connection with the filing, of approximately $11 million through the sale of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock together with the issuance of warrants to purchase an additional 3,000,000 shares of our common stock. We estimate this financing we hope to raise in 2004, will enable us to execute our production plan with our third party manufacturer and prepare for sales in 2004, pay a portion of our past due obligations, repay a portion of our short-term promissory note borrowings, initiate the pivotal clinical trial for the use of OrCel in its cryopreserved form for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, and provide for our general and corporate working capital requirements for 2004. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2003, (approximately $1.2 million) and the $650,000 we have already raised in 2004, as well as the additional $11.0 million we hope to raise in 2004 may enable us to continue our operations for the next 12 months. However, we can give no assurance that additional investment or other funds can be secured. Additionally, we are also likely to continue to encounter difficulties which are common to development stage companies, including unanticipated costs relating to development, delays in the testing of products, regulatory approval and compliance and competition.  We continue to explore and, as appropriate, enter into discussions with other companies regarding the potential for equity investment, collaborative arrangements, license agreements or other funding programs with us, in exchange for marketing, distribution or other rights to our product. However, we can give no assurance that discussions with other companies will result in any additional investments, collaborative arrangements, agreements or other funding, or that the necessary additional financing through debt or equity financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Further, we can give no assurance that any arrangements resulting from these discussions will successfully reduce our funding requirements. If additional funding is not available to us when needed, we may not be able to continue operations.  Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
