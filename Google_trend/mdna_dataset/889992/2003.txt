Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto. This discussion may be deemed to include forward-looking statements.  Forward Looking Information May Prove Inaccurate  This Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward looking statements and information relating to Ortec, that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. When used in this document, the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," and "expect" and similar expressions, as they relate to Ortec, are intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in this discussion and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. We do not intend to update these forward-looking statements.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto. This discussion may be deemed to include forward-looking statements.  General  Since Ortec's inception we have been principally engaged in the research and development of our tissue engineered skin regeneration product, for use in the treatment of chronic and acute wounds, such as venous and diabetic skin ulcers, and autograft donor site wounds for burn victims. We call our product OrCel'TM' and in June 2001 we filed a trademark application for such name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  In February 2001, we received FDA approval to make commercial sales of OrCel for use on patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, followed by FDA approval in September 2001 for use of the product in the treatment of donor site wounds in burn patients. With these approvals, though we are still a development stage enterprise, in December 2001 we began commercial sales of our product, generating revenues of $22,000 and $244,000 in 2001 and 2002, respectively. During 2002, we engaged a sales force organization to actively pursue the sales of our product, but due to a reduction in anticipated financing, we had to curtail these activities in the second half of the year.  From inception to date, we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately $81.9 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through 2004, due to continued spending on research and development programs, the funding of clinical trials and regulatory activities and the increased costs of manufacturing, marketing and sales, distribution and administrative activities.                                          13          We are currently conducting a pivotal clinical trial using OrCel in the treatment of venous stasis ulcers. Venous stasis ulcers are open lesions on the legs, which result from the poor circulation of blood returning from the legs to the heart. As of March 14, 2003, we have enrolled over 80 patients to participate in the pivotal clinical trial and we are anticipating a total enrollment of 102 patients to complete the trial. We expect to complete the venous stasis pivotal clinical trials during the second quarter of 2003, with submission of the FDA filing in September 2003. We anticipate obtaining FDA approval early in 2004 for the use of our OrCel product in the treatment of venous stasis ulcers.  In June 2002, we received approval from the FDA to initiate a pivotal clinical trial using OrCel in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetic ulcers are open sores that remain after the destruction of surface tissue. We have deferred the implementation of the diabetic foot ulcers pivotal clinical trial and expect to resume this trial in the second half of 2003 dependent on obtaining sufficient additional financing, with FDA approval anticipated by the end of 2004.  We are investigating and currently are in discussions with a third party manufacturer for the production of OrCel. If these discussions are successful, we will be able to produce the large quantities of OrCel that will be required upon the anticipated receipt of FDA approval for the sale of our product for use in the treatment of patients with venous stasis ulcers. If we conclude an agreement with the third party manufacturer, we will be able to defer or terminate the costlier plan of constructing our owned manufacturing facility. We are also concurrently in the process of evaluating various sales and marketing collaborative arrangements.  We anticipate that future revenues and results of operations may continue to fluctuate significantly depending on, among other factors, the timing and outcome of applications for additional regulatory approvals, our ability to successfully manufacture, market and distribute OrCel and/or the establishment of collaborative arrangements for the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our product. We anticipate that our operating activities will result in substantial net losses through 2004.  Critical Accounting Estimates  Revenue Recognition. Revenues from sales are recognized upon shipment of product to customers.  Research and Development Costs. As we are still engaged in clinical trials of our product and remain a development stage enterprise, the cost of producing product for clinical trials and for sale, is included in Research and Development costs. Additionally, all research and development costs, including consulting and personnel costs, relating to products under development, are expensed as incurred.                                          14         Long Term Obligations. We account for our Revenue Interest Assignment Agreement in a manner similar to that of debt and provide for interest to reflect the estimated cost of the funds anticipated under the terms of the agreement. Pursuant to the default provisions under the agreement, interest is accrued at 30% per annum. At such time when the default provisions are no longer applicable, interest will be accrued based upon the expected level of future revenues, which may result in a lower imputed interest rate, with potential material financial impact.  Impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements  On April 30, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued SFAS No.145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No.4, 44 and 64, Amendment of SFAS No.13 and Technical Corrections". SFAS No.145 rescinds Statement No.4, which requires all gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net the related income tax effect. Upon adoption of SFAS No.145, companies will be required to apply the criteria in APB Opinion No.30, "Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" in determining the classification of gains and losses resulting from the extinguishment of debt. SFAS No.145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. We are currently evaluating the requirements and impact of the statement on our results of operations and financial position.  On July 30, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities". The standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred, rather than at a date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Example of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operations, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. SFAS No.146 is to be applied prospectively to exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We will apply the provisions of this statement prospectively to disposal activities commencing after December 31. 2002.  In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No.123". This statement requires companies to reflect the fair market value of employee stock based compensation in their results of operations as an additional expense or disclose the pro-forma impact of this adjustment to net income and earnings per share, in the notes to the financial statements. The Company has elected to continue to account for its stock-based compensation under the rules of APB Opinion No.25, with footnote disclosure, as required by SFAS No.148.  Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001.                                          15         Revenues  We earned revenues of approximately $244,000 in 2002, and $22,000 in 2001 from commercial shipments of products to customers. Sales to commercial customers began in December 2001, and were curtailed in the second half of 2002.  Expenses  Expenses increased by approximately $5.9 million in 2002, from approximately $15.9 million in 2001 to $21.8 million in 2002. Interest, which primarily consisted of non-cash charges relating to the preferred stock and debentures financings, accounted for $6.7 million of this increase, while the loss on extinguishment of debt represented $1.0 million of the increase. Other expenses incurred in 2002, decreased by $1.8 million, compared with 2001.  Research and Development. These expenses decreased by approximately $1.1 million, from $4.3 million in 2001 to $3.2 million in 2002. Additionally, 2001 costs included a $0.4 million credit to expenses as a result of an insurance recovery for damaged Orcel, which costs were incurred in 2000. All other research and development costs decreased by $1.5 million in 2002, compared with 2001. This decrease in research and development expenses was due to the fact that the costs incurred in 2002 included only one clinical trial, the venous ulcer pivotal trial, whereas in 2001 there were three trials conducted and concluded, the donor site pivotal trial, and the venous and diabetic ulcers pilot trials. We expect to conclude the venous ulcer pivotal trial in 2003.  Personnel. Personnel costs decreased by approximately $.2 million from $6.6 million in 2001 to $6.4 million in 2002. Personnel costs initially increased in the first half of 2002 due to the additional personnel required to conduct and manage clinical trial programs, to manufacture the increased quantity of product required by our clinical trial programs and for commercial sales and to initiate our sales and marketing program for our FDA approved products. In July 2002, management implemented a cost reduction plan and deferred the implementation of the diabetic clinical trial, as well as, reduced production of product for commercial sales, which resulted in significant reductions in personnel costs in the second half of 2002.  Consulting. These fees decreased by $.9 million from $1.4 million in 2001 to $.5 million in 2002. This was due to the increased costs in 2001 related to the specific requirements for concluding the clinical trials for donor site wounds and FDA submissions, noted above, as well as, the costs of conducting the pilot clinical trials for venous leg stasis and diabetic foot ulcers. In 2002, only the costs of beginning the pivotal clinical trials for venous leg stasis ulcers were incurred.  General and Administrative. These expenses increased by $.1 million from $2.7 million in 2001 to $2.8 million in 2002. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to increased marketing expenses incurred early in the year, as we prepared for commercial sales of our product. As noted above, the decision to reduce fresh OrCel production in the third quarter resulted in a curtailment of marketing expense in the second half of the year. In 2002, we also incurred                                          16         higher expenses, as we continued our intense financing efforts. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of travel expenses in 2002, as we focused on reducing our overall spending.  Rent. This expense increased by $.1 million in 2002 compared with 2001, primarily due to the charges incurred for the New Jersey leases in 2002, which expense was not incurred in 2001.  Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $6.7 million, from $.5 million in 2001 to $7.2 million in 2002. This increase was due to the imputed non-cash interest resulting from the convertible debenture and convertible preferred financings, which occurred in 2002. Interest of $3.6 million was recorded as a result of these financings, $.2 million in coupon rate interest on the debentures and $3.4 million recorded as the fair market value of the conversion features and warrants issued with the financings. Additionally, non-cash interest of $3.5 million was accrued in 2002, relating to the Paul Capital Royalty obligation, as compared to $.5 million in 2001.  Interest Income. Interest income declined by approximately $.2 million in 2002, compared with 2001, primarily due to the smaller average cash balances outstanding during 2002 compared with 2001.  Loss on extinguishment of debt and series A preferred shares. We incurred a loss of $1.0 million due to the conversion of debt into preferred shares in 2002.  Year Ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000.  Revenues  Ortec made its first commercial shipments of products to customers in December 2001, earning revenues from operations of approximately $22,000.  Expenses  Expenses increased by approximately $3.4 million in 2001 from approximately $12.7 million in 2000 to approximately $16.1 million in 2001.  Personnel. Personnel costs increased by approximately $1.8 million to $6.6 million in 2001, compared with $4.8 million in 2000. This increased expense resulted from the additional personnel required to conduct and manage the clinical trial programs, to manufacture the product required by our clinical trial programs and other research and development activities, to prepare for manufacturing scale-up and marketing and an increase in corporate and administrative expenses. During 2001, we conducted two pilot clinical trials, concluded a pivotal clinical trial and the relevant FDA submissions. Based on these trials and submissions, Ortec was granted two FDA approvals in 2001.  Consulting. These fees increased by $.6 million from $.8 million in 2000 to $1.4 million in 2001, primarily due to costs incurred in conducting the clinical trials and FDA submissions, noted above, the development of a new cryopreserved product and in hiring a marketing consultant.                                          17          Research and Development. These expenses increased by approximately $.1 million to $4.3 million in 2001, compared with $4.2 million in 2000. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the costs of conducting the venous and diabetic ulcers clinical trials, as well as research work performed in the areas of cryopreservation and production cost reduction.  General and Administrative. These expenses increased by $.4 million from $2.3 million in 2000 to $2.7 million in 2001, due to increased marketing and legal expenses incurred, as Ortec prepares for commercial sales of its product and continues its financing activities. During 2001, the Company worked on and entered into several significant agreements, including the Paul Capital Revenue Interest Assignment agreement, the GE Capital Asset Financing agreement and the Technology Center of New Jersey Lease agreement. We also investigated and evaluated several potential corporate investment partners.  Interest Expense. Ortec incurred increased interest expense of $.4 million in 2001, compared with the expense incurred in 2000. On August 29, 2001, Ortec entered into a Royalty Revenue Interest Assignment agreement with Paul Capital and as part of this agreement, was entitled to receive $10.0 million in 2001. $6.0 million of this amount was received in 2001 and the remaining $4.0 million was received in January 2002. As of December 31, 2001, management anticipated that the effective cost of these funds based on the anticipated revenue stream, over the term of this agreement, which terminates in December 2011, may range between 20% to 35% per annum and as such, approximately $455,000 in interest expense had been accrued in 2001.  Interest Income. Interest income declined by approximately $395,000 from $587,000 in 2000 to approximately $192,000 in 2001, primarily due to the smaller average cash balances outstanding during 2001 compared with 2000.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Since inception (March 12, 1991) through December 31, 2002, we have accumulated a deficit of approximately $81.9 million and we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses through 2004. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our common stock, preferred stock and convertible debentures, our initial public offering and the exercise of our publicly traded Class A warrants at the end of 1997. From inception to December 31, 2002, we received cash proceeds from the sale of common equity securities, net of share issuance expenses, of approximately $49.0 million, we received net proceeds from the issuance of debentures and preferred stock of $8.2 million, and we have received a total of $10 million from the sale of a percentage interest in our future revenues from the sale of our product in North America.                                          18         Subsequent to December 31, 2002, the Company has continued with its convertible preferred stock financing and on February 26, 2003, closed on an additional $2.0 million investment in preferred equity.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, we used net cash for operating activities of approximately $10.9 million. Cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net loss of $21.6 million, offset by depreciation and amortization of approximately $715,000, approximately $6.9 million of non-cash interest expense, a loss on extinguishment of debt on series A preferred stock of $1.0 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $1.4 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2002 we invested approximately $192,000 in property, plant, equipment and patent application costs. In January 2002, we received a $1,300,000 line of credit from GE Capital for equipment lease financing, with which we financed $450,000 of additional purchases of fixed assets. This line of credit was available for eligible manufacturing equipment purchases in 2002.  We repaid $246,000 of our loans payable and long-term debt during the year ended December 31, 2002. We received $4.0 million under our agreement with Paul Capital Royalty Acquisition Fund, L.P. and $8.2 million from issuance of our convertible debentures, notes and preferred stock financing through H.C. Wainwright, as noted above. As a result of the aforementioned preferred stock financing, common shares outstanding increased by 13.5 million shares, due to the conversion of warrants granted and the issuance of common stock dividends.  In December 2001, we entered into a ten-year lease with New Jersey Economic Development Authority ("NJEDA") to lease approximately 58,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space located in North Brunswick, New Jersey. On August 5, 2002, we reached an agreement with NJEDA to terminate the December 2001 lease and enter into a new lease for approximately 26,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space. The new lease began on August 1, 2002 and terminates on December 31, 2005, with rental payments beginning in January 2003. A security deposit of $623,000, which was paid by us on the original lease, has been applied as a security deposit on the new lease. All construction costs advanced by NJEDA for the renovation of the premises, approximately $420,000, has been included as a construction allowance in the new lease and is reflected in the rent base. Due to the lower level of financing received in 2002 than had originally been planned, the Company is currently engaged in discussions with the NJEDA to defer or terminate the lease entered into in August 2002. In the event that we reach an agreement with the NJEDA to terminate the lease, the security deposit of $623,000 may be partially or wholly utilized as part of the termination settlement.  Under the August 29, 2001 agreement, as amended, in consideration for the investment of $10.0 million, Paul Capital received 3-1/3% of end user revenues from the sale of our products in the United States, Canada and Mexico. These percentage payments may be further adjusted upward or downward, based on the volume of net sales to end users of our products in                                          19         those three countries. As of December 31, 2002, we have provided for the effective cost of the amounts received from Paul Capital at 30% per annum, pursuant to default provisions of the agreement and we have accrued interest accordingly. However, at such time when the default provisions are no longer applicable, interest will be accrued based upon the expected level of future revenues, which may result in a lower imputed interest rate, with potential material financial impact. Under the August 29, 2001 agreement, as amended, beginning on January 1, 2003, Paul Capital will be entitled to receive each year advances from the first proceeds to us from end user sales of our products. The agreement provides for quarterly and annual accountings between Paul Capital and us for those advance payments, compared to amounts owed based on actual sales. Such annual amounts Paul Capital will be able to draw in advance will range from $.6 million in 2003, $1.0 million in 2004 to $7.5 million in 2005 and thereafter.  At December 31, 2002, our liabilities exceeded the value of our assets and as such, we were technically in default of the solvency requirement under the Paul Capital agreement. Paul Capital is aware of this breech and based on our discussions regarding this issue, has indicated to us that it presently does not intend to exercise its option to require us to repurchase its revenue interest. Additionally, in February 2003, Paul Capital amended its agreement with us, restating and updating certain provisions of the original agreement. On February 26, 2003, Paul Capital invested an additional $500,000 in our Series B preferred stock, in concurrence with this amendment.  In the event of a change in control of Ortec or upon the occurrence of certain other events as defined in the agreement, Paul Capital has the option to put its revenue interest back to us for an amount as provided in the agreement. Ortec also has the option to repurchase Paul Capital's interest upon the occurrence of a change in control of Ortec or a complete divestiture by us of our products, for an amount provided in the agreement.  We have granted Paul Capital a security interest in all our United States patents and trademarks relating to our technology for our product, to secure payments we are required to make to Paul Capital, based on sales generated under the Royalty Revenue Interest Assignment agreement, as described above.  The original agreement and modifications to the agreement terminate on December 31, 2011, unless terminated earlier by either party, as permitted by the terms of the agreement.  On March 27, 2002, we engaged H.C. Wainwright & Co., Inc. an investment banking firm, to act as our financial advisor in connection with raising capital for the Company through debt and/or equity financing. Wainwright has assisted us in raising financing of approximately $8.2 million in 2002 and has continued its financing efforts on our behalf in 2003. On May 13, 2002, we secured the first $2.3 million of this financing, in the form of 12% convertible debentures, which was convertible into common shares. On June 28, 2002, $0.6 million of these debentures were converted into Series-A convertible preferred stock. We also issued 291,000 warrants to purchase common stock as part of this May 13, 2002 financing. On June 28, 2002, an additional $1.5 million of financing was secured, which consisted of $1.2 million in Series A convertible preferred stock and $.3 million in 12% convertible debentures. We also issued 655,000 stock purchase warrants as part of the June 28, 2002 financing. In the third and                                          20         fourth quarters of 2002, we raised an additional $3.3 million in convertible debentures and $1.1 million in convertible preferred stock.  On November 13 and December 13, 2002, the investors converted all their outstanding convertible debentures and Series-A convertible preferred stock into Series-B convertible preferred stock, thereby acquiring 938.2742 shares of preferred shares, at a stated value of $9,382,742. In addition, these investors were granted Series A warrants, to purchase 9,382,742 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $.001. These Series-A warrants vested immediately and were exercised immediately, upon grant. The investors were also granted Series B-1 and Series B-2 warrants, which can be used to purchase 5,429,891 and 4,691,386 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 and $2.00 per share, respectively. The Series B-1 and B-2 warrants are exercisable nine and twelve months, respectively, after issue. The warrants previously granted with the issuance of the convertible debentures and Series-A preferred stock, were exchanged for Series B-1 warrants. In conjunction with this preferred stock financing, the investors were also paid a common stock dividend, whereby they were granted 3,753,116 shares of common stock.  The Series B preferred stock is convertible into common shares at any time at the option of the investor, based on a fixed conversion rate of $1.00 or commencing after February 1, 2003, based on an alternative conversion rate equal to 90% of the average of the five lowest volume weighted average prices for the common stock for the twenty trading days immediately prior to conversion, subject to a floor price of $0.25. The fixed conversion rate may be adjusted downward if the Company subsequently issues common stock at a purchase price less than $0.50. In that event, the fixed conversion rate will be adjusted downward to the price of the new issuance. Conversion is mandatory, upon the occurrence of certain financial events, such as, beginning six months from the date of issue, if the closing bid price of common shares exceeds $2.00 for a period of 20 consecutive trading days, or if within nine months from the date of issue, the Company completes a public offering, raising a minimum of $8 million. The alternative conversion price is adjustable or cancelable under certain circumstances, such as, in the event that the Company receives a licensing fee and/or a strategic investment of at least $5.0 million, within six months of closing, the alternative conversion rate is adjusted to the common share price of the investment or is cancelled if the share price exceeds the fixed rate of $1.00. If within six months from date of issue, the Company receives a licensing fee with an upfront payment of at least $5.0 million, the alternative conversion rate is adjusted to the quoted closing stock price on the day of the public announcement or is cancelled if this closing price exceeds $1.00. Similarly, if the Company completes a subsequent public or private financing of a least $5.0 million, within six months of closing, the alternative conversion rate is adjusted to the closing price or the fixed rate of $l.00, if lower. Dividends were paid in advance in common shares at the rate of 12% in the first year after issue and will be paid semiannually in subsequent years, in either cash or common shares, at the election of the Company, until at such time as the preferred stock is converted to common shares. Along with the convertible preferred stock, the Company also issued warrants to purchase common shares, as noted above. The Series B-1 and B-2 warrants are redeemable by the Company at $0.10 per share, twelve months and twenty-four months after issuance, respectively, if the Company's common shares closes above $3.00 and $4.00, respectively, for 15 consecutive trading days.                                          21         Our capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the progress and magnitude of our research and development programs, pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, the time involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale of our product to treat venous stasis and diabetic foot ulcers, the cost involved in filing and maintaining patent claims, technological advances, competitive and market conditions, our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements, our cost of manufacturing scale up and the cost and effectiveness of commercialization activities and arrangements.  We have raised funds in the past through the public or private sale of equity securities and debentures and through the agreement with Paul Capital. We will need to raise additional funds in the future through public or private financings, collaborative arrangements or from other sources. The success of such efforts will depend in large part upon continuing developments in our clinical trials and upon market conditions.  We require substantial funding to continue our research and development activities, clinical trials, manufacturing, sales, distribution and administrative activities. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2002, (approximately $0.8 million) and the financing of $2.0 million received in February 2003, will enable us to continue our operations until May 31, 2003. We are continuing our equity financing efforts with H.C. Wainwright and we expect to raise an additional $5.0 million from investors, some of whom have previously participated in the $10.2 million raised to date. This will enable us to complete our venous clinical pivotal trial, file our PMA with the FDA and execute on our plan to engage the services of a third party manufacturer. Accomplishing these milestones will also enable us to raise an additional $5.0 million in 2003 through other potential collaborative arrangements with companies for sales, marketing and distribution of our product and through other equity investments. Based on these efforts, management believes that the Company will be able to continue its operations for at least the next 12 months.  We continue to explore and, as appropriate, enter into discussions with other companies regarding the potential for equity investment, collaborative arrangements, license agreements or other funding programs with us, in exchange for manufacturing, marketing, distribution or other rights to our product. However, we can give no assurance that discussions with other companies will result in any additional investments, collaborative arrangements, agreements or other funding, or that the necessary additional financing through debt or equity financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Further, we can give no assurance that any arrangements resulting from these discussions will successfully reduce our funding requirements. If additional funding is not available to us when needed, we may not be able to continue operations.                                          22         Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
