Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto. This discussion may be deemed to include forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risk and uncertainty, including financial, clinical, business environment and trend projections. Although Ortec International, Inc. believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved. The important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include, without limitation, the early stage of development of both the Company and its product, the timing and uncertainty of results of both research and regulatory processes, the extensive government regulation applicable to the Company's business, the unproven safety and efficacy of the Company's product, the Company's significant additional financing requirements, the uncertainty of future capital funding, the existence and future development of competing technologies, the presence of a number of competitors with significantly greater financial, technical and other resources and extensive operating histories, the Company's potential exposure to product liability, uncertainties relating to patents and other intellectual property, including whether the Company will obtain sufficient protection or competitive advantage therefrom, and other factors detailed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998.  General        Since its inception the Company has been principally engaged in the research and development of its skin regeneration product for use in the treatment of chronic and acute wounds, such as venous and diabetic skin ulcers, burns, donor site wounds and chronic skin ulcers in Epidermolysis Bullosa ("EB") patients. The Company has not had any revenues                                          15    18  from operations since its founding in 1991 since the Company cannot make any sales of its product until it receives approval from the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") to do so. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately $21.1 million as of December 31, 1998. The Company expects to continue to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years due to continued and increased spending on research and development programs, the funding of preclinical and clinical testing and trials and regulatory activities and the costs of manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution and administrative activities.        The Company's revenues consist only of interest income. To date, the Company has received no revenue from the sale of its product, and the Company is not permitted to engage in commercial sales of its product until such time, if ever, as the Company receives requisite FDA and/or other foreign regulatory approvals. As a result, the Company does not expect to record significant product sales until such approvals are received.        The Company anticipates that future revenues and results of operations may continue to fluctuate significantly depending on, among other factors, the timing and outcome of applications for regulatory approvals, the Company's ability to successfully manufacture, market and distribute its product and/or the establishment of collaborative arrangements for the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of its product. The Company anticipates its operating activities will result in substantial net losses for several years more.        The Company is currently conducting clinical trials of its product in the treatment of autograft donor site wounds, chronic ulcers in patients with EB, venous stasis ulcers and partial thickness burns, and is proceeding to secure FDA approval to conduct a clinical trial to use its product in the treatment of diabetic ulcers.  Year 2000        The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year. The Company's computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are time-sensitive, may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations, including, among other things, a temporary inability to process accounting, payroll, database, network, and software transactions, possible disruption of environmental, lighting, and security controls, possible disruption of copier and fax capabilities, and loss of telephone voicemail messages, in addition to other similar normal business activities.        The Company plans to install a new network computer system that will be Year 2000 compliant. Utilizing both internal and external resources to identify and assess needed Year 2000 remediation, the Company currently anticipates that its Year 2000 identification, assessment, remediation and testing efforts will be completed in 1999.                                          16    19  Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 1998 to Year ended December 31, 1997        Revenues. The Company has had no revenues from operations other than interest income from its inception in 1991 to date. Interest income increased by approximately $282,000 from approximately $291,000 in 1997 to approximately $573,000 in 1998 because of larger cash and marketable securities balances in 1998 that resulted from sale of common stock        Research and Development. The Company's research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased to $1.9 million from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997, which amounts do not include consulting expenses, a significant portion of which was paid for the Company's research and development. Such consulting expenses for research and development amounted to approximately $684,000 in 1998 as opposed to approximately $355,000 in 1997. The increase in research and development expenses relates primarily to the costs associated with the increase in clinical trial activity, cryopreservation research and for enhancement and other applications of the Company's product. In addition, research and development expenses continue to increase in conjunction with the Company's progression through the various stages of preclinical and clinical trials and the increased costs associated with the purchase of raw materials and supplies for the production of the Company's product used in those trials. Future research and development expenses may increase depending on the continued expenses incurred in clinical trials and the costs associated with the Company's manufacturing scale-up and the expansion of its research and development programs, which includes the increased hiring of personnel and continued expansion of preclinical and clinical testing.        General and Administrative. The Company's general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased to $1.7 million from $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the same period in 1997 are a result of (i) the increase in costs associated with professional services received from financial consultants, attorneys and accountants and (ii) the increased overhead costs resulting from the increase in personnel. Future general and administrative expenses may increase as additional personnel are employed, there are increases in corporate development, use of professional services, compensation expense associated with stock options, use of financial consultants and other general corporate matters.        Personnel. The Company's personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased to $4.1 million from $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. This increase resulted from the larger number of persons employed by the Company because of its increased research and development, including the conducting of and preparation for clinical trials, and for which additional personnel were also required in administrative positions. Approximately $1.3 million of that increase was attributable to the non cash                                          17    20  expense consisting of grants of stock options and warrants. Future personnel costs are expected to increase since the Company intends to expand its clinical trial program for the use of its product in treating different medical indications, possible increase in its other research and development activities, compensation expense associated with the grant of stock options and for corporate administrative personnel.        Rent. The Company's expenses for rent for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased to $252,000 from $166,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase in rent expense in 1998 as compared to 1997 is the result of the Company increasing the amount of space occupied by it at Columbia University's Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park in New York City for additional laboratories built for the Company's research and development, and to accommodate the additional personnel employed by the Company in 1998. Future rent expense is expected to increase since the rent expense figure for 1998 reflects rent paid for the Company's additional space for only a portion of that year.  Year ended December 31, 1997 to Year Ended December 31, 1996        Revenues. As noted above, the Company has no revenues from operations other than interest income. Interest income increased approximately $120,000 from approximately $170,000 in 1996 to approximately $290,000 in 1997 because of larger average cash and marketable securities balances in 1997 that resulted from the sale of common stock.        Research and Development. The Company's research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased to approximately $1.2 million from approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, which amounts do not include consulting expenses, a significant portion of which was paid for the Company's research and development. Such consulting expenses for research and development amounted to approximately $355,000 in 1997 as opposed to approximately $262,000 in 1996. The increase in research and development expenses related primarily to the costs associated with the increase in clinical trial activity, cryopreservation research and validating that the Company's new laboratory facilities meet FDA guidelines so that such laboratories could be used to produce the Company's product for use in clinical trials.        General and Administrative. The Company's general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased to approximately $1.3 million from approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the same period in 1996 was the result of (i) the increase in costs associated with professional services received from financial consultants, attorneys and accountants and (ii) the increased overhead costs resulting from the increase in personnel.        Personnel. The Company's personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased to approximately $1.9 million from approximately $0.7 million for the year                                          18    21  ended December 31, 1996. This increase resulted from the larger number of persons employed by the Company because of its increased research and development, including the conducting and preparation for clinical trials, and for which additional personnel were required in administrative positions. Approximately $0.5 million of that increase was attributable to the non cash expense consisting of grants of stock options and warrants.        Rent. The Company's expenses for rent for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased to $166,000 from $85,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase in rent expense in 1997 as compared to 1996 was the result of the Company occupying its office and laboratory facility at Columbia University's Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park in New York City for a full year in 1997 and for only part of the year in 1996.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Since inception (March 12, 1991) through December 31, 1998, the Company has accumulated a deficit of approximately $21.1 million and expects to continue to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the next several years. The Company has financed its operations primarily through private placements of its Common Stock, its initial public offering and the exercise of its publicly traded Class A warrants at the end of 1997. As of December 31, 1998 the Company had received proceeds from the sale of equity securities of approximately $31.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 1998 the Company used net cash for operating activities of approximately $5.0 million compared to approximately $5.5 million for the same period in 1997. The decrease in cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from (i) a net cash outlay in 1997 of approximately $1.5 million which the Company used to purchase marketable securities with cash it had on hand, as opposed to net cash received of approximately $0.8 million from the sale of marketable securities in 1998 (ii) an increase of approximately $1.3 million attributable to non cash expense consisting of grants of stock options and warrants ($1.9 million in 1998 and $0.6 million in 1997) and (iii) increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and depreciation and amortization. In the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company used net cash for operating activities of $2.2 million. The increase in net cash used in operating activities in 1997 as opposed to 1996 resulted primarily from a net loss in 1997 that was approximately $2.2 million greater than the net loss in 1996. In the future the amount of cash needed for operating activities is expected to increase primarily due to an increase in operating activities associated with the continued expansion of preclinical testing and clinical trials, the increase in research and development programs and personnel and the increase in general corporate activities.        In the year ended December 31, 1998 the Company realized cash provided by its financing activities of approximately $6.1 million as compared to cash provided by its financing activities of $8.0 million in 1997. The lesser amount of cash received from financing activities is accounted for by the larger amount of net proceeds received by the Company from issuance of Common Stock in 1997 ($7.8 million) than in 1998 ($5.7 million;                                          19    22 of which $2.4 million were proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock at the end of 1997 which were received by the Company at the beginning of 1998) and modest increases of amounts in the repayment of capital lease obligations, repayment of notes payable and for the purchase by the Company of its own Common Stock, offset by an increase in proceeds from loans of $600,000 in 1998 compared to $325,850 in 1997. In the year ended December 31, 1996 the Company realized net cash from its financing activities of approximately $10.6 million, much of which was the proceeds from the initial public offering of its securities and the remainder from sales of its common stock in a private placement offering.        The Company invested a total of approximately $1.1 million in property, plant and equipment during 1998 compared to approximately $300,000 during 1997. The increase is directly related to costs incurred for the expansion of the Company's laboratory and office space as well as the purchase of equipment for this space. In the year ended December 31, 1996 the Company invested $884,093 in building its then new laboratory and office at the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park in New York City and an aggregate of $63,000 for patent applications and a deposit. The Company expects to continue to purchase property and equipment in the future as it expands its preclinical, clinical and research and development activities. Since inception, the Company has entered into capital lease agreements for approximately $118,900 of equipment, consisting primarily of laboratory equipment. The Company expects to continue to lease equipment from time to time as needed, when and if financing resources become available at acceptable terms to the Company.        The Company's capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the progress and magnitude of the Company's research and development programs and preclinical testing and clinical trials, the time involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, the cost involved in filing and maintaining patent claims, technological advances, competitor and market conditions, the ability of the Company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements, the cost of manufacturing scale-up and the cost and effectiveness of commercialization activities and arrangements.        The Company is likely to require substantial funding to continue its research and development activities, preclinical testing and clinical trials and manufacturing scale up, marketing, sales, distribution, and administrative activities. The Company has raised funds in the past through the public or private sale of securities, and may raise funds in the future through public or private financings, collaborative arrangements or from other sources. The success of such efforts will depend in large part upon continuing developments in the Company's clinical trials. The Company continues to explore and, as appropriate, enter into discussions with other companies regarding the potential for equity investment, collaborative arrangements, license agreements or development or other funding programs with the Company in exchange for manufacturing, marketing, distribution or other rights to the Company's product. However, there can be no assurance that discussions with other companies will result in any investments, collaborative arrangements, agreements or funding, or that the necessary additional financing through debt or equity financing will be available                                          20    23  to the Company on acceptable terms, if at all. Further, there can be no assurance that any arrangements resulting from these discussions will successfully reduce the Company's funding requirements. If additional funding is not available to the Company when needed, the Company will be required to scale back its research and development programs, preclinical testing and clinical trials and administrative activities and the Company's business and financial results and condition would be materially adversely affected.
