Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS        The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto. This discussion may be deemed to include forward looking statements.  General        Since Ortec's inception we have been principally engaged in the research and development of our skin regeneration product for use in the treatment of chronic and acute wounds, such as venous and diabetic skin ulcers, indeterminate depth burns and autograft donor site wounds. We have not had any revenues from operations since Ortec's inception in 1991 because we cannot make any sales of our product until we receive approval from the FDA to do so. We have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately $43.3 million as of December 31, 2000. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses until at least 2003 due to continued spending on research and development programs, the funding of clinical trials and regulatory activities and the costs of manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution and administrative activities.        Our revenues consist only of interest income. To date, we have received no revenue from the sale of our Composite Cultured Skin. While we may make commercial sales of our product for use in surgeries on patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, which has a small patient population, we are not permitted to engage in commercial sales of our product for treatment of skin wounds with larger patient populations, until such time, if ever, as we receive requisite FDA and/or other foreign regulatory approvals for such sales. As a result, we do not expect to record significant product sales until such approvals are received.        We anticipate that future revenues and results of operations may continue to fluctuate significantly depending on, among other factors, the timing and outcome of applications for regulatory approvals, our ability to successfully manufacture, market and distribute our product and/or the establishment of collaborative arrangements for the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our product. We anticipate that our operating activities will result in substantial net losses until at least 2003.        We are currently conducting or have completed clinical trials of our Composite Cultured Skin in the treatment of autograft donor site wounds, venous and diabetic ulcers and chronic ulcers resulting from epidermolysis bullosa.                                          17        Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2000 to Year Ended December 31, 1999        Revenues. Interest income increased by approximately $218,000 from approximately $369,000 in 1999 to approximately $587,000 in 2000 because of larger cash and cash equivalent balances in 2000 that resulted from sale of common stock.        Research and Development. Our research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased to $4.2 million from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, which amounts do not include consulting expenses, a significant portion of which we paid for research and development. Such consulting expenses for research and development amounted to approximately $838,000 in 2000 and approximately $834,000 in 1999. The increase in research and development expenses relates primarily to the costs associated with the increase in clinical trial activity, cryopreservation research and for enhancement and other applications of our Composite Culture Skin.        General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 amounted to $2.3 million and $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.        Personnel. Our personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased to $4.8 million from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase resulted from the larger number of persons we employed because of our increased research for product development, to conduct our clinical trials, to prepare for manufacturing scale up and for marketing of our CCS, and for additional personnel required in administrative positions because of such increased staff.        Rent. Our expenses for rent for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased to $535,000 from $473,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in rent expense in 2000 as compared to 1999 is the result of the increase in the amount of space we occupied at Columbia University's Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park in New York City for additional laboratories we built for research and development, and to accommodate the additional personnel we employed in 2000.  Year Ended December 31, 1999 to Year Ended December 31, 1998        Revenues. Interest income decreased approximately $204,000 from approximately $573,000 in 1998 to approximately $369,000 in 1999 because of lower average cash and marketable securities balances in 1999 that resulted from the sale of common stock.        Research and Development. Our research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased to approximately $3.1 million from approximately $1.9 million                                          18        for the year ended December 31, 1998, which amounts do not include consulting expenses, a significant portion of which we paid for research and development. Such consulting expenses for research and development amounted to approximately $834,000 in 1999 as compared to approximately $908,000 in 1998. The increase in research and development expenses related primarily to the costs associated with the increase in clinical trial activity, cryopreservation research and for enhancement and other applications of our Composite Cultured Skin.        General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased to approximately $2.2 million from approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the same period in 1998 was the result of (i) the increase in costs associated with professional services received from financial consultants, attorneys and accountants and (ii) the increased overhead costs resulting from the increase in personnel.        Personnel. Our personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 decreased to approximately $3.7 million from approximately $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Cash compensation paid by us to our personnel actually increased $1.6 million from $2.1 million in 1998 to $3.7 million in 1999, but non-cash compensation in the form of stock options decreased from $1.9 million in 1998 to $64,715 in 1999. The increased cash compensation in 1999 compared to 1998 resulted from the larger number of persons we employed because of our increased research and development, including the conducting and preparation for clinical trials, and for which additional personnel were required in administrative positions.        Rent. Our expenses for rent for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased to $473,000 from $252,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase in rent expense in 1999 as compared to 1998 was the result of new office and laboratory space we rented at Columbia University's Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park in New York City for a full year in 1999 and for only part of the year in 1998.  Liquidity and Capital Resources        Since inception (March 12, 1991) through December 31, 2000, we have accumulated a deficit of approximately $43.3 million and we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the next two years. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our common stock, our initial public offering and the exercise of our publicly traded Class A warrants at the end of 1997. From inception to December 31, 2000 we have received proceeds from the sale of equity securities, net of share issuance expenses, of approximately $49.9 million.                                          19              In 2000 we used net cash for operating activities of approximately $11.6 million. Cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net loss of $12.1 million offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization.        In 2000 we realized cash provided by our financing activities of approximately $9.0 million. We received approximately $9.1 million in 2000 from sale of our common stock net of share issuance costs which was offset by payments of $127,000 on capital leases and $35,000 for purchases of treasury stock        We invested a total of approximately $641,000 consisting of $552,000 for property, plant and equipment and $90,000 for patents. Since inception, we have spent approximately $3.9 million for property, plant and equipment, excluding capital lease agreements, and approximately $732,000 for patents. The capital lease agreements consist primarily of laboratory equipment.        Our capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the progress and magnitude of our research and development programs and our clinical trials, the time involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for the use of our Composite Cultured Skin for the treatment of skin wounds with large patient populations, the cost involved in filing and maintaining patent claims, technological advances, competitor and market conditions, our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements, the cost of manufacturing scale-up and the cost and effectiveness of commercialization activities and arrangements.        We have raised funds in the past through the public and private sale of securities, and may raise funds in the future through public or private financings, collaborative arrangements or from other sources. The success of such efforts will depend in large part upon continuing developments in our clinical trials. We continue to explore and, as appropriate, enter into discussions with other companies regarding the potential for equity investment, collaborative arrangements, license agreements or development or other funding programs in exchange for marketing, distribution or other rights to our Composite Cultured Skin. However, such discussions with other companies may not result in any investments, collaborative arrangements, agreements or funding, and the necessary additional financing through debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, any arrangements resulting from these discussions may not reduce our funding requirements. If we cannot secure additional funding when needed, we will be required to scale back our research and development programs, clinical trials and administrative activities and our business and financial results and condition would be materially adversely affected. At our current rate of spending, our cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2000 (approximately $9.3 million) will enable us to continue our operations through the end of 2001.                                          20        Item 8.
