Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Certain statements in this discussion constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company or industry to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Overview  The Company is the largest owner/manager of manufactured home communities in the United States, based both on the number of communities and the number of residential homesites owned. The Company added 89 manufactured home communities to its portfolio over the three-year period ended December 31, 1997. At the end of this period, the Company's portfolio was comprised of 131 manufactured home communities containing 43,800 homesites in 28 states.  A substantial portion of the Company's growth since the beginning of 1995 can be attributed to the Company's Merger with ROC on February 11, 1997. The historical results of the Company in 1997 include the results of operations of ROC since February 1, 1997. In addition, as a result of the Merger, the Company acquired ROC's third-party property management operations and its taxable sales and brokerage subsidiary, CSI.  Company growth since the beginning of 1995 can also be attributed to increased operating results at existing communities, community expansions, new community development and additional acquisition activities.  Since its organization, the Company has elected to qualify as a REIT under the Code and thus does not generally pay federal corporate income taxes on its earnings to the extent that such earnings are distributed to shareholders.  The Company conducts substantially all of its activities through the Operating Partnership in which it owned a combined 90 percent general partner interest as of December 31, 1997.  Historical Results of Operations  Comparison of the year ended December 31, 1997 to the year ended December 31, 1996  For the year ended December 31, 1997, income before minority interest was $24,688,000, an increase of $8,588,000 from the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase was due primarily to the Merger, as well as acquisitions that were consummated in 1997 and 1996 by the Company or ROC, and increased net operating income from communities owned by the Company and ROC at the beginning of the period (the "Core 1996 Portfolio"). The increase in net operating income from the Company's Core 1996 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and rental increases partially offset by general operating expense increases.                                           18    19  Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $134,801,000, an increase of $67,568,000 from 1996. Approximately 80 percent of the increase was due to the Merger, and 9 percent was due to 1997 and 1996 acquisitions made by the Company or ROC. The remaining 11 percent increase was due to rental increases and occupancy gains in the Company's Core 1996 Portfolio.  Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1997 was 38,053 sites compared with 18,889 sites for the same period in 1996. During 1997, the Company increased occupancy by nearly 400 sites, primarily in its active expansion communities. The occupancy rate for the total portfolio was 92.0 percent on approximately 43,800 sites as of December 31, 1997, compared to 94.4 percent on approximately 20,279 sites as of December 31, 1996. The decrease in the occupancy rate is due to the increase in available sites added through expansions of existing communities. The occupancy rate on the stabilized portfolio was 93.6 percent as of December 31, 1997. On a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $287, which is consistent with the same period of 1996. For the Company's Core 1996 Portfolio, on a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $289 compared with $278 for the same period in 1996, an increase of 4.1 percent.  Management fee, interest and other income primarily include management fee income for the management of 32 manufactured home communities, equity earnings from the Company's sales subsidiary, CSI, and interest income on notes receivable. The increase in 1997 from 1996 is due primarily to business activities acquired in conjunction with the Merger.  Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased by $20,945,000 or 115 percent from the same period a year ago. The majority of the increase was due to the Merger and 1997 and 1996 acquisitions. The remaining increase was due to increases in the Company's Core 1996 Portfolio. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance expense increased 6.8 percent from approximately $80 in 1996 to approximately $86 in 1997. A portion of this increase is due to the operating expenses related to the properties managed by the Company for a management fee beginning in 1997.  Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased by $5,090,000 or 105 percent from the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase is due primarily to the Merger, acquisitions and expansions of communities and general increases. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $21.78 in 1997 compared to $21.42 in 1996, an increase of 1.7 percent. Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased due to the Merger. Administrative expense in 1997 was 5.0 percent of total revenues as compared to 5.7 percent in 1996.  Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December 31, 1997 by $12,956,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase is attributable to the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger and to finance the 1997 and 1996 acquisitions. Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding decreased to approximately 7.7 percent in 1997 from approximately 8.1 percent in 1996. The decrease is due primarily to the ROC debt assumed in the Merger having a lower average interest rate as well as much of the financing in connection with the Merger and the 1997 and 1996 acquisitions being done with the Company's lines of credit which had a lower average interest rate. In addition, in July 1997, the Company renegotiated its lines of credit into a new line with a lower borrowing rate of 110 basis points over LIBOR versus 150 basis points over LIBOR on the old lines.                                           19    20  Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1997, increased $20.1 million from the same period a year ago. The increase is directly attributable to the Merger and acquisitions. Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in 1997 remained relatively unchanged from 1996.  Comparison of year ended December 31, 1996 to year ended December 31, 1995  For the year ended December 31, 1996, income before majority interest and extraordinary item was $16,100,000, an increase of $2,121,000 from the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase was due primarily to increased net operating income from communities owned by the Company on January 1, 1995 (the "Core 1995 Portfolio") and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of three communities in 1996 and one community in 1995. The increase in net operating income from the Company's Core 1995 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and rental increases offset by general operating expense increases.  Rental revenue in 1996 was $67,233,000, an increase of $5,675,000 or 9.2 percent from 1995. Approximately 2.3 percent of the increase was due to the acquisitions of three communities in 1996 and one in 1995; 3.9 percent represented the effect of annual rent increases in the Core 1995 Portfolio; 1.8 percent was due to increased occupancy in the Core 1995 Portfolio and 1 percent was due to an increase in amenity income. Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1996, was 18,889 sites, or 4.6 percent higher than weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1995. Weighted average occupancy increased in 1996 due to the 1996 and 1995 acquisitions and the filling of 265 additional sites that were either vacant at January 1, 1996 or developed in 1996. The occupancy rate was 94.4 percent on 20,279 sites as of December 31, 1996, as compared with 94.3 percent on 19,594 sites as of December 31, 1995. On a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased to $285 from $277 in 1995 or 3.2 percent due to rental increases in the Core 1995 Portfolio in 1996.  The increase in amenity income of approximately $600,000 was due primarily to the inclusion of the results of operations of four golf courses and a marina for the period beginning January 1, 1996. These operations were previously conducted by GC Properties, Inc. ("GCI"), a corporation wholly owned by an equity owner of the Company, in order to permit the Company's qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. From November 23, 1993 through December 31, 1995, the Company recognized net lease income from GCI, which was classified as other income. In early 1996, the Company received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service allowing the Company to conduct these operations. Effective January 1, 1996, as a result of acquiring the operations of GCI, the Company has consolidated these operations.  Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased by $2,180,000 or 13.6 percent from the same period a year ago. Approximately $1,028,000 of the increase represents the operating costs of the golf course and marina operations discussed above. The remaining increase of $1,152,000 or a 7.2 percent increase over the prior year, is due primarily to the acquisition of three communities in 1996 and one in 1995. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance expense increased from $74 in 1995 to $80 in 1996, or 8.6 percent. Excluding the golf course and marina operations, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance expense increased 2.4 percent, on a per site basis, year over year.                                          20    21  Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1996, increased by $333,000, or 7.4 percent, from the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase is due primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities and general increases. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $21.40 in 1996 compared to $20.90 in 1995, an increase of 2.6 percent. Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Administrative expense for 1996 was relatively constant with 1995. Administrative expense in 1996 was 5.7 percent of revenues as compared to 6.3 percent in 1995.  Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December 31, 1996, by $510,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase is attributable to the indebtedness incurred to finance the 1996 acquisitions of three communities and one in 1995, as well as the investment in a joint venture with ROC that owns six development communities. Interest expense also increased due to the financing of the Company's repurchase and retirement of 450,000 shares of its common stock in connection with the Merger. Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding decreased to approximately 8.1 percent in 1996 from approximately 8.9 percent in 1995.  Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1996, increased $438,000 from the same period a year ago. The increase is due to acquisitions and expansions. Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in 1996 remained relatively unchanged from 1995.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Net cash provided by operating activities was $54,545,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997, compared to $29,755,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the increase in net operating income as a result of the Company's larger size.  Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1997, was $21,088,000. This amount includes net proceeds of $102 million received from the issuance of senior notes and proceeds of $25,477,000 from the issuance of 984,423 shares to certain OP Unitholders at the time of the Merger. Use of cash included distributions made to shareholders/OP Unitholders of $42,111,000; the payment of $19,851,000 to repurchase and retire 750,000 shares of the Company's common stock in connection with the Merger, and net payment on the line of credit of $45,834,000 with the proceeds from the senior notes. The shares purchased in 1997 and 1996 as a part of the program were purchased at an average price of approximately $25.75.                                          21    22  Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $61,309,000. This amount primarily represented the acquisition of four communities, payment of merger costs, joint venture investments, and advances to CSI, capital expenditures and construction and development costs. The acquisition of the four communities for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million was financed by $19.5 million borrowed on the Company's line of credit and $500,000 through the issuance of 16,480 OP Units. The Company invested approximately $4 million in cash in other joint ventures. The Company also advanced approximately $9 million to CSI. For the year ended December 31, 1997, construction and development costs approximated $8.1 million, while recurring property capital expenditures, other than construction and development costs, were approximately $3.7 million. Recurring property capital expenditures in 1997 increased significantly over the same period in 1996, due to the increased number of communities in the Company's portfolio. Capital expenditures have historically been financed with funds from operations and it is the Company's intention that such future expenditures will be financed with funds from operations.  In July 1997, the Company entered into two new credit facilities with the First National Bank of Chicago and other lenders, consisting of a $25 million term loan and a $75 million revolving line of credit (the "First Chicago Credit Facilities"). Effective July 1997, the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was reduced to LIBOR plus 110 basis points (from LIBOR plus 150 basis points). In addition, in September 1997, the Company secured a $7.5 million revolving line of credit from Colorado National Bank which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points (the "CNB Facility" and , together with the First Chicago Credit Facilities, the "Credit Facilities"). As of December 31, 1997, approximately $25 million was outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the Company had available $82.5 million in additional borrowing capacity.  On December 23, 1997, the Company issued 6.92% MandatOry Par Put Remarketed Securities(SM) ("MOPPRS(SM)" ) due December 10, 2014. The net proceeds to the Company from the issuance before deducting offering expenses, was approximately $102.0 million. The net proceeds from the MOPPRS(SM) were utilized primarily to reduce outstanding balances under the Credit Facilities and to finance acquisitions. The MOPPRS(SM) are rated as "BBB" by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and "Baa3" by Moody's Investors Service.  In connection with the issuance of the MOPPRS(SM), the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into a Remarketing Agreement, dated as of December 23, 1997 (the "Remarketing Agreement"), with the remarketing dealer named therein (the "Remarketing Dealer"), pursuant to which the MOPPRS(SM) are subject to mandatory tender in favor of the Remarketing Dealer on December 10, 2004 (the "Remarketing Date"), for a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the outstanding MOPPRS(SM). Upon the Remarketing Dealer's election to remarket the MOPPRS(SM), the interest rate to the December 10, 2014 maturity date of the MOPPRS will be adjusted to equal the sum of 5.75% plus the Applicable Spread (as defined in the Remarketing Agreement). In the event the Remarketing Dealer does not elect to remarket the MOPPRS(SM), the MOPPRS(SM) will mature on the Remarketing Date.  As of December 31, 1997, the Company had outstanding, in addition to the Credit Facilities and the MOPPRS(SM), $145 million of other unsecured senior debt with a weighted average interest rate and maturity of 8.2 percent and 4 years, respectively, and $114 million of secured mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate and maturity of 7.95 percent and 2.5 years, respectively.                                          22    23  Repayment of long-term borrowings and amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities, future acquisitions of communities and land for development and new community development activities represent the principal long-term liquidity need of the Company. The Company does not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to finance these long-term liquidity needs and instead intends to meet its long-term liquidity requirements through additional borrowing under the Credit Facilities or other lines of credit, the issuance of additional equity or debt securities and the assumption of existing secured or unsecured indebtedness.  The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including expansion activities and capital expenditure requirements, through cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under the Credit Facilities and other lines of credit.  In January 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of 16 properties, in Connecticut, South Carolina, and Florida, containing approximately 2,333 homesites and 1,359 park/model RV sites, for a total of approximately $55.4 million. These acquisitions were financed by $33.7 million in borrowings under the Company's line of credit, the issuance of 412,480 OP Units and $5.7 million in cash available from the proceeds of the December 1997 Debt Offering. Nine of the above communities, containing approximately 900 homesites and 1,100 park model/RV sites, are subject to long-term ground leases.  In February 1998, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $53.9 million from the issuance of 1,850,000 shares of its common stock. The proceeds from the offering were used to reduce outstanding balances under the Company's line of credit from the January 1998 acquisitions and for the March 1998 acquisitions.  In March 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of 6 properties, 1 in Michigan and 5 in Indiana, containing approximately 1,500 homesites, for a total of approximately $36.7 million. These acquisitions were financed by the issuance of common stock in February 1998 and by borrowings on the Company's line of credit. In addition, CSI purchased a 60 percent interest in three retail sales centers in Indiana, for approximately $1.2 million.  Inflation  All of the leases or terms of tenants' occupancies at the communities allow for at least annual rental adjustments. In addition, all leases are short-term (generally one year or less) and enable the Company to seek market rentals upon reletting the sites. Such leases generally minimize the risk to the Company of any adverse effect of inflation.  New Accounting Standards  In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share." This accounting standard specifies new computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share to be applied retroactively. Among other things, SFAS No. 128 requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the income statement.                                          23    24  Year 2000 Compliance  The Company is currently engaged in a review with its software vendors to ensure all systems are modified for year 2000 compliance. Since all systems are owned and maintained by third party vendors, the Company believes that the additional costs for compliance will not be material to future results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company.  Other  Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as consolidated net income of the Operating Partnership without giving effect to gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property and rental property depreciation and amortization. Management believes that FFO is an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of REITs, which provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. For all periods presented, depreciation of rental property and amortization of intangibles are the only non-cash adjustments. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO is calculated as follows:                                                                For the year                                                          ended December 31,                                                ---------------------------------                                                  1997         1996         1995                                                -------      -------      -------        Income before extraordinary item               $24,688      $16,100      $13,979 Depreciation of rental property                 30,867       11,360       10,919 Amortization of intangibles                        407           --           --                                                -------      -------      -------  Funds from operations                          $55,962      $27,460      $24,898                                                =======      =======      =======                                           24    25  Item 8.
