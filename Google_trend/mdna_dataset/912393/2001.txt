Item 7.   Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results - -------   --------------------------------------------------------------------- of Operations - -------------  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Certain statements in this discussion constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements may involve the Company's plans, objectives and expectations, which are dependent upon a number of factors, including site expansions, acquisitions, development and other new business initiatives which are all subject to a number of contingency factors such as the effects of national and local economic conditions, changes in interest rates, supply and demand for affordable housing and the condition of the capital markets that may prevent the Company from achieving its objectives.  Overview  The Company is one of the largest owner/managers of manufactured home communities in the United States. The Company added 8,500 manufactured home sites to its portfolio over the three-year period ended December 31, 2000. At the end of this period, the Company's portfolio comprised 166 manufactured home communities containing 52,347 manufactured homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites, located in 28 states.  The Company provides property management services to N'Tandem Trust ("N'Tandem") and other manufactured home community owners, with an aggregate of 9,200 homesites. In addition, the Company owns approximately ten percent of N'Tandem outstanding equity, has made loans to N'Tandem, and provides advisory services to N'Tandem.  Company growth since the beginning of 1998 can be attributed to community acquisitions, increased operating performance at existing communities, community expansions, and new community development. During 1998, the Company acquired 34 communities in four separate portfolio acquisitions, containing an aggregate of 7,045 manufactured homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites. During 1999 and 2000, the Company acquired two communities each year, containing a total of 1,034 sites (624 sites in 1999 and 410 sites in 2000).  Since its organization, the Company has elected to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and thus does not generally pay Federal corporate income taxes on its earnings to the extent that such earnings are distributed to shareholders.  The Company conducts substantially all of its activities through CP Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") in which it owned a combined 89 percent general partner interest as of December 31, 2000.  Historical Results of Operations  Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2000 to the year ended December 31, 1999  The following table summarizes certain information relative to the Company's properties, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999. The Company considers all communities owned by the Company as of January 1, 1999 as the "Core 1999 Portfolio".                                         16                                                             Core 1999 Portfolio                         Total Dollars in thousands, except per site                 2000              1999                2000               1999                                                     ---------         ---------           ---------          ---------          As of December 31, - -------------------------------------- Number of communities                                     161               161                 166                165 Total manufactured homesites                           51,325            51,042              52,347             51,659 Occupied sites                                         46,912            46,847              47,678             47,383 Occupancy %                                              91.4%             91.8%               91.1%              91.7%  For the year ended, December 31, - -------------------------------------- Rental income                                       $ 184,438         $ 176,872           $ 186,963          $ 177,789 Property operating expenses                         $  64,557         $  62,770           $  65,275          $  63,181 Net operating income                                $ 119,881         $ 114,102           $ 121,688          $ 114,608 Weighted average monthly rent per site              $     316         $     302           $     316          $     302   For the year ended December 31, 2000, income before minority interests was $48,722,000, an increase of $3,760,000 from the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase was due primarily to increased net operating income from the Core 1999 Portfolio and acquisitions. The increase in net operating income from the Company's Core 1999 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and rental increases partially offset by general operating expense increases. Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $186,963,000, an increase of $9,174,000 from 1999. Approximately 17 percent of the increase was due to acquisitions, net of dispositions, and 83 percent was due to rental increases and occupancy gains in the Company's Core 1999 Portfolio.  Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2000 was 47,466 sites compared with 47,181 sites for the same period in 1999. The occupancy rate for the total portfolio was 91.1 percent on 52,347 sites as of December 31, 2000, compared to 91.7 percent on 51,659 sites as of December 31, 1999. The occupancy rate on the stabilized portfolio (communities where the Company does not have or has not recently had, expansion of the community) was 92.5 percent as of December 31, 2000. The Company also added 275 available sites to its portfolio through expansion of its communities. On a per-site basis, weighted monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $316 compared with $302 for the same period in 1999.  Interest income primarily includes interest on notes receivable and advances to affiliates. The increase of $3,998,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 from the same period in 1999 is due primarily to increased interest income from Company-funded development projects, increased lending activity, as well as an increase in interest rates.  Management fee and other income primarily includes management fee and transaction fee income for the management of 44 manufactured home communities and equity earnings from CSI. Included in this amount is approximately $3.2 million of acquisition and transaction fees due to N'Tandem's acquisitions activity in 2000. Also included in management fee and other income is approximately $2.1 million of management and advisory fees from the N'Tandem properties. The Company expects to continue to earn management, advisory and other fees from N'Tandem in 2001, and estimates the recurring component of revenues from N'Tandem and it's properties to stabilize.  Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased by $1,343,000 or 2.7 percent from the prior year. The majority of the increase was due to operating expense increases in the Company's Core 1999 Portfolio, and to a lesser extent, acquisitions. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance expense increased to $91.03 per site, or 2.0 percent.  Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased by $751,000 or 5.9 percent from the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase is due primarily to acquisitions, expansions of communities, and increases in property tax rates.                                          17   On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $23.57 in 2000 compared to $22.39 in 1999, an increase of 5.3 percent. Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Administrative expense in 2000 was 5.1 percent of total revenues as compared to 5.2 percent in 1999.  Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2000 by $4,082,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase is attributed primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions, development, and lending activities. Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding decreased to approximately 7.3 percent in 2000 from 7.4 percent in 1999.  Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $2,094,000 from the same period a year ago. The increase is directly attributed to acquisitions, expansions, and additions. Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in 2000 remained relatively unchanged from 1999.  Comparison of the year ended December 31, 1999 to the year ended December 31, 1998  The following table summarizes certain information relative to the Company's properties, as of and for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998. The Company considers all communities owned by the Company as of January 1, 1998 as the "Core 1998 Portfolio".

The increase was due primarily to acquisitions and increased net operating income from the Core 1998 Portfolio. The increase in net operating income from the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and rental increases partially offset by general operating expense increases. Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $177,789,000, an increase of $10,583,000 from 1998. Approximately 30 percent of the increase was due to acquisitions, net of dispositions, and 70 percent was due to rental increases and occupancy gains in the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio.  Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1999 was 47,181 sites compared with 45,882 sites for the same period in 1998. The Company also added 525 available sites to its portfolio through the expansion of its communities. The occupancy rate for the total portfolio was 91.7 percent on 51,659 sites as of December 31, 1999, compared to 92.4 percent on 51,101 sites as of December 31, 1998. The occupancy rate on the stabilized portfolio was 93.2 percent as of December 31, 1999. On a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $302 compared with $292 for the same period in 1998. For the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio, on a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $307 compared with $295 for the same period in 1998, an increase of 4.0 percent.                                         18   Interest income primarily includes interest on notes receivable and advances to joint ventures affiliates. The increase of $3,115,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 from the same period in 1998 is due primarily to increased interest income from Company-funded development projects, as well as increases in interest rates.  Management fee and other income primarily include management fee and transaction fee income for the management of 44 manufactured home communities, and equity earnings from CSI. The increase in 1999 from 1998 is due primarily to increased development activities in which the Company funds the development costs and recognizes interest income and expenses and increased equity earnings from CSI.  Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased by $3,412,000 or 7.3 percent from the same period a year ago. The majority of the increase was due to increases in the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio, and to a lesser extent, acquisitions. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance expense increased to $89.21 per site, or 4.3 percent.  Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased by $424,000 or 3.5 percent from the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase is due primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities and general increases. On a site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $22.39 in 1999 compared to $22.25 in 1998, an increase of .63 percent. Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Administrative expense in 1999 was 5.2 percent of total revenues as compared to 4.8 percent in 1998.  Interest and related amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased by $1,031,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase is attributed primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions and development. Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding decreased to approximately 7.4 percent for 1999 from 7.7 percent in 1998.  Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1999, increased $2,168,000 from the same period a year ago. The increase is directly attributed to acquisitions and expansions. Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in 1999 remained relatively unchanged from 1998.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Net cash provided by operating activities was $84,961,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $77,464,000 for the same period in 1999. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the increase in net operating income.  Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $73,123,000. This amount represents acquisitions, joint venture investments and advances, lending activity, capital expenditures and development costs. During 2000, the Company acquired two communities with a total of 410 sites and purchased development properties in Michigan and Iowa. These acquisitions were financed primarily by borrowings under the Company's lines of credit.  Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $12,087,000. This consisted primarily of $81,534,000 in dividends and distributions paid to shareholders and OP Unitholders, $214,997,000 in payment of debt, and repurchasing approximately $11.3 million of common shares, offset partially by proceeds from debt issuances of $295,295,000.                                         19   During 2000, the Company invested approximately $10,100,000 in the expansion of its existing communities, resulting in the addition of 275 available sites to its portfolio. In addition, during 2000, the Company invested or advanced $22,000,000 to certain affiliates of the Company. This consisted primarily of approximately $5,500,000 to joint ventures, through which the Company, or its joint venture partner is developing manufactured home communities, and $13,800,000 to N'Tandem, an entity in which the Company owns approximately 10 percent of its outstanding equity and has made loans aggregating $38,466,000 as of December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2000, recurring property capital expenditures, other than development costs, were approximately $7,400,000. Capital expenditures have historically been financed out of operating cash flow and it is the Company's intention that such future expenditures will also be financed out of operating cash flow.  At December 31, 2000, the Company had a $100 million line of credit arrangement with BankOne, NA acting as lead agent for a bank group to provide financing for future construction, acquisitions and general business obligations (the "BankOne Credit Facility"). The line of credit is unsecured, bears interest at the prime rate of interest or, at the Company's option, LIBOR plus 80 basis points. The line was scheduled to mature in 2001. In February 2001, the Company renegotiated the BankOne Credit Facility and increased it from $100 million to $125 million. The term of the new facility is three years and bears interest at LIBOR plus 90 basis points. In addition, the Company has a $7.5 million unsecured line of credit from US Bank, which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points and matures in October 2001 (the "US Bank Facility" and, together with the BankOne Credit Facility the "Credit Facilities"). As of December 31, 2000, approximately $74.7 million was outstanding under the Company's Credit Facilities and the Company had $32.8 million available in additional borrowing capacity, which was increased to approximately $57.8 million in available capacity with the February 2001 expansion of the BankOne Credit Facility.  As of December 31, 2000, the Company had outstanding, in addition to the Credit Facilities, $320 million of unsecured senior debt with a weighted average interest rate and remaining maturity of 7.5 percent and 3.7 years, respectively, and $136.9 million of secured mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate and remaining maturity of 7.8 percent and 8.9 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had approximately $535 million of total debt outstanding, representing approximately 34 percent of the Company's total market capitalization. All of the debt is fixed rate debt, other than the Company's Credit Facilities, and has a weighted average interest rate of 7.6 percent.  In June 2000, the Company issued $116 million of 7.8% fixed rate mortgage debt, maturing in 2010, and collateralized by seven properties. Also in 2000, the Company issued a total of $150 million of Unsecured Senior Notes, $100 million at 8.3% maturing March 1, 2005 and $50 million at 8% maturing August 1, 2003, resulting in net proceeds of $149 million. During 2000, the Company issued and repaid a $30 million unsecured short-term loan.  On February 29, 2000, the Company announced the establishment of a share repurchase program pursuant to which it may repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time. As of December 31, 2000, the Company repurchased 453,900 shares for approximately $11.3 million.  In addition to repayment of long-term borrowings and amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities, future acquisitions of communities and land for development and new community development activities represent the principal long-term liquidity needs of the Company. The Company does not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to finance these long-term liquidity needs and instead intends to meet its long-term liquidity requirements through additional borrowing under the Credit Facilities or other lines of credit, the assumption of existing secured or unsecured indebtedness and, depending on market conditions and capital availability factors, the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.  The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including expansion activities and capital expenditure requirements, through cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under the Credit Facilities and other lines of credit.                                         20   Inflation  All of the leases or terms of tenants' occupancies at the communities allow for at least annual rental adjustments. In addition, all leases are short-term (generally one year or less) and enable the Company to seek market rentals upon reletting the sites. Such leases generally minimize the risk to the Company of any adverse effect of inflation.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. This new standard requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. In June 1999, FASB issued SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133-an amendment of SFAS No. 133." SFAS No. 137 defers the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138,"Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133". This statement amends certain requirements of SFAS 133. The Company will prospectively adopt SFAS No. 138 on January 1, 2001, the required date of adoption. The adoption of SFAS No. 138 will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company, but will result in the reclassification of certain deferred gains and losses to accumulated other comprehensive income.  In 2000, the Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 101 released by the Securities and Exchange Commission, entitled "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements". SAB 101 establishes guidelines in applying generally accepted accounting principles to the recognition of revenue in financial statements based on specific criteria. The adoption of SAB 101 had no material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.  Other  Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as consolidated net income of the Company without giving effect to gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property and rental property depreciation and amortization. Management believes that FFO is an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of REITs, which provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO is calculated as follows:                                         21                                                                          For the Year Ended December 31, (In thousands)                                   2000            1999             1998             1997                1996                                                ---------       ---------        ---------        ---------           ---------            Income before minority interest                $  48,722       $  44,962        $  34,486        $  24,688           $  16,100 Less:   Income allocated to      Preferred OP Units                            6,094           6,094            4,249                -                   - Plus:   Depreciation of rental property                 43,289          41,161           38,962           30,867              11,360   Amortization of intangibles                          -             405              446              407                   -   Gain on sales of properties                          -          (2,805)            (253)               -                   -                                                ---------       ---------        ---------        ---------           --------- Funds from operations                          $  85,917       $  77,629        $  69,392        $  55,962           $  27,460                                                =========       =========        =========        =========           =========   NAREIT has revised its definition of FFO. The Company adopted the new definition effective January 1, 2000. The new definition of FFO substantially eliminates the add-back of the non-recurring items in the calculation of FFO. The application of this new definition decreased FFO in 1998 by $375,000, and had no effect on any other years reported.  Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - --------  ----------------------------------------------------------  The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. Management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed-rate, long-term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level and (2) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. As of December 31, 2000, the Company's Credit Facilities represented its only variable rate debt.  The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2000, concerning the Company's debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("FV"):                                                                  For the Year Ended December 31,                                2001         2002         2003         2004         2005      Thereafter      Total          FV                     Debt obligations    Fixed rate                $  1,320     $ 1,842     $ 121,483    $ 103,338    $ 107,947    $ 120,969     $ 456,899     $ 454,079    Average interest rate          7.9%        7.9%          7.7%         6.8%         8.5%         7.8%          7.6%    Variable rate             $ 74,730                                                                      $  74,730     $  74,730    Average interest rate          7.5%  Total debt                  $ 76,050     $ 1,842     $ 121,483    $ 103,338    $ 107,947    $ 120,969     $ 531,629     $ 528,809   The Company faces market risk relating to its fixed-rate debt upon re-financing of such debt and depending upon prevailing interest rates at the time of such re-finance. As a result of the Company's successful re-financing and extension of its fixed-rate debt, as illustrated in the above chart, it will not need to re-finance any of its fixed-rate debt until 2003.  In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in LIBOR rates would result in an approximate $747,000 increase in interest expense based on $74.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2000.  The fair value of the Company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.                                         22   Item 8.
