Item 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and - -------    -------------------------------------------------------------- Results of Operations - ---------------------  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere  in this Annual Report.  Certain statements in this discussion constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements may involve the Company's plans, objectives and expectations, which are dependent upon a number of factors, including site expansions, acquisitions, development and other new business initiatives that are subject to a number of contingency factors such as the effects of national and local economic conditions, changes in interest rates, supply and demand for affordable housing and the condition of the capital markets that may prevent the Company from achieving its objectives.  Overview  The Company is one of the largest owner/managers of manufactured home communities in the United States. The Company added a net of 118 manufactured home communities to its portfolio over the three-year period ended December 31, 1999.  At the end of this period, the Company's portfolio was comprised of 165 manufactured home communities containing 51,659 manufactured homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites, located in 28 states.  Company growth since the beginning of 1997 can be attributed to the Company's merger with ROC in February 1997 (the "Merger"), as well as acquisitions, increased operating performance at existing communities, community expansions, and new community development.  During 1998, the Company acquired 34 communities (the "Acquisition Properties") in four separate portfolio acquisitions, containing an aggregate of 7,045 manufactured homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites.  During 1999, the Company acquired 2 communities, containing 624 sites.  Since its organization, the Company has elected to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and thus does not generally pay federal corporate income taxes on its earnings to the extent that such earnings are distributed to shareholders.  The Company conducts substantially all of its activities through CP Limited Partnership ("the Operating Partnership") in which it owned a combined 89 percent general partner interest as of December 31, 1999.                                          18   Historical Results of Operations  Comparison of the year ended December 31, 1999 to the year ended December 31, 1998  The following table summarizes certain information relative to the Company's properties, as of and for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998. The Company considers all communities owned by the Company as of January 1, 1998 as the "Core 1998 Portfolio".

The increase was due primarily to acquisitions and increased net operating income from the Core 1998 Portfolio.  The increase in net operating income from the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and rental increases partially offset by general operating expense increases.  Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $177,789,000, an increase of $10,583,000 from 1998.  Approximately 30 percent of the increase was due to acquisitions, net of dispositions, and 70 percent was due to rental increases and occupancy gains in the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio.  Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1999 was 47,181 sites compared with 45,882 sites for the same period in 1998.  The Company also added 525 available sites to its portfolio through the expansion of its communities. The occupancy rate for the total portfolio was 91.7 percent on 51,659 sites as of December 31, 1999, compared to 92.4 percent on 51,101 sites as of December 31, 1998.  The occupancy rate on the stabilized portfolio was 93.2 percent as of December 31, 1999. On a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $302 compared with $292 for the same period in 1998. For the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio, on a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $307 compared with $295 for the same period in 1998, an increase of 4.0 percent.                                          19   Management fee, interest and other income primarily include management fee and transaction fee income for the management of 44 manufactured home communities, equity earnings from the Company's sales subsidiary, CSI, and interest income on notes receivable and advances to affiliates.  The increase in 1999 from 1998 is due primarily to increased development activities in which the Company funds the development costs and recognizes interest income and expenses, increased equity earnings from CSI, increased advances to affiliates other than for development, and increases in management and transaction fees from properties managed by the Company.  Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased by $3,412,000 or 7.3 percent from the same period a year ago.  The majority of the increase was due to acquisitions and increases in the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio.  On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance expense increased to $89.21 per site, or 4.3 percent.  Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased by $424,000 or 3.5 percent from the year ended December 31, 1998.  The increase is due primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities and general increases. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $22.39 in 1999 compared to $22.25 in 1998, an increase of .63 percent.  Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased primarily due to the increased size of the Company.  Administrative expense in 1999 was 5.2 percent of total revenues as compared to 4.8 percent in 1998.  Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December 31, 1999 by $1,031,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1998.  The increase is attributable primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions and development.  Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding decreased to approximately 7.4 percent from 7.7 percent in 1998.  Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1999, increased $2,168,000 from the same period a year ago.  The increase is directly attributable to acquisitions and expansions.  Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in 1999 remained relatively unchanged from 1998.                                          20   Comparison of the year ended December 31, 1998 to the year ended December 31, 1997  The following table summarizes certain information relative to the Company's properties, as of and for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.  The Company considers all communities owned by the Company or ROC as of January 1, 1997 as the "Core 1997 Portfolio".

The increase was due primarily to acquisitions and the Merger, as well as increased net operating income from the Core 1997 Portfolio.  The increase in net operating income from the Company's Core 1997 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and rental increases partially offset by general operating expense increases.  Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1998 was $167,206,000, an increase of $32,405,000 from 1997.  Approximately 57 percent was due to acquisitions and 18 percent was due to the Merger.  The remaining 25 percent increase was due to rental increases and occupancy gains in the Company's Core 1997 Portfolio.  Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1998 was 45,882 sites compared with 38,053 sites for the same period in 1997. During 1998, the Company increased occupancy by 627 sites, of which 344 were in its active expansion communities.  The Company also added 407 sites to its portfolio through the expansion of its communities.  The occupancy rate for the total portfolio was 92.4 percent on 51,101 sites as of December 31, 1998, compared to 92.0 percent on 43,800 sites as of December 31, 1997.  The occupancy rate on the stabilized portfolio was 94.0 percent as of December 31, 1998. On a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1998 was $292 compared with $287 for the same period in 1997. For the Company's Core 1997 Portfolio, on a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1998 was $299 compared with $286 for the same period in 1997, an increase of 4.5 percent.                                         21   Management fee, interest and other income primarily include management fee income for the management of 36 manufactured home communities, equity earnings from the Company's sales subsidiary, CSI, and interest income on notes receivable and advances to affiliates.  The increase in 1998 from 1997 is due primarily to increased development activities in which the Company funds the development costs and recognizes interest income and expense.  Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased by 20.3 percent from the same period a year ago.  The majority of the increase was due to the acquisitions and the Merger. The remaining increase was due to increases in the Company's Core 1997 Portfolio.  On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance expense remained constant at $86.  Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased by $2,305,000 or 23.2 percent from the year ended December 31, 1997.  The increase is due primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities, the Merger and general increases.  On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $22.25 in 1998 compared to $21.78 in 1997, an increase of 2.2 percent.  Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased due to acquisitions and the Merger. Administrative expense in 1998 was 4.8 percent of total revenues as compared to 5.0 percent in 1997.  Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December 31, 1998 by $5,369,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1997.  The increase is attributable primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisitions.  Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding remained relatively constant at approximately 7.7 percent.  Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1998, increased $8,148,000 from the same period a year ago.  The increase is directly attributable to acquisitions and the Merger.  Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in 1998 remained relatively unchanged from 1997.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Net cash provided by operating activities was $77,464,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, compared to $72,560,000 for the same period in 1998.  The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the increase in net operating income.  Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $20,789,000.  This consisted primarily of $60,244,000 in dividends and distributions paid to shareholders and OP Unitholders and $23,598,000 in payoffs of mortgages, offset partially by net borrowings on the Company's lines of credit of $60,581,000.  Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $56,777,000.  This amount represents acquisitions, joint venture investments and advances, capital expenditures and development costs. During 1999, the Company acquired two communities with a total of 624 sites and purchased a development property in Michigan.  These acquisitions were financed primarily by borrowings under the Company's lines of credit.  The Company also disposed of two properties containing 509 sites.  During 1999, the Company invested approximately $14 million in the expansion of its existing communities, resulting in the addition of 525 available sites to its portfolio. In addition, during 1999, the Company invested or advanced $32 million to certain affiliates of the Company.  This consisted                                          22   primarily of approximately $16 million to 9 joint ventures, through which the Company, or its joint venture partner is developing manufactured home communities, and $13.5 million to N'Tandem Trust, an entity in which the Company owns approximately 10 percent of its outstanding equity. For the year ended December 31, 1999, recurring property capital expenditures, other than development costs, were approximately $7 million. Capital expenditures have historically been financed out of funds from operations and it is the Company's intention that such future expenditures will also be financed with funds from operations.  As of December 31, 1999, the Company had a line of credit with Bank One, N.A., acting as lead agent, for $100 million (the "Bank One Credit Facility").  The interest rate is at LIBOR plus 80 basis points, and matures in May 2001.  In addition to the Bank One Credit Facility, the Company had a $7.5 million revolving line of credit from US Bank which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points and a maturity of September 2000 (the "USB Facility" and, together with the Bank One Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities").  As of December 31, 1999, approximately $97.3 million was outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the Company had available $10.2 million in additional borrowing capacity.  As of December 31, 1999, the Company had outstanding, in addition to the Credit Facilities, $245 million of unsecured senior debt with a weighted average interest rate and remaining maturity of 7.5 percent and 3.2 years, respectively, and $106 million of secured mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate and remaining maturity of 7.6 percent and 1.7 years, respectively.  As of December 31, 1999, the Company had approximately $453 million of total debt outstanding, representing approximately 33 percent of the Company's total market capitalization.  All of the debt is fixed rate debt, other than the Company's Credit Facilities, and has a weighted average interest rate of 7.5 percent.  In February 2000, the Company issued $100 million of 8.5% Unsecured Senior Notes due March 1, 2005. The Company received net proceeds of nearly $99 million, which were used to repay $75 million of 8.75% Senior Unsecured Notes which matured March 2, 2000.  The remaining $24 million was used to repay a portion of the borrowings on its line of credit.  The Company, in February, also entered into a $30 million note with Bank One, N.A.  The note can be drawn on for thirty, sixty or ninety day increments beginning February 18, 2000, and must be repaid in full on August 18, 2000.  The note bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points.  The funds available under the note are expected to be used to fund short term liquidity needs of the Company.  The Company has another $86 million coming due in 2000 which it expects to repay with the proceeds from the issuance of secured or unsecured debt, depending on the current market conditions.  On February 29, 2000, the Company announced the establishment of a share repurchase program pursuant to which it may repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time.  In addition to repayment of long-term borrowings and amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities, future acquisitions of communities and land for development and new community development activities represent the principal long-term liquidity needs of the Company.  The Company does not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to finance these long-term liquidity needs and instead intends to meet its long-term liquidity requirements through additional borrowing under the Credit Facilities or other lines of credit, the assumption of existing secured or unsecured indebtedness and depending on market conditions and capital availability factors, the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.  The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including expansion activities and capital expenditure requirements and maturing debt obligations, through cash flows from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under the Credit Facilities and other lines of credit.                                           23   Inflation  All of the leases or terms of tenants' occupancies at the communities allow for at least annual rental adjustments.  In addition, all leases are short-term (generally one year or less) and enable the Company to seek market rentals upon reletting the sites.  Such leases generally minimize the risk to the Company of any adverse effect of inflation.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"), which is effective for the Company in the year 2000.  The only derivative instrument the Company currently utilizes is an interest rate hedge agreement for $75 million of its senior notes.  SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be measured on the balance sheet at fair value.  The Company anticipates that the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a significant effect on its 2000 financial statements.  In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133," which delays the implementation of SFAS 133 for the Company's financial statements to January 1, 2001.  In anticipation of the $75 million senior notes maturing on March 2, 2000, the Company entered into a $75 million interest rate hedge transaction with a financial institution in order to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, with a maturity of April 2000.  Under this arrangement, the Company pays or receives an amount equal to the difference between the hedge rate and the market rate on the date of settlement, based on an anticipated $75 million borrowing.  The realized gain or loss on the transaction settlement date will be recorded on the balance sheet and amortized to interest expense over the period of the related notes.  At December 31, 1999, the treasury lock rate was lower than the market rate, therefore, the Company has an unrealized gain of approximately $692,000.  Year 2000  The year 2000 issue exists because many computer systems and applications abbreviate dates by eliminating the first two digits of the year, assuming that these two digits are always "19".  As a result, date-sensitive computer programs may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. Unless corrected, the potential exists for computer system failures or incorrect processing of financial and operational information, which could disrupt operations.  The Company believes that all systems have been appropriately modified and does not expect the year 2000 issue will materially impact the financial condition or operations of the Company.                                           24   Other  Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as consolidated net income of the Company without giving effect to gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property, certain non-recurring items and rental property depreciation and amortization.  Management believes that FFO is an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of REITs, which provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  FFO is calculated as follows:    For the year ended December 31,                                                         1999            1998           1997                                                    --------------  --------------  --------------        (in thousands)  Income before extraordinary item    and minority interests                          $       44,962  $       34,486  $       24,688 Less:    Income allocated to Preferred OP Units                   6,094           4,249               - Plus:    Depreciation of rental property                         41,161          38,962          30,867    Amortization of intangibles                                405             446             407    Non-recurring items, net                                     -             122               -    Gain on sales of properties                             (2,805)              -               -                                                    --------------  --------------  -------------- Funds from operations                              $       77,629  $       69,767  $       55,962                                                    ==============  ==============  ==============    NAREIT has revised its definition of FFO.  The Company plans to adopt the new definition effective January 1, 2000.  The new definition of FFO substantially eliminates the add back of the non-recurring items in the calculation of the FFO.  The application of this new would not have affected reported FFO for calendar year 1999 or 1997, and would have decreased FFO in 1998 by $375,000.                                         25   Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - --------  ----------------------------------------------------------  The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.  Management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk by  (1) maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level and (2) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.  As of December 31, 1999, the Company's Credit Facilities represented its only variable rate debt.  The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 1999, concerning the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("FV"):                                                                    For the Year Ended December 31,                                    2000       2001        2002         2003         2004      Thereafter     Total        FV                                   ----       ----        ----         ----         ----      ----------     -----        --                  Long term debt:    Fixed Rate                 $ 161,545    $   396     $   843     $ 70,401     $100,436      $ 17,181    $350,802    $345,246    Average interest rate            8.1%       8.3%        8.2%         7.5%         6.9%          7.6%        7.5%    Variable rate                  5,317     92,000                                                          97,317      97,317    Average interest rate            7.1%       6.9%  Total debt                    $ 166,862    $ 92,396    $   843     $ 70,401     $100,436      $ 17,181    $448,119    $442,563   In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would have an approximate $973,000 increase in interest expense based on $97.3 million outstanding at December 31, 1999.  The fair value of the Company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.                                          26   Item 8.
