ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial  condition covers the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 and should  be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the  Company included elsewhere herein.  On February 11, 1997, the Company completed its merger with ROC Communities,  Inc. ("ROC") (the "Merger").  The pro forma discussion covers the years ended  December 31, 1996 and 1995 assuming the Merger and related transactions had  occurred on January 1, 1995.  This pro forma discussion should be read in  conjunction with Note 12 to the financial statements of the Company included  elsewhere herein.  HISTORICAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995  For the year ended December 31, 1996, income before majority interest and  extraordinary item was $16,100,000, an increase of $2,121,000 from the year  ended December 31, 1995.  The increase was due primarily to increased net  operating income from communities owned by the Company on January 1, 1995  (the "Core 1995 Portfolio") and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of three  communities in 1996 and one community in 1995.  The increase in net operating  income from the Company's Core 1995 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy  and rental increases offset by general operating expense increases.  Rental revenue in 1996 was $64,695,000, an increase of $4,783,000 or 8.0  percent from 1995.  Approximately 2.3 percent of the increase was due to the  acquisitions of three communities in 1996 and one in 1995, 3.9 percent  represented the effect of annual rent increases in the Core 1995 Portfolio  and 1.8 percent was due to increased occupancy in the Core 1995 Portfolio.   Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1996, was 18,889  sites, or 4.6 percent higher than weighted average occupancy for the year  ended December 31, 1995. Weighted average occupancy increased in 1996 due to  the 1996 and 1995 acquisitions and the filling of 265 additional sites that  were either vacant at January 1, 1996 or developed in 1996.  The occupancy  rate was 94.4 percent on 20,279 sites as of December 31, 1996, as compared  with 94.3 percent on 19,594 sites as of December 31, 1995.  On a per site  basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December  31, 1996 increased to $285 from $277 in 1995 or 3.2 percent due to rental  increases in the Core 1995 Portfolio in 1996.  Interest and other income increased approximately $746,000, or 38 percent, in  1996 from 1995.  The increase is due primarily to the inclusion of the  results of operations of four golf courses and a marina for the period  beginning January 1, 1996.  These operations were previously conducted by GC  Properties, Inc. ("GCI"), a corporation wholly owned by an equity owner of  the Company, in order to permit the Company's qualification as a REIT under  the Internal Revenue Code. From November 23, 1993 through December 31, 1995,  the Company recognized net lease income from GCI which was classified as  other income.  In early 1996, the Company received a ruling from the Internal  Revenue Service allowing the Company to conduct these operations.  Effective  January 1, 1996, as a result of acquiring the operations of GCI, the Company  has consolidated these operations.                                          12    Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31,  1996 increased by $2,180,000 or 13.6 percent from the same period a year ago.  Approximately $1,028,000 of the increase represents the operating costs of  the golf course and marina operations discussed above.  The remaining  increase of $1,152,000 or a 7.2 percent increase over the prior year, is due  primarily to the acquisition of three communities in 1996 and one in 1995.   On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and  maintenance expense increased from $74 in 1995 to $80 in 1996, or 8.6  percent.  Excluding the golf course and marina operations, monthly weighted  average property operating and maintenance expense increased 2.4 percent, on  a per site basis, year over year.  Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1996, increased by  $333,000, or 7.4 percent, from the year ended December 31, 1995.  The  increase is due primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities and  general increases. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate  taxes were $21.40 in 1996 compared to $20.90  in 1995, an increase of 2.6  percent. Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation,  expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in taxation in  the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Administrative expense for 1996 was relatively constant with 1995.  Administrative expense in 1996 was 5.7 percent of revenues as compared to 6.3  percent in 1995.  Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December  31, 1996, by $510,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1995.   The increase is attributable to the indebtedness incurred to finance the 1996  acquisitions of three communities and one in 1995, as well as the investment  in a joint venture with ROC that owns six development communities.  Interest  expense also increased due to the financing of the Company's repurchase and  retirement of 450,000 shares of its common stock in connection with the  Merger. Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding  decreased to approximately 8.1 percent in 1996 from approximately 8.9 percent  in 1995.  Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1996, increased $438,000  from the same period a year ago.  The increase is due to acquisitions and  expansions.  Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable  rental property in 1996 remained relatively unchanged from 1995.  COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994  For the year ended December 31, 1995, income before majority interest and  extraordinary item was $13,979,000, a decrease of $918,000 from the year  ended December 31, 1994.  The decrease was due to an increase in depreciation  of $3,784,000 and increased interest costs of $6,456,000, which were offset  by increased net operating income of $9,322,000.  These increases were  primarily due to the acquisitions of one community in 1995 and 10 communities  in 1994, as well as an increase in net rental revenue from the communities  owned by the Company on January 1, 1994 (the "Core 1994 Portfolio").  The  increase in net operating income from the Company's Core 1994 Portfolio was  due to increased occupancy and rental increases offset by general operating  expense increases. In the first quarter 1995, the Company recognized an  extraordinary charge of $829,000 related to the early extinguishment of debt.                                              13   Rental revenue in 1995 was $59,912,000, an increase of  $12,594,000 or 26.6  percent from 1994.  Approximately 84.8 percent of the increase was due to the  acquisition of one community in September 1995 and 10 communities in 1994,  eight of which were acquired in the fourth quarter, 9.2 percent represents  the effect of annual rent increases in the Core 1994 Portfolio and 6.0  percent was due to increased occupancy in the Core 1994 Portfolio.  Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1995, was 18,051  sites, or 21 percent higher than weighted average occupancy for the year  ended December 31, 1994. Weighted average occupancy increased in 1995 due to  the 1995 and 1994 acquisitions and the filling of 381 additional sites that  were either vacant at January 1, 1995, or developed in 1995.  The occupancy  rate was 94.3 percent on 19,594 sites as of December 31, 1995, as compared  with 92.7 percent on 19,185 sites as of December 31, 1994.  On a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year  ended December 31, 1995 increased to $277 from $264 in 1994 or 4.6 percent.   This increase was due to acquisitions made in 1995 and 1994 and rental  increases in the Core 1994 Portfolio in 1995, partially offset by a weighted  average $2 per month per site rebate that the Company passed through to its  Michigan residents. The rebate represented the net savings realized by the  Company from a change in real estate taxation in Michigan.  Interest and other income increased approximately $1,194,000, or 159 percent,  in 1995 from 1994 primarily due to other operating revenues generated by the  communities acquired by the Company in November 1994.  Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31,  1995, increased by $3,524,000 or 28.2 percent from the same period a year  ago.  The increase is due primarily to the 1995 and 1994 acquisitions.  On a  per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance  expense increased from $70 in 1994 to $74 in 1995, or 5.9 percent.  The  increase on a per site basis is due principally to certain of the communities  acquired in 1994 having a higher per site operating cost, an increase in  advertising and other costs incurred to fill sites and utility rate  increases.  The higher per site operating cost in certain of the acquired  communities is due, in part, to the costs associated with the other operating  revenues generated by these communities.  The increase in advertising  spending resulted in the net filling of 381 sites for 1995, while only 170  sites were filled for the year ended December 31, 1994.  Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1995, increased by  $688,000, or 17.9 percent, from the year ended December 31, 1994.  The  increase is due primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities.  On  a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $20.90 in  1995 compared to $21.40 in 1994, a decrease of 2.6 percent.  The decrease was  due primarily to a change in real estate taxation in Michigan and  acquisitions which had a lower per site real estate tax cost, offset by  general tax increases.  The change in real estate taxation decreased real  estate taxes beginning in the third and fourth quarter of 1994, and first and  second quarter of 1995.  Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to  inflation, expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in  taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 1995, increased  $254,000, or 7.0 percent, from the year ended December 31, 1994.  Administrative expense in 1995 was 6.3 percent of revenues as compared to 7.5  percent in 1994.                                          14    Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December  31, 1995, by $6,456,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1994.   The increase is attributable to the indebtedness incurred to finance the 1995  and 1994 acquisitions of 10 communities.  Interest expense as a percentage of  average debt outstanding decreased to approximately 8.9 percent in 1995 from  approximately 9.4 percent in 1994 due to debt refinancing that occurred in  the first quarter of 1995.  Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1995, increased  $3,784,000 from the same period a year ago.  The increase is due to the 1995  and 1994 acquisitions of 10 communities for a combined purchase price of  approximately $117 million.  Depreciation expense as a percentage of average  depreciable rental property in 1995 remained relatively unchanged from 1994.  PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  PRO FORMA YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO PRO FORMA YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31,1995  Rental revenue increased $7,200,000 or 6 percent in 1996 over 1995 due to  increased occupancy and rental increases in communities owned by the Company  on January 1, 1995.  Other revenues increased approximately $800,000 or 20  percent for the year ended December 31, 1996 over 1995 due primarily to golf  course and marina operations which were consolidated in 1996 and recorded as  net lease income in 1995 as discussed above.  Property, operating, maintenance and administrative expense increased  $4,100,000 or 8.3 percent in 1996 as compared to 1995.  Excluding the  expenses of the golf course and marina operations discussed above, the  increase would have been $3,000,000 or 6.1 percent.  This increase is due to  the increased number of occupied sites, as well as general increases.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Net cash provided by operating activities was $29,755,000 for the year ended  December 31, 1996, compared to $28,097,000 for the year ended December 31,  1995. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily  to the increase in net operating income.  Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996,  was $595,000.  Use of cash included distributions made to shareholders/OP  Unit holders of $24,065,000; the payment of $932,000 to reacquire 43,333 OP  units at $21.50 per Unit and the payment of $11,239,000 to repurchase and  retire 450,000 shares of the Company's common stock in connection with the  Merger.  The shares were repurchased in October 1996 at an average price of  approximately $25.00 per share.  This use of cash was offset partially by net  borrowings under the Company's line of credit of $36,750,000.  Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996  was $29,518,000.   This amount represented the acquisition of three  communities, joint venture investments, capital expenditures and construction  and development costs.  The acquisition of the three communities for an  aggregate purchase price of $9,200,000 were financed by $8,200,000 borrowed  on the Company's line of credit and $1,000,000 through the issuance of 43,884  OP units.  The investment in the joint venture with ROC of $10,300,000 was  financed by a borrowing on the Company's line of credit.  The Company also  invested approximately                                        15    $3,200,000 in cash in other joint ventures.  For the year ended December 31,  1996, construction and development costs approximated $3,700,000, while  recurring property capital expenditures, other than construction and  development costs, were approximately $635,000. Recurring property capital  expenditures in 1996 increased $94,000, or 17 percent, over the same period  in 1995, due to the increased number of communities in the Company's  portfolio.  Capital expenditures have historically been financed with funds  from operations and it is the Company's intention that such future  expenditures will be financed with funds from operations.  Future acquisitions of communities and land for development of sites will be  financed through borrowings on the line of credit, the issuance of additional  equity or debt securities, assumption of existing secured or unsecured  indebtedness or the issuance of OP units.  The development of expansion sites  will be financed primarily by cash flow from operations and borrowings on the  line of credit.  Huntington National Bank, as lead agent, along with Bank of  America and First Chicago NBD, have agreed, until January, 1999, to lend the  Company up to $50 million which, subject to customary conditions, is  available to finance the development of expansion sites, the acquisition of  additional properties and general business obligations.  This line of credit  is unsecured and bears interest at 150 basis points over LIBOR.  At December  31, 1996, there was $36,750,000 outstanding under the line of credit.  The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through  cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under its line of  credit.  The Company anticipates meeting its long-term liquidity requirements from  borrowings under its line of credit, from the issuance of additional debt or  equity securities and cash flows from operations.  The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various environmental  laws.  Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material  adverse financial effect on results of operations or financial position  during the three year period ended December 31, 1996, nor does management  believe it will have a material impact in the future.  PRO FORMA INDEBTEDNESS  On a pro forma basis as of December 31, 1996, the Company had the following  debt outstanding (in thousands):  Fixed rate mortgages                            $113,979  Fixed rate unsecured debt                        145,000  Unsecured lines of credit                         66,993  Other debt                                         2,124                                                  --------                                                  $328,096                                                  --------                                                  --------   The weighted average interest rate and remaining term of the fixed rate debt  was approximately 8.1 percent and 4.3 years, respectively.  The only variable  rate debt outstanding is drawn on lines of credit.  After the Merger, the  Company has two available credit facilities aggregating $100 million, each of  which is unsecured and bears interest at 150 basis points over LIBOR.                                       16    INFLATION  All of the leases or terms of tenants' occupancies at the communities allow  for at least annual rental adjustments.  In addition, all leases are  short-term (generally one year or less) and enable the Company to seek market  rentals upon reletting the sites.  Such leases generally minimize the risk to  the Company of any adverse effect of inflation.  OTHER  Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real  Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as net income excluding gains (or losses)  from debt restructuring and sales of property plus rental property  depreciation and amortization.  Management believes that FFO is an important  and widely used measure of the operating performance of REIT's which provides  a relevant basis for comparison among REITs.  For all periods presented,  depreciation of rental property is the only non-cash adjustment.  FFO (i)  does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted  accounting principles; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net  income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities; and (iii) is not an alternative to cash  flows as a measure of liquidity.  FFO is calculated as follows:                                                      For the year                                                               ended December 31,                                                   ---------------------------------                                             1996         1995         1994                                              -------      -------      -------  Income before extraordinary item          $16,100      $13,979      $14,897  Depreciation of rental property            11,360       10,919        7,118                                            -------      -------      -------  Funds from operations                     $27,460      $24,898      $22,015   On a pro forma basis, FFO is calculated as follows:                                                For the year                                                 ended December 31,                                             --------------------                                             1996         1995                                              -------      -------  Income before minority interest           $18,000      $13,100  Depreciation of rental property            34,300       34,200  Amortization of other intangibles             400          500                                            -------      -------   Funds from operations                     $52,700      $47,800                                        17    ITEM 8.
