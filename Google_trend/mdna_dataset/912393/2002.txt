Item 7.   Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results - ------    ---------------------------------------------------------------------           of Operations           -------------  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Certain statements in this discussion constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements may involve our plans, objectives and expectations, which are dependent upon a number of factors, including site expansions, development, acquisitions, dispositions and other new business initiatives which are all subject to a number of contingency factors such as the effects of national and local economic conditions, changes in interest rates, supply and demand for affordable housing and the condition of the capital markets that may prevent us from achieving our objectives.  Overview  We added 19,622 manufactured home sites to our portfolio over the three-year period ended December 31, 2001. This includes acquisitions and dispositions of manufactured home communities, as well as our development activity. At the end of this period, our portfolio comprised 217 manufactured home communities containing 70,723 manufactured homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites, located in 33 states.  We also provide property management and advisory services to N'Tandem Trust ("N'Tandem"). N'Tandem owns 36 communities with an aggregate of 7,882 homesites. We own approximately ten percent of N'Tandem's outstanding equity and have made loans and advances to N'Tandem.  We conduct substantially all of our activities through CP Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") in which we owned a combined 83 percent general partner interest as of December 31, 2001. In addition, effective January 1, 2001, we consolidated six development joint ventures that we control. The effects of consolidation were not material to our financial position or results of our operations.  We also conduct manufactured home sales and brokerage activities through our taxable subsidiary Community Sales, Inc. ("CSI").  Company growth since the beginning of 1999 can be attributed to community acquisitions, increased operating performance at existing communities, community expansions, and new community development, offset somewhat by property dispositions. On August 1, 2001, we purchased CWS Communities Trust ("CWS"), a private real estate investment trust for approximately $552 million. The portfolio consisted of 46 manufactured home communities with approximately 16,600 homesites and approximately 1,500 expansion sites and three RV communities with 431 RV sites in 11 states. This transaction extended our leading position in the manufactured housing community sector, making us substantially larger than our next largest REIT competitor in that sector.  Since our organization, we have elected to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and thus do not generally pay Federal corporate income taxes on earnings to the extent that such earnings are distributed to shareholders in accordance with REIT requirements.   Historical Results of Operations  Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2001 to the year ended December 31, 2000  The following table summarizes certain information relative to our properties, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. We consider all communities owned by us at both January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001, as the "Core 2000 Portfolio".                                         18                                                  Core 2000 Portfolio                   Total Dollars in thousands, except per site       2001           2000             2001           2000                                         ---------     -----------      -----------    ------------          As of December 31, - -------------------------------- Number of communities                         160            160               217             166 Total manufactured homesites               52,078         51,570            70,723          52,347 Occupied sites                             46,455         47,114            62,478          47,678 Occupancy %                                  89.2%          91.4%             88.3%           91.1%  For the year ended, December 31, - -------------------------------- Rental income                           $ 192,234     $  185,026       $   224,431    $    186,963 Property operating expenses             $  73,066     $   65,417       $    86,481    $     65,845 Net operating income                    $ 119,168     $  119,609       $   137,950    $    121,118 Weighted average monthly rent per site  $     331     $      316       $       331    $        316    For the year ended December 31, 2001, income before minority interests was $36,118,000, a decrease of $12,604,000 from the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease was due primarily to increased depreciation due to the acquisition of CWS. Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $224,431,000, an increase of $37,468,000 from 2000. Approximately 81 percent of the increase was due to acquisitions, net of dispositions, and 19 percent was due to rental increases in our Core 2000 Portfolio.  As of December 31, 2001, occupancy in our stabilized portfolio, was 92.5 percent. The active expansion portfolio had occupancy of 79.5 percent, while our greenfield development portfolio had occupancy of 30.8 percent, for a total occupancy of 88.3 percent. On a per-site basis, weighted monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $331 compared with $316 for the same period in 2000, an increase of 4.6 percent.  Management fee and other income primarily include management fee and transaction fee income for the management of 38 manufactured home communities and equity earnings from CSI.  Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased by $18,360,000 or 35.0 percent from the prior year. The majority of the increase was due to the acquisition of CWS, along with increased bad debt and collection costs of approximately $5,300,000 and operating expense increases in our Core 2000 Portfolio. The increase in bad debt expense was due to economic conditions as well as the implementation of our enterprise-wide technology solution. In many of our market areas the economic conditions have created a more difficult than normal collections environment, which has significantly impacted the cost of collections, as well the overall ability to collect past due amounts. In addition, difficulties encountered related to the implementation and utilization of our enterprise-wide technology solution, which was initiated in the last quarter of 2000, was also a factor in the unusually high expense recognized in 2001.  The majority of problems were isolated to less than 10 percent of our communities, and we are working diligently to bring the collections performance of these locations in line with the rest of the portfolio. Although we believe that these issues have been substantially resolved, we will continue to monitor the collections performance of each community as well as to improve operational processes to ensure timely billing and collection of delinquent accounts.  Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased by $2,276,000 or 17.0 percent from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase is due primarily to acquisitions, expansion of communities, and increases in property tax rates. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $24.10 in 2001 compared to $23.57 in 2000. Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansion and improvement of communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.                                         19    Administrative expense in 2001 was 4.1 percent of total revenues as compared to 4.8 percent in 2000.  Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2001 by $11,218,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase is attributed primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions and lending activities. Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding decreased to approximately 6.8 percent in 2001 from 7.3 percent in 2000, due to lower interest rates, and greater amounts of variable rate debt.  Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $13,999,000 from the same period a year ago. The increase is directly attributed to acquisitions, expansions, and additions of rental property. Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in 2001 remained relatively unchanged from 2000.  Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2000 to the year ended December 31, 1999  The following table summarizes certain information relative to our properties, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999. We consider all communities owned by us at both January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2000 as the "Core 1999 Portfolio".

The increase was due primarily to increased net operating income from the Core 1999 Portfolio and acquisitions. The increase in net operating income from our Core 1999 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and rental increases partially offset by general operating expense increases. Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $186,963,000, an increase of $9,174,000 from 1999. Approximately 17 percent of the increase was due to acquisitions, net of dispositions, and 83 percent was due to rental increases and occupancy gains in our Core 1999 Portfolio.  Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2000 was 47,466 sites compared with 47,181 sites for the same period in 1999. The occupancy rate for the total portfolio was 91.1 percent on 52,347 sites as of December 31, 2000, compared to 91.7 percent on 51,659 sites as of December 31, 1999. The occupancy rate on the stabilized portfolio (communities where we do not have or have not recently had, expansion of the community) was 94.7 percent as of December 31, 2000. We also added 275 available sites to our portfolio through expansion of our communities. On a per-site basis, weighted monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $316 compared with $302 for the same period in 1999.  Management fee and other income primarily includes management fee and transaction fee income for the management of 44 manufactured home communities and equity earnings from CSI.                                         20    Included in interest income and management fee and other income is approximately $3.2 million of interest and related fees, from N'Tandem.  Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased by $1,913,000 or 3.8 percent from the prior year. The majority of the increase was due to operating expense increases in our Core 1999 Portfolio, and to a lesser extent, acquisitions. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance expense increased to $91.03 per site, or 2.0 percent.  Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased by $751,000 or 5.9 percent from the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase is due primarily to acquisitions, expansions of communities, and increases in property tax rates. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $23.57 in 2000 compared to $22.39 in 1999, an increase of 5.3 percent. Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.  Administrative expense in 2000 was 4.8 percent of total revenues as compared to 5.2 percent in 1999.  Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2000 by $4,082,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase is attributed primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions and lending activities. Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding decreased to approximately 7.3 percent in 2000 from 7.4 percent in 1999.  Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $2,094,000 from the same period a year ago. The increase is directly attributed to acquisitions, expansions, and additions. Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in 2000 remained relatively unchanged from 1999.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Net cash provided by operating activities was $88.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $85.0 million for the same period in 2000. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to increases in net operating income, offset by the changes in operating assets and liabilities.  Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $371.1 million. In 2001, we purchased CWS Communities Trust ("CWS"), a private real estate investment trust for a net amount of approximately $320 million and three additional communities for $22.2 million in cash. We also sold seven properties and received net proceeds of $36.7 million in the latter part of 2001. Total investments in development, expansion, and property and equipment were $40.9 million in 2001 and we advanced $12.1 million on our notes receivables.  On August 3, 2001 we purchased CWS for $552 million, consisting of $323 million borrowed under a bridge facility, $151 million in assumed liabilities, 2,040,878 OP Units (valued for purposes of the transaction at $30.935 per OP Unit) and $9.9 million in 7.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2012 (the "August 2012 Notes"). The portfolio consisted of 46 manufactured home communities with approximately 16,600 homesites and approximately 1,500 expansion sites and three RV communities with 431 RV sites in 11 states. We financed the cash portion of this transaction primarily through borrowings of a $323 million bridge facility (the "Acquisition Facility"), which carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points, and matures August 2, 2002. In connection with this transaction, we agreed to issue in a private placement to the holders of the August 2012 Notes, an aggregate of 309,371 OP Units at $30.935 per OP Unit, in exchange for the issuance by such holders of 7.5% notes, due August 2010, subject to extension in certain events. These notes are collateralized by the related OP Units. We also acquired three other communities in 2001 for approximately $10 million in OP units and approximately $22 million in cash, which were financed primarily by borrowings under our lines of credit.                                         21    During 2001, we invested approximately $26 million in the expansion and development of our communities; resulting in the addition of approximately 350 available sites to our portfolio in 2002, and including finish costs on sites added previously and substantial progress on sites that will be added to our portfolio in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2001, recurring property capital expenditures, other than development costs, were approximately $7.2 million. Capital expenditures have historically been financed out of operating cash flow and it is our intention that such future expenditures will also be financed out of operating cash flow. In addition, during 2001, we advanced $12 million to non-affiliated entities that own or are developing manufactured home communities.  Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $282.1 million. This consisted primarily of the issuance of $150 million of debt and net borrowings under our Credit Facilities and the Acquisition Facility of $213.1 million. These were offset partially by $72.7 million in dividends and distributions paid to shareholders and OP Unitholders.  On October 23, 2001, we issued $150 million of 7.125% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2011 in a private placement. Net proceeds of $148.3 million were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Acquisition Facility. In connection with the private placement, we entered into a hedge of forecasted interest payments. We recorded a hedge loss of approximately $7.1 million in other comprehensive income and will amortize this into interest expense over the life of the debt.  In October 2001, we extended $50 million of our $70 million 7.54% senior unsecured notes scheduled to mature in November 2003 to October 2021 at 8.3%.  In addition to the Acquisition Facility, we have a $125 million line of credit arrangement with BankOne, NA acting as lead agent for a bank group to provide financing for future construction, acquisitions and general business obligations (the "BankOne Credit Facility"). The line of credit is unsecured, bears interest at the prime rate of interest or, at our option, LIBOR plus 90 basis points. The line is scheduled to mature in 2004. In addition, we have a $7.5 million unsecured line of credit from US Bank, which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points and matures in March 2002, which is under discussion for an extension, (the "US Bank Facility" and, together with the BankOne Credit Facility the "Credit Facilities"). As of December 31, 2001, approximately $125.1 million was outstanding under our Credit Facilities and we had $7.4 million available in additional borrowing capacity.  As of December 31, 2001, we had outstanding, in addition to the Credit Facilities, $470.0 million of unsecured senior debt with a weighted average interest rate and remaining maturity of 7.5 percent and 6.9 years, respectively, $285.6 million of secured mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate and remaining maturity of 7.6 percent and 7.5 years, respectively, and $163 million on our Acquisition Facility with an interest rate of 3.6 percent. As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately $1.1 billion of total debt outstanding, representing approximately 48.4 percent of our total market capitalization. All of the debt is fixed rate debt, other than our Credit Facilities and Acquisition Facility. The fixed rate debt carries a weighted average interest rate of 7.5 percent.  In the third quarter of 2001, we began implementing a disposition plan, identifying a number of properties that do not fit strategically with our overall investment portfolio, due to location, proximity to other properties, alternative investment opportunities or other factors. As of December 31, 2001, we had sold seven properties for approximately $42 million. The net proceeds from these sales, of approximately $37 million were used primarily to pay down the Acquisition Facility. Due to the timing of these sales, approximately $11 million was received in January of 2002. Since December 31, 2001, we have sold an additional three properties for approximately $6.2 million. The net proceeds were used to pay down the Acquisition Facility. As of March 15, 2002, we had $145.8 million outstanding under the Acquisition Facility and $22.4 million available under our Credit Facilities. We will continue to evaluate our properties and, depending on market conditions, expect to sell additional communities in 2002.                                         22    We expect to re-pay the balance of the Acquisition Facility, which matures in August of 2002, depending on current market conditions and capital availability factors, with proceeds from the disposition of properties, and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities.  Our principal long term liquidity needs include: repayment of long-term borrowings and amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the Acquisition Facility, future acquisitions of communities and land for development, and new and existing community development activities. We do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to finance these long-term liquidity needs and instead intend to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through additional borrowing under the Credit Facilities or other lines of credit, the assumption of existing secured or unsecured indebtedness and, depending on market conditions and capital availability factors, the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.  We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including expansion activities and capital expenditure requirements, through cash flow from operations and, if necessary, and depending on our operating performance, borrowings under the Credit Facilities and other lines of credit.  The following is a summary of our aggregate commitments, in millions, as of December 31, 2001:                                                             Payments Due by Period                       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    Contractual                       Less than 1    Obligations            Total         year          1 - 3 years    4 - 5 years    After 5 years - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            Fixed Rate Debt             $766           $  6       $190             $121               $449 Variable Rate Debt           288            167        121                -                  -                                                Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------                            Total Other Commercial          Amounts    Less than 1   Commitments            Committed      year          1 - 3 years    4 - 5 years    After 5 years - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            Lines of Credit           $132.5           $7.5       $125                -                     - Guarantees                  48.4             (1)        (1)              (1)                   (1)        (1)   These guarantees expire at various times.  The financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio and a restriction on the incurrence of additional collateralized indebtedness without a corresponding increase in rental property. We were out of compliance on one of our covenants as of December 31, 2001 associated with both our BankOne Credit Facility and the Acquisition Facility. Also, in February 2002, we were out of compliance on another of our covenants under both agreements that limit the amount of variable rate debt outstanding. In February 2002, we received waivers from the lenders and amended the agreements to change the covenant for the remaining term of the Acquisition Facility and until March 2003 for the Credit Facility.  In March 2002, Moody's Investor Service lowered our debt rating to Baa3 from Baa2. The reason for the change was due to a weaker capital structure and coverage ratios since completing the CWS acquisition. Standard and Poors has not changed its rating of BBB. In the event that our debt rating is lowered again, it may have an impact on the cost of our debt.  We currently own approximately 10 percent of N'Tandem's outstanding stock and account for our investment utilizing the equity method of accounting. We also recognize income from a property management agreement, an advisory agreement, overhead reimbursements and interest income on advances as earned. The amount of fee income and interest income earned is outlined in the table below.                                         23                                              2001         2000         1999                                        ---------    ---------    --------- Interest income and related fees       $   3,345    $   3,165    $   1,914 Transaction fees                             522        2,530        1,055 Advisory fees                              1,335          777          346 Management and overhead fees               1,935        1,303        1,217                                           ------    ---------    ---------                                        $   7,137    $   7,775    $   4,532                                           ======    =========    =========  Interest is earned on the loan to N'Tandem (Prime plus one percent, or 5.75 percent at December 31, 2001) and includes fees paid by N'Tandem for the subordination of our loan to the N'Tandem bank debt ($730,000 in both 2001 and 2000). The transaction fees are related to acquisition services provided by us to N'Tandem and are calculated as three percent of the acquisition price. The advisory fees are charged based on one percent of N'Tandem's average assets. The management fees are charged based on five percent of revenues of properties managed by us on behalf of N'Tandem. Overhead reimbursement fees are based on a fixed fee per site. We expect to receive modest increases on the recurring fees due to increases in expected revenues and sites. However, as the non-recurring fees are subject to the completion of a transaction, these are difficult to predict.  N'Tandem currently has net losses of approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and also has experienced negative cash flows from operations. We serve as a guarantor on N'Tandem's $20 million line of credit. We do not have any agreements to fund future operating losses of N'Tandem, however our ability to recover our fees charged to N'Tandem and our loans and advances to N'Tandem is dependent on the ultimate sale of the N'Tandem properties. N'Tandem will likely continue to generate negative cash flow from operations in the near term. We believe that based on current market conditions the loans and advances to N'Tandem, which totaled approximately $33 million at December 31, 2001, will be recovered from the ultimate sale of the properties.  The following table summarizes certain financial information for N'Tandem for the years ending December 31, 2001 and 2000.                                                         2001           2000                                                    -------------------------         Total revenues                              $  23,066      $   10,487        Operating and administrative expenses          14,103           5,986        Interest expense                               11,744           7,287        Depreciation expense                            5,555           2,623        Preferred dividends                               110             110                                                    -------------------------        Net loss                                    $  (8,446)     $   (5,519)                                                    -------------------------         Rental property                             $ 128,941      $  127,291        Total assets                                $ 134,009      $  132,678        Amounts due to the Company                  $  33,348      $   32,120        Other debt                                  $ 109,675      $  102,216        Shareholders' deficit                       $ (27,892)     $  (10,474)                                         24    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies that both require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported on our consolidated financial statements.       .    When we acquire real estate properties, we allocate the components of           these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using our           estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions impact the           amount of costs allocated between land and different categories of           land improvements as well as the amount of costs assigned to           individual properties in multiple property acquisitions. These           allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or losses           recorded on future sales of properties.       .    We recognize an impairment loss on a real estate asset to be held and           used in operations if the asset's undiscounted expected future cash           flows are less than its depreciated cost. We compute a real estate           assets undiscounted expected future cash flow using certain estimates           and assumptions.       .    We use two different accounting methods to report our investments in           entities: the consolidation method and the equity method. We use the           consolidation method when we own most of the outstanding voting           interests in an entity and/or can control its operations. We use the           equity method of accounting when we own an interest in an entity and           can exert significant influence over the entity's operations but           cannot control the entity's operations. We review these investments           regularly for possible impairment using certain estimates and           assumptions regarding undiscounted expected future cash flows. We also           review these investments regularly for proper accounting treatment.           However, a key factor in this review, the determination of whether or           not we can control or exert significant influence over an entity's           operations, is subjective in nature.       .    We report receivables net of an allowance for receivables that may be           uncollectible in the future. We review our receivables regularly for           potential collection problems in computing the allowance recorded           against our receivables; this review process requires we make certain           judgments regarding collections that are inherently difficult to           predict.       .    Collectibility of advances to N'Tandem and other Notes Receivable is           based on the determination of the fair market value of the properties           and the related net proceeds from the ultimate liquidation of the           properties.  Inflation  All of the leases or terms of tenants' occupancies at the communities allow for at least annual rental adjustments. In addition, all leases are short-term (generally one year or less) and enable us to seek market rentals upon reletting the sites. Such leases generally minimize the risk to us of any adverse effect of inflation.                                         25    Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations to be accounted for by the purchase method and defines criteria under which intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 141 is effective for all fiscal business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 changes the useful life of goodwill recorded on a company's books from 40 years to indefinite and requires goodwill to be reviewed annually for impairment. SFAS No. 142 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of SFAS No. 141 and No. 142 did not have and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.  In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment on Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and provides guidance for measuring the amount of impairment. SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. As individual properties to be sold qualify as components of an entity, properties classified as held for sale or sold in a reporting period will be treated as discontinued operations for reporting purposes. The statement of income will reflect the properties' results of operations, including any gains or losses recognized, as a separate component in the income statement.  Other  Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as consolidated net income without giving effect to gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property and rental property depreciation and amortization. Management believes that FFO is an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of REITs, which provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; (iii) is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity; and (iv) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. FFO is calculated as follows:                                                   For the Year Ended December 31, (In thousands)                                    2001       2000        1999                                                ---------  ---------   ----------  Income before minority interests               $  36,118  $  48,722   $  44,962 Less:    Income allocated to Preferred OP Units          6,094      6,094       6,094 Plus:    Depreciation of rental property                56,804     43,289      41,161    Amortization of intangibles                         -          -         405    Impairment / (gain) on sales of properties      1,503          -      (2,805)                                                ---------  ---------   ---------- Funds from operations                          $  88,331  $  85,917   $  77,629                                                =========  =========   ==========  Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - -------   ----------------------------------------------------------  Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. Management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed-rate, long-term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level and (2) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. As of December 31, 2001, our Credit and Acquisition Facilities represented our only variable rate debt.                                         26    The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2001, concerning our debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("FV"):                                                               For the Year Ended December 31,                                 2002      2003        2004         2005       2006     Thereafter       Total          FV                   Debt obligations    Fixed rate                  5,617     76,177      113,894      109,615     11,644     448,645      $  765,592      788,914    Average interest rate         7.7%       7.8%         7.1%         8.5%       8.1%        7.5%    Variable rate             166,844                 121,000                                          $  287,844      287,844    Average interest rate         3.4%                    3.0%  Total debt                  172,461     76,177      234,894      109,615     11,644     448,645       1,053,436    1,076,758   We face market risk relating to our fixed-rate debt upon re-financing of such debt and depending upon prevailing interest rates at the time of such re-finance. As a result of our successful re-financing and extension of our fixed-rate debt, as illustrated in the above chart, we will not need to re-finance any of our fixed-rate debt until 2003. Our Acquisition Facility matures in August of 2002. We expect to re-pay the balance, depending on current market conditions and capital availability factors, with proceeds from the disposition of properties, a bank term loan, or the issuance of additional debt or equity securities.  In addition, we have assessed the market risk for our variable rate debt and believe that a 1% increase in LIBOR rates would result in an approximate $2.9 million increase in interest expense based on $287.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2001.  The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.                                         27    Item 8.
