Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and             Results of Operations  Introduction           HTCC was  organized  on March  23,  1992  and was a  development  stage enterprise  through March 31, 1995. The Company is now engaged  primarily in the provision   of   telecommunications    services   through   its   majority-owned subsidiaries,  Raba-Com, KNC, Papatel and Hungarotel.  During 1996 and 1997, the Company embarked on a significant  network  development program designed to meet its substantial  demand backlog,  increase the number of basic telephone  access lines in service and modernize existing facilities. Since commencing operations, the  Company's  network  upgrade  and  expansion  program  has  resulted  in the modernization   of   facilities   acquired   from  MATAV  and  the  addition  of approximately  113,700  access  lines  through  December  31, 1997 to the 61,400 access lines purchased from MATAV.  As a result,  the Company had 175,100 access lines in operation at year end 1997.                                        -27-            From 1994 to 1996,  the Company  devoted a  substantial  portion of its efforts to obtaining concession rights,  negotiating acquisitions,  raising debt and equity financing, assembling a management team and commencing operations. As a result,  the Company  recognized no revenue until 1995 and incurred  aggregate net losses of approximately $117.2 million through December 31, 1997.           Since the quarter  ended  March 31,  1995,  the  Company  has  provided telecommunications  services in the  Raba-Com  and KNC  Operating  Areas.  As of January 1, 1996, the Company commenced providing  telecommunications services in the Papatel and Hungarotel  Operating Areas. The development and installation of the network in each of the Company's  Operating  Areas has required  significant capital  expenditures.  These expenditures,  together with associated  operating expenses,  have resulted in substantial cash requirements  until a customer base large  enough  to  provide  sufficient  revenues  and  operating  cash  flow  is established.  The  ability of the  Company to  generate  sufficient  revenues to satisfy cash  requirements  and become  profitable  will depend upon a number of factors,  including  the  Company's  ability  to attract  additional  customers, revenues per customer and construction  costs.  These factors are expected to be primarily  influenced  by the success of the  Company's  operating and marketing strategies as well as market  acceptance of  telecommunications  services in the Company's  Operating  Areas.  In addition,  the Company's  profitability  may be affected by changes in the Company's  regulatory  environment  and other factors that are beyond the Company's control.           The success of the Company's  strategy is dependent upon its ability to increase  revenues through the addition of new subscribers while limiting churn. Since March 31, 1995, the Company's  network  construction and expansion program has added 113,700  access lines  through  December 31, 1997 to the 61,400 access lines  acquired  directly  from MATAV.  During this same period,  churn has been negligible, primarily due to the Company's exclusivity rights and the demand for services evidenced by the number of wait-listed subscribers.  Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 1997 to Year Ended December 31, 1996         Net Revenues                                                               Year ended                (dollars in millions)                              1997        1996         Measured service revenues                        $ 26.2      $ 20.5         Subscription revenues                               7.2         3.8         Net interconnect charges                          (10.2)       (8.9)                                                          ------      ------         Net measured service and subscription revenues     23.2        15.4         Connection fees                                    12.9         4.1         Other operating revenues, net                       1.8         1.4                                                          ------      ------         Telephone Service Revenues, Net                  $ 37.9     $  20.9                                                          ======     =======            The  Company  recorded  an  81.3%  increase  in net  telephone  service revenues  to $37.9  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  1997 from $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.                                         -28-            Net measured service and subscription revenues increased 50.7% to $23.2 million for the year ended  December  31,  1997 from $15.4  million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  Measured  service  revenues  increased  27.8% to $26.2 million in 1997 from $20.5 million in 1996 while subscription revenues increased 89.5% to $7.2 million in 1997 from $3.8 million in 1996. These increases in call and subscription fee revenues are the result of a 74% increase in average access lines in service from approximately 76,000 lines for the year ended December 31, 1996 to  approximately  132,000 lines for the year ended  December 31, 1997. The growth in access  lines is not fully  reflected in  increased  measured  service revenues  as newer  customers  require a period  of  maturity  before  producing revenues similar to established telephone customers. In addition,  approximately 28,000 lines,  representing  35% of the total  increase in access lines in 1997, were placed in service during the fourth quarter of 1997.           These  revenues  have been  offset by net  interconnect  charges  which totalled  $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to $8.9 million  for the year ended  December  31,  1996.  As a  percentage  of call and subscription  revenues,  net interconnect charges have declined from 37% for the year ended December 31, 1996 to 31% for the year ended December 31, 1997, due to a higher  proportion of local  traffic as additional  access lines are placed in service.           Connection  fees for the year ended  December  31, 1997  totaled  $12.9 million as compared to $4.1 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  This increase reflects the Company's ongoing network  construction  which resulted in the connection of 81,700 access lines during the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the connection of 28,200 access lines during the year ended December 31, 1996.  As the majority of  wait-listed  customers  have been  provided  with access lines,  connection  fees will decline  substantially.  This  reduction in connection  fee revenues is expected to be partially  offset by increases in net measured  service  and  subscription  revenues  resulting  from 1997 access line connections.           Other  operating  revenues  increased  28.6% to $1.8 million during the year ended  December  31, 1997  compared to $1.4  million  during the year ended December 31, 1996 due to higher  revenues  from the  provision of direct  lines, telephone leasing, PBX and telephone sales.       Operating and Maintenance Expenses           Operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased to $25.0 million compared to $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1996. On a per line basis,  operating and maintenance  expenses decreased to approximately  $190 per average access line for the year ended December 31, 1997 from  $285  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1996 as the  Company  achieved productivity improvements, including the decreased use of labor intensive manual switchboards and the increased use of modern switching technology.       Depreciation and Amortization           Depreciation and amortization charges increased to $8.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from $4.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996. This increase was due to the substantial  increase in property,  plant and equipment  placed in  service  in 1997 as a result of the  network  construction program.                                        -29-        Management Fees           Management fees pursuant to management service agreements  decreased to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  This decrease was due primarily to the  termination of certain management agreements with Tele Danmark in August 1996. See "- Liquidity and Capital  Resources,"  and Notes 1(a),  9(f) and 14 of Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements.       Asset Write-downs           During the year ended  December 31, 1996,  the Company  recorded  asset write-downs  totaling $2.0 million,  which represented the  decommissioning  and write-off of redundant assets as a result of the network construction in 1996.       Cost of Termination of Former Officers and Directors           During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company  recorded a charge totaling $6.3 million representing the present value of payments due and options granted to former  executive  officers and directors under separate  termination and release agreements, consulting agreements and noncompetition agreements.       Loss from Operations           Loss from  operations  decreased  to $1.3  million  for the year  ended December  31,  1997 from a loss from  operations  of $20.6  million for the year ended  December  31,  1996.  Adjusted  for  asset  write-downs  and the  cost of termination of former officers and directors,  the loss from operations  totaled $12.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  The  decreasing  operating loss in 1997 was  principally  due to the  additional  revenue  generated by the network  development  program,  offset by increases in operating and maintenance and depreciation expenses.       Foreign Exchange Loss           Foreign  exchange  losses  decreased to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $6.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  Such foreign  exchange losses  resulted from the devaluation of the Hungarian  Forint against  the U.S.  Dollar and the  German  Mark.  The  decrease  in the  foreign exchange  loss is due to a significant  reduction in debt and other  obligations denominated in U.S. Dollars and German Marks.       Interest Expense           Interest expense increased to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  This increase was  attributable  to higher  average debt levels during the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 as the Company incurred additional   indebtedness   in  order  to  continue  the   construction  of  its telecommunications  networks.  Interest  capitalized and included in the cost of construction of certain long term assets amounted to approximately  $4.5 million during 1997 and $2.1 million in 1996.           Included  in  interest  expense in 1996 is $4.9  million,  the value of consideration  provided to Citizens for  assistance in fulfilling  the Company's obligations under the Citicorp Credit Facility (as defined herein).  See Notes 5 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                        -30-        Interest Income           Interest  income  decreased to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $1.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  This decrease is due to decreased average cash balances outstanding during 1997.       Abandonment of Financing           During  the year ended  1996,  the  Company  cancelled  a planned  bond offering in favor of a Hungarian Bank Credit Facility.  The costs of abandonment of financing  were $3.0 million and included  $2.0 million in settlement of fees and costs of the underwriter and $1.0 million for professional  fees and various out of pocket expenses.       Other, net           Other,  net income decreased to $13,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 principally due to a decrease in non-operating income and ancillary services.       Loss Before Extraordinary Items           As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company recorded a loss before extraordinary items of $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 compared  to a loss  before  extraordinary  items of $47.5  million for the year ended December 31, 1996.       Extraordinary Item           The Company did not record any extraordinary  items in 1997 as compared to the year ended  December  31,  1996,  during  which the  Company  recorded an extraordinary  item of $7.3  million  comprised  of a  non-cash  charge  of $8.2 million related to the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs pertaining to the Citizens Loan Agreements, offset by extraordinary income of $0.9  million  relating  to a gain on early  retirement  of a  vendor  credit facility. See Notes 5 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       Net Loss           As a result of the factors  discussed above, the Company recorded a net loss of $36.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 as compared to a net loss of $54.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.                                         -31-    Comparison  of Year Ended  December  31,  1996 to Year Ended  December  31, 1995         Net Revenues                                                                           Year ended                       (dollars in millions)                                1996        1995                Measured service revenues                          $ 20.5         $ 3.8                Subscription revenues                                 3.8           0.7                Net interconnect charges                             (8.9)         (1.7)                                                                  --------      -------                Net measured service and subscription revenues       15.4           2.8                Connection fees                                       4.1           1.0                Other operating revenues                              1.4           0.3                                                                  -------       -------                Telephone Service Revenues, Net                    $ 20.9         $ 4.1                                                                  =======       =======            The Company  recorded an increase in net telephone  service revenues to $20.9  million for the year ended  December  31, 1996 from $4.1  million for the year ended December 31, 1995.           Net  measured  service and  subscription  revenues  increased  to $15.4 million  for the year ended  December  31,  1996 from $2.8  million for the year ended December 31, 1995. Measured service revenues increased to $20.5 million in 1996 from $3.8  million in 1995 while  subscription  revenues  increased to $3.8 million  in 1996  from  $0.7  million  in  1995.  These  increases  in call  and subscription fee revenues were the result of an increase in average access lines in service from approximately  14,000 lines for the year ended December 31, 1995 to  approximately  76,000  lines  for the year  ended  December  31,  1996.  The principal  reason for this  significant  increase  in lines was the  addition of approximately  44,000  lines in the  Hungarotel  and  Papatel  areas  which were acquired from MATAV on December 31, 1995.           These  revenues were offset by net  interconnect  charges which totaled $8.9  million for the year ended  December  31, 1996 as compared to $1.7 million for the year ended  December 31, 1995. As a percentage of call and  subscription revenues, net interconnect charges declined slightly from 38% for the year ended December 31, 1995 to 37% for the year ended December 31, 1996.           Connection  fees for the year ended  December  31,  1996  totaled  $4.1 million as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  This increase reflects the Company's network  construction  program which resulted in the connection of 28,200 access lines during the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared to the connection of 3,800  subscribers  during the year ended December 31, 1995.           The Company  recorded other operating  revenues of $1.4 million for the year ended  December  31, 1996 as compared to other  operating  revenues of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. This increase reflects  additional revenues  from the provision of direct  lines,  telephone  leasing and telephone sales.                                        -32-        Operating and Maintenance Expenses           Operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased  $7.1  million to $22.0  million as compared to $14.9  million for the year ended December 31, 1995. The $14.9 million of operating  expenses  incurred in the year ended  December 31, 1995 included  non-cash  charges  totalling $6.4 million  relating to deferred  stock  compensation.  Included in  operating  and maintenance  expenses for the year ended  December  31, 1996 was deferred  stock compensation of $0.4.  Operating and maintenance expenses adjusted to remove the effect of the  deferred  stock  compensation  totalled  $21.6  million  and $8.5 million  for the  years  ended  December  31,  1996 and 1995,  respectively,  an increase of $13.1  million,  or 154%.  The  increase in adjusted  operating  and maintenance  expenses  resulted  primarily  from the  inclusion of operating and maintenance  expenses of Hungarotel and Papatel.  On a per line basis,  adjusted operating and maintenance  expenses  decreased to approximately $285 per average access  line for the year ended  December  31, 1996 from $620 for the year ended December 31, 1995 as the Company achieved productivity  improvements,  including the decreased use of labor intensive  manual  switchboards and the increased use of modern switching technology.       Depreciation and Amortization           Depreciation and amortization charges increased to $4.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996 from $2.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1995.  This  increase  was due to the  increase  in plant  and  access  lines in operation during the year ended December 31, 1996.       Management Fees           Management fees pursuant to management service agreements  increased to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase is primarily due to a full year of monthly management  fees due to Citizens  which  commenced  July 1, 1995,  offset by the expiration in the third  quarter of 1996 of the  management  services  agreement between  the  Company  and Tele  Danmark.  See  Notes  13(c)  and 14 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  "- Liquidity and Capital  Resources,"  and Notes 1(a), 9(f) and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       Asset Write-downs           Asset write-downs increased to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 from $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. This was due to the decommissioning and write-off of redundant assets as a result of the network construction in 1996.       Cost of Termination of Former Officers and Directors           For the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company  recorded a charge of $6.3 million  representing the present value of payments due and options granted to  former  officers  and  directors  under  separate  termination  and  release agreements,  consulting agreements and noncompetition agreements. See Note 13(a) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement.       Loss from Operations           Loss from  operations  increased  to $20.6  million  for the year ended December 31, 1996 from $17.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 1995.  The operating loss for the year ended December 31, 1996 was  principally  due to the costs of termination of certain former officers and directors as noted above and to the additional  expenses incurred by the Company to expand management project oversight,  engineering  design and systems  needed to achieve rapid line growth and  revenue  increases,  and provide  for the  introduction  and control of new services.                                        -33-        Foreign Exchange Losses           Foreign  exchange  losses  increased to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 from $4.1 million for the year ended  December 31, 1995.  Such foreign  exchange losses  resulted from the devaluation of the Hungarian  Forint against the U.S. Dollar and the German Mark. The Company incurred debt and other obligations  which were denominated in U.S. Dollars and German Marks in order to commence the  construction of its  telecommunication  networks.  During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Hungarian  Forint devalued  against the U.S. Dollar and the German  Mark by 18.4% and 9.0%,  respectively,  as compared to 26.0% and 36.3% during the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase in foreign  exchange loss was  primarily  attributable  to the  repayment in 1996 of U.S.  Dollar and German Mark  denominated  intercompany  loans  resulting  in a realized  foreign exchange  loss in the operating  subsidiaries.  The loss was offset by a reduced devaluation of the Hungarian  Forint during 1996 as well as the repayment of the German Mark denominated vendor credit facility. Since the substantial portion of the  liabilities  within the  operating  companies  are now  denominated  in the Hungarian   Forint,   the  Company's  foreign  currency  losses  have  decreased significantly.       Interest Expense           Interest expense increased to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 from $1.7 million for the year ended  December 31, 1995.  This increase was  attributable  to higher  average debt levels in the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared  to the year ended  December  31, 1995 as the Company  incurred indebtedness  in order to continue the  construction  of its  telecommunications networks.  These interest  expenses were offset by capitalized  interest of $2.1 million in 1996 and $0.5 million in 1995.       Included in interest  expense is $4.9 million,  the value of  consideration provided to Citizens for  assistance  in fulfilling  the  Company's  obligations under the Citicorp  Credit Facility (as defined  herein).  See Notes 5 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement.       Interest Income           Interest  income  increased  $0.5  million to $1.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996 from $1.0 million for the year ended  December 31, 1995 primarily due to higher available cash reserves for short term investment.       Abandonment of Financing           During 1996 the Company cancelled a planned bond offering in favor of a Hungarian Bank Credit Facility.  The costs of abandonment of financing were $3.0 million  and  included  $2.0  million  in  settlement  of fees and  costs of the underwriter  and $1.0  million for  professional  fees and various out of pocket expenses.       Other, net           Other,  net  increased  from net  charges of $0.3  million for the year ended  December  31,  1995 to net  income  of $1.1  million  for the year  ended December  31,  1996  principally  due  to  non-operating  income  and  ancillary services.                                        -34-      Loss Before Extraordinary Items           As a result of the factors discussed above, for the year ended December 31,  1996,  the  Company  recorded a loss  before  extraordinary  items of $47.5 million  compared  to a loss of $20.0  million for the year ended  December  31, 1995.     Extraordinary Item           For  the  year  ended  December  31,  1996,  the  Company  recorded  an extraordinary  item of $7.3  million  comprised  of a  non-cash  charge  of $8.2 million related to the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs   pertaining  to  the  Citizens  Loan   Agreements,   offset  in  part  by extraordinary income of $0.9 million relating to a gain on early retirement of a vendor credit  facility.  See Notes 5 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statement.     Net Loss           As a result of the factors  discussed above the Company  recorded a net loss of $54.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996 as compared to a net loss of $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1995.  Liquidity and Capital Resources           The Company was  considered a development  stage company  through March 31, 1995. It has historically funded its capital requirements  primarily through a combination of debt, equity and vendor financing.  The ongoing development and installation  of the network in each of the Company's  Operating  Areas requires significant capital expenditures.  These expenditures,  together with associated operating expenses,  will continue to result in substantial cash requirements at least until a customer  base large  enough to provide  sufficient  revenues  and operating cash flow is established.           In 1995 the Company  entered into a financing  agreement  with Citizens pursuant to which Citizens guaranteed a $33.2 million loan from Chemical Bank in November  1995.  During  February  and March 1996,  the Company  borrowed  $18.2 million under a second financing agreement with Citizens.           On March 29, 1996,  the Company  entered into a $75.0  million  Secured Term Loan Credit Facility (the "Citicorp  Credit  Facility") and,  together with HTCC  Consulting,  a related  Pledge and Security  Agreement with Citicorp North America,  Inc.  ("Citicorp").  On April 3, 1996,  the Company used $50.8 million from the Citicorp  Credit Facility to repay all the funds advanced or guaranteed by  Citizens  and  Chemical  Bank.  As of such date,  all loan  agreements  with Citizens and Chemical  Bank were  terminated.  Accordingly,  in April 1996,  the Company  incurred a non-cash charge of approximately  $8.2 million  representing the  remaining  unamortized  deferred  financing  costs  pertaining  to the loan agreements with Citizens.           In order  to meet  contractual  commitments  pursuant  to  construction contracts  in  addition  to ongoing  operating  expenses,  the  Company  used an additional $24.0 million from the Citicorp Credit Facility.                                        -35-            On October 15, 1996,  the Company  entered into a $170 million  10-year Multi-Currency  Credit  Facility  with  Postabank.  Proceeds  from the Postabank Credit Facility may be drawn entirely in Hungarian  Forints and up to 20% of the principal  may be drawn in U.S.  Dollars  through  March 31, 1999.  Drawdowns in Hungarian Forints bear interest at a rate of 2.5% above the average of the yield on six- and twelve-month  discounted Hungarian treasury bills while drawdowns in U.S. Dollars bear interest at 2.5% above LIBOR. Interest for the first two years has been  deferred at the Company's  option.  Amounts  outstanding  in Hungarian Forints,  including  any deferred  interest,  are payable in 32 equal  quarterly installments  beginning on March 31, 1999.  Amounts  outstanding in U.S. Dollars are payable in equal quarterly installments through December 31, 2002.           In October 1996,  the Company  borrowed the equivalent of $82.3 million in Hungarian  Forints under the Postabank Credit Facility.  Approximately  $75.2 million of this amount was used to repay Citicorp all funds advanced pursuant to the Citicorp  Credit  Facility,  as amended,  and $2.0 million in fees and costs representing  settlement in connection  with the  cancellation  of the Company's proposed private  placement of debt  securities.  The remaining $5.1 million was used to pay management fees and reimbursable  costs owed to Citizens pursuant to the Management  Services Agreement with Citizens.  An additional $5.6 million of the facility was used to pay loan  origination fees and costs to Postabank under the terms of the loan agreement, $2 million of which are being reimbursed to the Company in equal quarterly  installments over a two year period,  and which will be amortized over the life of the loan  facility.  The remainder of the proceeds have  been  and  will  be  used  to  complete   construction  of  the  Company's telecommunication networks, provide additional working capital, and refinance or repay other existing debt obligations.  As of December 31, 1997, the Company had borrowed a total of $154 million under the Postabank Credit Facility.           In 1996,  the  Company's  subsidiary  Hungarotel  entered  into a $47.5 million construction contract for the construction of a telephone network with a capacity of 40,000 lines in its  Bekescsaba  service  area.  Financing  has been provided by the contractor for the full contract amount. The financing agreement requires  repayment in 20 quarterly  installments  commencing on March 31, 1998, with final payment due December 31, 2002. Interest is charged at a variable rate computed  as the  weighted  average of the six and 12 month  Hungarian  National Treasury Bill  interest rate for each quarter plus 2.5%.  The Company may elect, and has elected,  to defer  repayment of 20% of the total debt repayments due in 1998 and 1999.           In 1995, the Company  applied for network  construction  subsidies from the  Hungarian   government.   In  December  1995,   certain  of  the  Company's applications  were  approved,  subject to certain  conditions,  resulting in the Company being awarded subsidies  aggregating $0.9 million.  The Company received such  subsidies  in  installments  in the  fourth  quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997.  One-half of such funds will be received in the form of a grant and one-half in the form of a  non-interest  bearing loan repayable over a three year period.           Net cash provided by operating  activities totaled $4.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 compared to net cash used by operating  activities of $35.8  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  1996.  For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company used $73.3 million in investing activities, which was primarily used to fund the construction of the Company's  telecommunications networks,  compared to $56.4 million in investing  activities for the year ended December 31, 1996.  Financing  activities provided net cash of $58.4 million and $89.2 million for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.                                        -36-            To date, the Company's  activities have involved the acquisition of the concessions  and  telecommunications  networks  from  MATAV  and the  subsequent design,   development  and   construction   of  the  modern   telecommunications infrastructure  that the Company now has in  service.  The Company has  suffered from recurring losses from operations and has a working capital deficiency and a net capital deficiency. The Company is dependent on its ability to generate cash from  operations,  raise capital in the form of debt or equity,  or refinance or otherwise  resolve its  existing  obligations,  including  those  related to the Management  Services  Agreement  with  Citizens.  The  ability of the Company to generate  sufficient revenues to satisfy cash requirements and become profitable will depend upon a number of factors, including the Company's ability to attract additional customers and revenues per customer. These factors are expected to be primarily  influenced  by the success of the  Company's  operating and marketing strategies as well as market acceptance of the Company's services.           Through December 31, 1997, the Company was in the construction phase of its  development.  The Company paid the Ministry  $11.5  million (at  historical exchange  rates) for its  concessions,  spent  approximately  $23.2  million (at historical exchange rates) to acquire the existing  telecommunications assets in its Operating Areas from MATAV,  and spent $155 million (at historical  exchange rates) to complete  its network  modernization  and  construction  program.  The Company anticipates that with the construction phase of its network complete, it will  spend  approximately  $16  million  in 1998 and $7  million  after 1998 to complete the network expansion so that the Company will be able to provide basic telephone services to all of the estimated 266,600 homes and 38,900 business and other institutional  subscribers (including government  institutions) within its Operating Areas.           With the construction  phase of its development  complete,  the Company intends  to  transform  itself  from a  construction  driven  organization  to a marketing driven operationally  efficient organization in 1998. To that end, the Company recently hired Francis J. Busacca,  Jr. as its Chief Financial  Officer. In addition,  James G. Morrison,  HTCC's President and Chief Executive  Officer, who was instrumental in overseeing the Company's network construction program is retiring  effective May 1, 1998. David A. Finley, the Chairman of the Company is leading  an  Executive  Search  Committee  of the Board in its  search for a new President and Chief Executive Officer.           The  Company  and  Citizens  presently  have a  disagreement  regarding certain issues with respect to the Management  Services Agreement with Citizens. As of December 31, 1997, the Company has accrued as a current liability, but not paid, $7.2 million pursuant to the Management  Services  Agreement.  The Company currently  intends to withhold  any  payments to  Citizens  with  respect to the Management Services Agreement until such time as these issues are resolved.  The Company is currently in discussions with Citizens in an attempt to resolve these issues.  The Company and Citizens  also have a  disagreement  regarding  certain issues with respect to 1.9 million  shares of Common Stock  subject to Citizens' preemptive  rights to date. The Company is also  currently in  discussions  with Citizens in an attempt to resolve these issues.                                        -37-            The Company  believes it will be able to meet its  obligations  as they become  due during  1998,  provided  it is not  required  to settle the  accrued liability to Citizens in cash, however, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Additionally, funding for the Company's future capital requirements to repay  existing  debt  obligations  after 1998 may require the sale of equity and/or debt of the Company or one or more of the Operating Companies.  There can be no  assurance  that such  financing  will be  available  to the Company  when needed,  on commercially  reasonable  terms, or at all. The Company is, however, reviewing  its options with respect to  refinancing  its existing  credit and/or vendor  facilities.  The  Company  is also  reviewing  various  other  financing alternatives with its financial advisors.           These factors raise  substantial  doubt about the Company's  ability to continue  as a going  concern.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.           The Company has granted  various  warrants  and options to purchase the Company's Common Stock,  including those previously granted to Citizens, and has provided certain  preemptive rights to Citizens.  For the term of these warrants and options,  the holders will have the  opportunity  to exercise and dilute the interests  of other  security  holders  or, in the case of  Citizens,  acquire a controlling  interest  in the  Company.  As long as these  warrants  and options remain   unexercised,   and   dependent   upon  the  outcome  of  the  Company's disagreements  with Citizens,  the Company's ability to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected.  Inflation and Foreign Currency           For the  year  ended  December  31,  1997,  inflation  in  Hungary  was approximately  18.6% on an annualized basis. It is the stated policy goal of the Hungarian government to keep inflation from exceeding approximately 15% in 1998.           The  Company's  Hungarian  operations  generate  revenues in  Hungarian Forints and incur operating and other expenses,  including capital expenditures, in Hungarian  Forints,  U.S.  Dollars and German Deutsche  Marks.  The Company's resulting  foreign  currency  exposure  cannot be practically  hedged due to the significant  costs  involved  and the lack of a  market  for  such  hedging.  In addition,  certain of the  Company's  balance  sheet  accounts are  expressed in foreign  currencies other than the Hungarian  Forint,  the Company's  functional currency.  Accordingly, when such accounts are converted into Hungarian Forints, the Company is subject to foreign  exchange gains and losses which are reflected as a component  of net income or loss.  When the  Company and its  subsidiaries' Forint-denominated  accounts  are  translated  into U.S.  Dollars for  financial reporting  purposes,  the  Company is subject to  translation  adjustments,  the effect of which is reflected in a component of stockholders' deficit.           While the Company has the ability to increase the prices it charges for its services  commensurate with increases in the Hungarian  Consumer Price Index ("CPI")  pursuant to its licenses from the Hungarian  government,  it may choose not to implement the full amount of the increase  permitted  due to  competitive and other concerns.  In addition,  the rate of increase in the Hungarian CPI may be less than the rate at which the Hungarian Forint devalues.  As a result,  the Company may be unable to generate cash flows to the degree necessary to meet its obligation in currencies other than the Hungarian Forint.  Year 2000           The Company  recently  formed a committee to begin,  possibly  with the assistance  of outside  consultants,  an  evaluation of its network and computer systems  for Year  2000  compliance.  The Year  2000  problem  is the  result of computer  programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year. Any of the Company's programs that have time-sensitive software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could result in a major system failure or miscalculations  causing disruption of operations.                                        -38-            Following the Company's  evaluation of its network and computer systems for Year 2000  compliance,  the Company  expects to adopt a plan to mitigate the Year 2000 Issue.  While the extent and total cost of the Year 2000 modifications and  conversions has not yet been  determined,  the Company  presently  believes that, with  modifications  to existing  software and converting to new software, the Year 2000 problem  will not pose  significant  operational  problems for the Company's  networks and systems as so modified and converted.  However,  if such modifications  and conversions are not completed  timely,  the Year 2000 problem may have a material impact on the operations of the Company.  Prospective Accounting Pronouncements           Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 130 ("SFAS  130"), "Reporting   Comprehensive   Income,"  and  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 131 ("SFAS 131"), "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related  Information," were issued in June 1997. SFAS 130 establishes  standards for reporting and display of  comprehensive  income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial  statements.  This statement  requires that all items  that  are  required  to  be  recognized  under  accounting  standards  as components  of  comprehensive  income,  such as  foreign  currency  fluctuations currently reported in stockholder's equity, be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial  statements.  SFAS 131 establishes  standards for the way public companies report information about operating  segments  in annual  financial  statements  and  requires  that these companies  report  selected  information  about  operating  segments  in interim financial  reports issued to  shareholders.  It also  establishes  standards for related  disclosures  about  products and services,  geographic  areas and major customers.  The  Company is required  to adopt both new  standards  in the first quarter of 1998.                 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
