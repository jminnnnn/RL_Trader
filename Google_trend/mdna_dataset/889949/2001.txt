Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations  Introduction           The Company is engaged primarily in the provision of telecommunications services  through  its  operating  subsidiaries,   KNC,  Raba-Com,  Papatel  and Hungarotel.  The  Company  earns  substantially  all of  its  telecommunications revenue from measured service fees,  monthly line rental fees,  connection fees, public pay telephone  services and  ancillary  services  (including  charges for additional services purchased at the customer's discretion).           During 1996 and 1997 the  Company  embarked  on a  significant  network development  program which met its  substantial  demand  backlog,  increased the number of basic  telephone  access  lines in  service  and  modernized  existing facilities.  The  development  and  installation  of the  network in each of the Company's Operating Areas required significant capital expenditures.                                        -32-            Now  that the  Company's  networks  are  substantially  built-out,  the ability  of  the  Company  to  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  satisfy  cash requirements  and  become  profitable  will  depend  upon a number  of  factors, including the Company's  ability to attract  additional  customers and increased revenues per customer.  These factors are expected to be primarily influenced by the success of the  Company's  operating  and  marketing  strategies  as well as market  acceptance of  telecommunications  services in the  Company's  Operating Areas. In addition,  the Company's  profitability  may be affected by changes in the  Company's  regulatory  environment  and other  factors  that are beyond the Company's  control.  The success of the Company's strategy is dependent upon its ability to increase  revenues  through  increased  usage and the addition of new subscribers.           The Company  funded its  construction  costs and working  capital needs over several years  primarily  through  Credit  Facilities  with Postabank and a $47.5 million  contractor  financing  facility.  On March 30, 1999,  and May 12, 1999, the Company entered into a series of transactions (see Notes 4, 5 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements)  which  restructured the Company's debt and capital  structure.  As the final step in the Company's debt and equity restructuring,  on April 11,  2000,  the Company  entered into a EUR 130 million Senior Secured Debt Facility with a European banking syndicate. See "- Liquidity and Capital Resources."           To date, the Company's  activities have involved the acquisition of the concessions  and  telecommunications  networks  from  Matav  and the  subsequent design,   development  and   construction   of  the  modern   telecommunications infrastructure  that  the  Company  now has in  service.  The  Company  paid the Ministry $11.5 million (at historical exchange rates) for its concessions, spent approximately  $23.2  million  (at  historical  exchange  rates) to acquire  the existing  telecommunications assets in its Operating Areas from Matav, and spent $190 million  through  December 31, 2000 (at historical  exchange  rates) on the development and  construction of its  telecommunications  infrastructure.  Since commencing the provision of telecommunications  services in the first quarter of 1995, the Company's network construction and expansion program has added 145,500 access  lines  through  December 31, 2000 to the 61,400  access  lines  acquired directly  from Matav.  As a result,  the Company  had  206,900  access  lines in operation at year end 2000.  Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2000 to Year Ended December 31, 1999           The  Company's  Hungarian  subsidiaries'  functional  currency  is  the Hungarian forint. The average Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rate for the year ended  December  31, 2000 was 281.10,  as compared to an average  Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 1999 of 238.08. This  devaluation of the Hungarian  forint against the U.S.  dollar reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Hungarian forint during the period. When  comparing the year ended  December 31, 2000 to the year ended December 31, 1999,  it  should  be noted  that all U.S.  dollar  reported  amounts  have been affected  by this 18%  devaluation  in the  Hungarian  subsidiaries'  functional currency.     Net Revenues                                                                 Year ended       (dollars in millions)                              2000            1999        Measured service revenues                         $ 30.7          $ 35.2       Subscription revenues                               13.1            10.9       Net interconnect charges                            (6.5)           (7.0)                                                          -----           -----       Net measured service and subscription revenues      37.3            39.1       Connection fees                                      2.1             1.8       Other operating revenues, net                        3.6             4.5                                                          -----           -----       Telephone Service Revenues, Net                    $43.0           $45.4                                                          =====           =====                                       -33-             The Company recorded a 5% decrease in net telephone service revenues to $43.0  million for the year ended  December 31, 2000 from $45.4  million for the year ended December 31, 1999.           Net  measured  service and  subscription  revenues  decreased  to $37.3 million for the year ended  December  31,  2000 from $39.1  million for the year ended  December 31,  1999.  Measured  service  revenues  decreased  13% to $30.7 million  in 2000  from  $35.2  million  in  1999,  while  subscription  revenues increased  20% to $13.1  million  in 2000 from $10.9  million in 1999.  Measured service revenues increased in functional currency terms by approximately 2% as a result of an  increase in average  access  lines in service  from  approximately 190,000  lines for the year ended  December  31, 1999 to  approximately  202,400 lines for the year ended  December 31, 2000,  offset by an average 3.6% decrease in call tariffs between 1999 and 2000 as a result of tariff  re-balancing  which was  introduced  during 2000.  Under  tariff  re-balancing,  a more  cost-driven payment  structure is envisaged  with monthly  subscription  fees  increasing to cover  network  infrastructure  expenses  over time.  In Hungary,  over the past several years, as in many other countries,  cheaper local call charges have been subsidized by expensive  international  and domestic  long-distance  calls.  The overall effect on a gross revenue basis for the telecom industry, as a whole, is expected to be neutral.  The increase in measured service revenues in functional currency terms,  however,  has been offset by the approximate 18% devaluation of the  functional  currency  during  the year  and,  therefore,  measured  service revenues show a 13% decrease  year-on-year  in U.S.  dollar terms.  Subscription revenues increased in functional currency terms by approximately 41% as a result of tariff  re-balancing  effective  February 1, 2000, as well as the increase in average  access  lines in  service.  The  increase in  subscription  revenues in functional  currency  terms,  however,  has been offset by the  approximate  18% devaluation   of  the  functional   currency   during  the  year  and  therefore subscription   revenues   show  only  a  20%  increase  in  U.S.   Dollar  terms year-on-year.           These  revenues  have been reduced by net  interconnect  charges  which totaled  $6.5  million for the year ended  December 31, 2000 as compared to $7.0 million  for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  As a  percentage  of call and subscription revenues, net interconnect charges have declined from 15.2% for the year ended  December  31, 1999 to 14.8% for the year ended  December  31,  2000. Based upon recent  negotiations with Matav and the TTW Ministry (later the Prime Minister's  Office),  the  Company  expects  net  interconnect   charges,  as  a percentage of call and subscription  revenues, to decrease in 2001 compared with 2000 levels.           Connection  fees,  which represent fees paid by customers to connect to the Company's  networks,  increased 17% for the year ended  December 31, 2000 to $2.1  million from $1.8  million for the year ended  December  31, 1999.  In the fourth  quarter of 2000, the Company  implemented  the Securities and Exchange's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), with effect from January 1, 2000, which requires connection fees and corresponding  direct incremental costs to be deferred and amortized over future periods. As a result of the implementation of SAB 101, certain connection fees and costs recognized in prior periods have been deferred and are being amortized over the estimated average subscriber life of 7 years.  There was no cumulative effect on earnings from the adoption of SAB 101, nor  has  its  adoption  had a  material  impact  on the  Company's  results  of operations.  Following  the  adoption of SAB 101, the  amortization  of deferred connection fee revenue and associated  direct  incremental  costs is included in telephone service revenues and operating and maintenance expenses.                                        -34-            Other operating  revenues,  which include  revenues  generated from the provision of direct lines and other  miscellaneous  telephone  service revenues, totaled $3.6 million for the year ended  December 31, 2000,  as compared to $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 1999.       Operating and Maintenance Expenses           Operating and  maintenance  expenses  decreased 2% to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.  In functional  currency  terms,  operating  and  maintenance expenses  increased 6%,  excluding  the effect of the change in  accounting  for connection fees and corresponding  direct  incremental costs, for the year ended December  31,  2000,  as  compared to the year ended  December  31,  1999.  This increase in functional currency terms is due to inflationary  increases in costs at the Company's Hungarian subsidiaries, offset by savings related to reductions in the number of  ex-patriates  working  for the  Company.  On a per line basis, operating and maintenance  expenses  decreased to approximately  $84 per average access  line for the year ended  December  31,  2000 from $92 for the year ended December 31, 1999.  On a per line basis,  operating  and  maintenance  costs are expected to decline as additional access lines are added during 2001.       Depreciation and Amortization           Depreciation and amortization  charges decreased $2.4 million,  or 20%, to $9.4 million for the year ended  December 31, 2000 from $11.8 million for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  This  decrease in U.S.  Dollar terms is due to depreciation and amortization charges decreasing in functional currency terms by approximately  6% combined  with the 18%  devaluation  of the  Hungarian  forint during the period.  The 6% decrease in depreciation and amortization  charges in functional  currency terms is due to additional  depreciation  being recorded at two of the  Company's  subsidiaries  during  1999 ($0.7  million  at  historical exchange rates) on certain network equipment.  The equipment was replaced due to the  subsidiaries'   relinquishment  of  rights  to  use  certain   broadcasting frequencies, previously granted by TTW Ministry.       Income from Operations           Income from  operations  increased to $16.5  million for the year ended December  31, 2000 from $16.2  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1999. Contributing to such improvement  were lower operating and maintenance  expenses and lower depreciation and amortization charges.       Foreign Exchange Losses           Foreign exchange losses  increased $2.0 million,  net of a gain of $0.9 million related to the Company's forward hedging contracts,  to $4.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 2000 from $2.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 1999. Such foreign  exchange losses resulted  primarily from the devaluation of the Hungarian forint against the U.S. dollar and euro during the period. This increase  in  foreign  exchange  losses  during  the  period  is also due to the Company's  refinancing  of its  debt  obligations  in April  2000.  Prior to its refinancing,  approximately  20%  of  the  Company's  debt  was  denominated  in currencies  other  than  the  Hungarian  forint,   whereas   subsequent  to  its refinancing,  the Company's debt is approximately  69% denominated in currencies                                        -35-   other  than the  Hungarian  forint.  Therefore,  when  such  non-forint  debt is converted into Hungarian forints, the Company reports foreign exchange losses on its consolidated financial statements when the Hungarian forint devalues against such non-forint  currencies  during the reporting  period.  See "- Inflation and Foreign  Currency," and Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About Market Risk - Market Risk Exposure."       Interest Expense           Interest  expense  decreased  43% to $18.5  million  for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.  This $14.0 million  decrease was partially  attributable to lower average debt levels during the year ended  December 31, 2000 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1999, due to the Company's restructuring of its debt obligations in May 1999 and the subsequent  refinancing of those  obligations in April 2000. As a result of the  refinancing  in April 2000,  the  Company's  borrowings  went from being mostly Hungarian  forint  denominated to mostly euro  denominated.  The decrease also reflects the lower  interest  rates paid on borrowings in U.S.  dollars and euros,  compared to Hungarian  forints.  As a result of the restructuring in May 1999 and the refinancing in April 2000, the Company's  weighted average interest rate on its debt  obligations  went from 13.17% for the year ended  December 31, 1999, to 10.70% for the year ended  December 31, 2000, a 19% decrease.  Included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 is  approximately  $1.6 million of amortization  of the forward points on the Company's  forward foreign currency contracts. See "- Liquidity and Capital Resources."       Interest Income           Interest  income  decreased to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 primarily due to lower interest rates on Hungarian forint deposits during the period.       Loss Before Extraordinary Items           As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company recorded a loss before  extraordinary  items of $5.3 million,  or $0.45 per share,  for the year ended  December  31, 2000 as compared  to a loss before  extraordinary  items of $17.8 million, or $1.85 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1999.        Extraordinary Items, net           For  the  year  ended  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  recorded  an extraordinary  item, net of $20.9 million  comprised of extraordinary  income of $27.2 million  which  consists of a $9.0 million gain on  extinguishment  of the liabilities  the  Company  had  with  Citizens  and  a  $18.2  million  gain  on extinguishment of all amounts due under a contractor financing facility,  offset in part by a non-cash  charge of $6.3  million  related to the  write-off of the remaining  unamortized  deferred  financing costs and credits  pertaining to the Original Postabank Credit Facility.        Net Income (Loss)           As a result of the factors  discussed above, the Company recorded a net loss available for common  stockholders of $5.4 million, or $0.45 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to net income  available for common stockholders of $3.1 million, or $0.33 per share for the year ended December 31, 1999.                                         -36-   Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 1999 to Year Ended December 31, 1998           The average  Hungarian  forint/U.S.  dollar  exchange rate for the year ended  December  31,  1999 was  238.08,  as  compared  to an  average  Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 1998 of 214.98. When  comparing the year ended  December 31, 1999 to the year ended December 31, 1998,  it  should  be noted  that all U.S.  dollar  reported  amounts  have been affected  by this 11%  devaluation  in the  Hungarian  subsidiaries'  functional currency.      Net Revenues                                                               Year ended       (dollars in millions)                              1999            1998       Measured service revenues                        $ 35.2          $ 32.2       Subscription revenues                              10.9            10.7       Net interconnect charges                           (7.0)           (9.8)                                                         -----           -----        Net measured service and subscription revenues     39.1            33.1       Connection fees                                     1.8             2.0       Other operating revenues, net                       4.5             3.6                                                         -----           -----       Telephone Service Revenues, Net                   $45.4           $38.7                                                         =====           =====            The Company  recorded a 17% increase in net telephone  service revenues to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.           Net measured service and subscription  revenues  increased 18% to $39.1 million for the year ended  December  31,  1999 from $33.1  million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Measured service revenues increased 9% to $35.2 million in 1999 from $32.2 million in 1998 while  subscription  revenues increased 2% to $10.9  million in 1999 from $10.7 million in 1998.  These  increases in call and subscription  fee  revenues  were the result of a 7% increase in average  access lines in service from  approximately  178,000 lines for the year ended  December 31, 1998 to approximately 190,000 lines for the year ended December 31, 1999.           These  revenues were offset by net  interconnect  charges which totaled $7.0  million for the year ended  December  31, 1999 as compared to $9.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998. As a percentage of call and  subscription revenues, net interconnect charges declined from 23% for the year ended December 31, 1998 to 15% for the year ended December 31, 1999, due to a higher proportion of local  traffic  as  additional  access  lines are  placed in  service  plus a negotiated reduction in interconnect fees effective January 1, 1999.           Connection  fees for the year ended  December  31,  1999  totaled  $1.8 million as  compared  to $2.0  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1998. Connection  fees increased in functional  currency terms by 5% due to additional access lines being  connected in 1999 as compared to 1998.  However,  due to the devaluation  of the  Hungarian  Forint  during  1999,  connection  fees for 1999 remained relatively consistent in U.S dollar terms with 1998 amounts.                                        -37-            Other operating  revenues increased 25% to $4.5 million during the year ended  December 31, 1999 compared to $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 1998 due to revenues  generated from the provision of direct lines and other miscellaneous telephony service revenues.       Operating and Maintenance Expenses           Operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 decreased to $17.5 million compared to $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. On a per line basis,  operating and maintenance  expenses decreased to approximately  $92 per average  access line for the year ended December 31, 1999 from  $110 for the year  ended  December  31,  1998 as a result  of the  Company achieving  productivity  improvements  and  increasing  its  focus  on  reducing operating   expenses,   particularly   through   reductions  in  the  number  of ex-patriates  working  for  the  Company,  as  well  as the  devaluation  of the Hungarian forint.       Depreciation and Amortization           Depreciation  and amortization  charges  increased to $11.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 1999 from $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Depreciation and amortization charges increased in functional currency terms by approximately 13% due to additional capital  expenditures  between 1998 and 1999 and extra  depreciation on certain network equipment.  However,  due to the  devaluation  of  the  Hungarian   forint  during  1999,   depreciation  and amortization  charges for the year ended 1999 remained relatively  consistent in U.S. dollar terms with 1998 amounts.       Management Fees           There was no  management  fee expense for the year ended  December  31, 1999 as compared to $2.5  million for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  This decrease was due to the termination of a management  services  agreement between the Company and Citizens International  Management Services Company. See Note 12 of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The Company does not have any continuing management services agreements.       Cost of Termination of Management Services Agreement           For the year ended  December  31, 1998,  the Company  recorded a charge totaling  $11.1  million  representing  the  present  value of  payments  due to Citizens  International  Management  Services  Company under a  termination  and consulting agreement. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       Income (Loss) from Operations           Income from  operations  was $16.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1999  compared to a loss from  operations of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.  Adjusted for the cost of terminating the management services agreement  and  management  fees,  income  from  operations  for the year  ended December 31, 1998 amounted to $7.6 million.  Contributing  to such  improvements were higher  revenues  and lower  operating  and  maintenance  expenses  and the elimination  of the  management  fees  described  above  during  the year  ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December  31,  1998,  offset by increased depreciation and amortization charges during 1999.                                        -38-        Foreign Exchange Losses           Foreign  exchange losses increased $2.6 million to $2.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 1999 from $0.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998. Such foreign  exchange  losses resulted  primarily from the devaluation of the  Hungarian  forint  against the U.S.  dollar  during 1999.  This increase in foreign exchange losses during 1999 is due to the Company's restructuring of its debt  obligations in May 1999. Prior to its  restructuring  the Company had debt denominated in Hungarian forints. Subsequent to the Company's restructuring,  it has debt obligations denominated in U.S. dollars and euros, as well as Hungarian forints.  Therefore,  when such  non-forint  debt is  converted  into  Hungarian forints,  the  Company  reports  foreign  exchange  losses  on its  consolidated financial  statements when the Hungarian forint devalues against such non-forint currencies during the reporting period.  See "- Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for information  regarding the Company's debt  restructuring.  See also "- Inflation  and  Foreign  Currency,"  and Item 7A  Quantitative  and  Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Market Risk Exposure" below.       Interest Expense           Interest expense decreased to $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.  This decrease was attributable to lower average debt levels during the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1998.  This reduction in average debt levels outstanding during 1999 is due to the Company's restructuring of its debt  obligations  in May 1999.  The decrease also reflects lower interest rates paid on borrowings in U.S. Dollars and Euros compared to Hungarian Forints.       Interest Income           Interest  income  increased to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily due to higher average cash balances outstanding during 1999.       Other, net           Other expense  amounted to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to other income of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This decrease is due to an approximate  $0.8 million gain realized related to the  termination  of the former  management  services  agreement  between the Company and Citizens International  Management Services Company during 1998. The Company does not have any continuing management services agreements. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       Loss Before Extraordinary Items           As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company recorded a loss before  extraordinary  items of $17.8 million,  or $1.85 per share, for the year ended  December  31, 1999 as compared  to a loss before  extraordinary  items of $50.6 million, or $9.53 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1998.                                        -39-         Extraordinary Items, net           For  the  year  ended  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  recorded  an extraordinary  item of $20.9 million comprised of extraordinary  income of $27.2 million  which  consists  of a  $9.0  million  gain  on  extinguishment  of  the liabilities  the  Company  had  with  Citizens  and  a  $18.2  million  gain  on extinguishment of all amounts due under a contractor financing facility,  offset in part by a  non-cash  charge of $6.3  million  related  to the  write-off  the remaining  unamortized  deferred  financing costs and credits  pertaining to the Original Postabank Credit Facility.        Net Income (Loss)           As a result of the factors  discussed  above,  the Company recorded net income of $3.2 million,  or $0.33 per share for the year ended December 31, 1999 as  compared to a net loss of $50.6  million,  or ($9.53) per share for the year ended December 31, 1998.  Liquidity and Capital Resources           The Company has historically funded its capital requirements  primarily through  a  combination  of debt,  equity  and  vendor  financing.  The  ongoing development and  installation of the network in each of the Company's  operating areas  required  significant  capital  expenditures  ($190 million at historical exchange  rates through  December 31, 2000).  By the end of 1998,  the Company's networks had the capacity, with only normal capital expenditure  requirements in the  future,  to  provide  basic  telephone  services  to  virtually  all of the potential subscribers within its Operating Areas.           On October 15, 1996,  the Company  entered into a $170 million  10-year Multi-Currency  Credit Facility with Postabank (the "Original  Postabank  Credit Facility").  Proceeds from the Original Postabank Credit Facility could be drawn entirely in Hungarian  forints and up to 20% of the principal  could be drawn in U.S.  dollars  through  March 31,  1999.  Drawdowns  in  Hungarian  forints bore interest  at a rate  of  2.5%  above  the  average  of the  yield  on  six-  and twelve-month discounted Hungarian treasury bills while drawdowns in U.S. Dollars bore interest at 2.5% above LIBOR. Interest for the first two years was deferred at the Company's option. Amounts outstanding in Hungarian Forints, including any deferred interest,  were payable in 32 equal quarterly installments beginning on March 31, 1999.           In October 1996,  the Company  borrowed the equivalent of $82.3 million in Hungarian forints under the Original Postabank Credit Facility. Approximately $75.2  million of this  amount  was used to repay  Citicorp  all funds  advanced pursuant to a $75.0 million  secured term loan credit  facility  entered into in March 1996, and $2.0 million was paid for certain other fees. The remaining $5.1 million was used to pay management fees and reimbursable  costs owed to Citizens pursuant to a Management  Services  Agreement with Citizens.  An additional $5.6 million  of the  Original  Postabank  Credit  Facility  was  used  to  pay  loan origination  fees and costs to Postabank  under the terms of the loan agreement, $2  million  of  which  were  reimbursed  to  the  Company  in  equal  quarterly installments  over a two year period,  with the net amount being  amortized over the life of the loan  facility.  The  remainder  of the  proceeds  were  used to complete  construction  of the  Company's  telecommunication  networks,  provide additional  working  capital,   and  refinance  or  repay  other  existing  debt obligations.  As of December 31, 1998,  the Company had borrowed the entire $170 million under the Original Postabank Credit Facility.                                        -40-            On May 12, 1999, the Company entered into various agreements as part of a revision of its capital structure with the following parties:  Postabank; Tele Danmark;  the  Danish  Fund;  and  CU  CapitalCorp  and  Citizens  International Management  Services Company,  two wholly-owned  subsidiaries of Citizens.  As a result of such agreements,  the Company  extinguished all of its obligations (i) to  Postabank  under the  Original  Postabank  Credit  Facility in the amount of approximately  $193  million,  and the amounts  borrowed to settle a portion due under a  contractor  financing  facility  in the  amount  of  approximately  $16 million; (ii) to one of its contractors under a contractor financing facility in the amount of  approximately  $35 million;  and (iii) to Citizens  under an $8.4 million  promissory  note  which was  payable in 2004 and an  obligation  to pay Citizens $21 million in 28  quarterly  installments  of $750,000  each from 2004 through  and  including  2010.  The  effect  of  these  transactions   caused  a significant  reduction in the financial  obligations of the Company. The Company simultaneously  borrowed from  Postabank  $138 million (at  historical  exchange rates) under a one-year  dual currency  bridge loan  agreement  (the  "Postabank Bridge  Loan ") in  Hungarian  forints  and euros and $25  million  pursuant  to certain  unsecured  notes which mature in 2007.  Some of the various  agreements which were entered into as of May 12, 1999 are further described below.           Pursuant to the Postabank Bridge Loan, HTCC's subsidiaries borrowed the equivalent of $111 million (at historical  exchange rates) in Hungarian  forints and $27  million  in euros (at  historical  exchange  rates),  which  funds were applied to the repayment of the Original Postabank Credit Facility. The loan was repayable  no later than May 10, 2000 and bore  interest  at an initial  rate of 2.25% (the  "Margin")  plus the Budapest  Bank Offering Rate or Euro LIBOR Rate, which Margin  increased  incrementally  to 4.25%, in quarterly  increments of 1% over the loan term.           The Company and  Postabank  also  entered  into a  Securities  Purchase Agreement (the  "Postabank  Securities  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant to which Postabank  purchased  2,428,572  shares  of the  Company's  common  stock for an aggregate  purchase  price of $34 million.  The  Postabank  Securities  Purchase Agreement  provides for one person  designated  by Postabank to be nominated for election to the Company's  Board of Directors.  Postabank can only transfer such shares  incrementally  through  2003  subject  to the  Company's  right of first refusal.  The Company's  right of first  refusal  expires in January 2003 and is assignable  by the  Company  to any  beneficial  holder  of more than 10% of the Company's  outstanding  common stock.  The Company applied the proceeds from the stock  issuance to the  repayment of the  Original  Postabank  Credit  Facility. Pursuant to the Postabank  Securities  Purchase  Agreement,  the Company  issued notes to  Postabank in an aggregate  amount of $25 million  (the  "Notes")  with detachable  warrants  (the  "Warrants").  The Notes  accrue  interest,  which is payable  semi-annually,  at the LIBOR rate applicable for the six month interest period,  plus  3.5%.  The Notes  which  mature in 2007,  are  transferable.  The Warrants enable  Postabank to purchase  2,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $10 per share.  The exercise  period  commences on January 1, 2004 and  terminates on March 31, 2007.  The Company has the right to terminate  the  Warrants  in full or  proportionately  prior to  January 1, 2004 provided that the Company (i) repays a  proportionate  amount of the outstanding principal on the Notes to the holders of such Notes and (ii) pays an  additional 7.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repaid concurrently with the termination of the Warrants to the holders of the Warrants.           The Company and Tele Danmark  entered into a Stock  Purchase  Agreement (the "TD  Stock  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant  to which  the  Company  issued 1,571,429 shares of the Company's common stock in exchange for $11 million.  The Company  applied  the  proceeds  from the TD  Stock  Purchase  Agreement  to the repayment of the Original Postabank Credit Facility.                                        -41-            The Company  and the Danish  Fund for  Central and Eastern  Europe (the "Danish Fund")  entered into a Stock Purchase  Agreement (the "Danish Fund Stock Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant to which the Company issued  1,285,714 shares of the Company's  common stock in exchange for $9 million.  The Company applied the proceeds from the Danish Fund Stock  Purchase  Agreement to the repayment of the Original Postabank Credit Facility.           The Company and Citizens  entered into a Stock Purchase  Agreement (the "Citizens  Stock  Purchase  Agreement')  pursuant to which the Company issued to Citizens 1,300,000 shares of the Company's common stock and 30,000 shares of the Company's Series A Cumulative  Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 (the "Preferred Stock").  In consideration for such shares,  Citizens (i) transferred to the Company for  cancellation  an $8.4 million  promissory note issued by the Company to Citizens  which was to mature in 2004,  (ii) agreed to forego half of the accrued  interest due on the promissory  note through May 15, 1999 and (iii) agreed to renounce  and forego any rights  whatsoever  to any payment of the $21 million  which was payable by the Company to Citizens in quarterly  installments of $750,000 from 2004 through and including 2010. Citizens, as the holder of the Preferred  Stock, is entitled to receive  cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 5%,  compounded  annually on the liquidation value of $70 per share. The Company may redeem the Preferred  Shares at any time.  Citizens can convert each of the Preferred  Shares into shares of the Company's  common stock on a one for ten basis.  The Citizens Stock Purchase  Agreement  provided that if the average closing  price of HTCC's  common  stock for the twenty (20)  trading days ending March 31,  2000 was less than  $7.00 per share,  then the  Company  would  issue additional  shares of Preferred Stock to Citizens.  The average closing price of the Company's  common stock for the above  mentioned  period was more than $7.00 per share and, as a result,  no additional  shares of Preferred Stock was issued to  Citizens.  Citizens  also waived any and all  preemptive  and  anti-dilution rights in connection with the  transactions  described above. As a result of the Stock  Purchase  Agreement  with Citizens,  the Company  recorded  extraordinary income of $9.0 million  during the second  quarter of 1999 which  represented  a gain on the extinguishment of the liabilities the Company had with Citizens.           During 1996 and 1997,  the Company  entered into  several  construction contracts with a contractor which totaled $59.0 million in the aggregate,  $47.5 million of which was financed by a contractor financing facility. The contractor financed  the  construction  through a facility  provided  by  Postabank.  As of December 31, 1998, the balance owed under the contractor  financing facility was $36.6 million.  On March 30, 1999,  Postabank assumed HUF 7 billion plus accrued interest of HUF 348 million  (approximately $30.9 million at historical exchange rates) of the Company's  liability under the contractor  financing facility from the contractor,  due to the contractor's financial  difficulties,  and sold this debt back to the  Company  for HUF 3 billion  (approximately  $12.6  million  at historical  exchange rates). The purchase of the debt was financed by Postabank. On the same  day,  the  Company  purchased  HUF 4 billion  (approximately  $16.8 million at historical exchange rates) of loans the contractor had with Postabank for HUF 900 million  (approximately  $3.8 million at historical  exchange rates) and  subsequently  offset the  booked  value of the loans  purchased  of HUF 900 million  (approximately  $3.8 million at historical  exchange rates) against the outstanding amounts owed to the contractor. The purchase of these loans was also financed  by  Postabank.  As a result of the  above  transactions,  the  Company recorded an extraordinary gain of HUF 4.3 billion  (approximately  $18.2 million at historical exchange rates) during the second quarter of 1999, which reflected the extinguishment of all amounts due under the contractor financing facility.                                        -42-            On April 11, 2000,  the Company  entered into an EUR 130 million Senior Secured Debt Facility  Agreement (the "Debt  Agreement") with a European banking syndicate.  The Company  drew down EUR 129 million of the  Facility on April 20, 2000 ($121  million at April 20, 2000  exchange  rates),  which funds were used, along  with $7.3  million of other  Company  funds (at April 20,  2000  exchange rates) to pay off the entire  outstanding  EUR 134 million  (approximately  $126 million at April 20, 2000  exchange  rates)  principal  and  interest due on the Postabank  Bridge Loan which was due to mature on May 12, 2000,  and to pay fees associated with the Debt  Agreement.  The borrowers under the Debt Agreement are the Operating  Companies who were the borrowers under the Postabank Bridge Loan. The Debt  Agreement  and some of the related  agreements  are further  described below.           The Debt  Agreement has two  facilities.  Facility A is a floating rate term loan in the amount of EUR 125 million (the "Term Facility") which principal is  repayable  in  installments  semi-annually  on each June 30 and  December 31 beginning on June 30, 2001 and ending on December  31, 2007.  The amounts of the principal  repayments on the Term Facility are to be escalating  percentages  of the amounts  drawn down.  The Company has borrowed the full EUR 125 million,  of which  EUR 84.1  million  was  funded  in,  an is  repayable  in,  euros and the equivalent  of EUR 40.9  million was funded in, and is repayable  in,  Hungarian forints.  The portion of the Term  Facility  loan  denominated  in euros accrues interest at the rate of the Applicable  Margin  (defined below) plus the EURIBOR rate for the applicable interest period. The EURIBOR rate is the percentage rate per annum  determined by the Banking  Federation  of the European  Union for the applicable interest period. The portion of the Term Facility loan denominated in Hungarian forints accrues interest at the rate of the Applicable Margin (defined below) plus the BUBOR rate for the applicable interest period. The BUBOR rate is the percentage rate per annum determined  according to the rules  established by the Hungarian  Forex  Association  and published by the National Bank of Hungary for the  applicable  interest  period.  The applicable  interest  period for the portion  of the Term  Facility  loan  denominated  in euros is six  months.  The applicable  interest period for the portion of Term Facility loan denominated in Hungarian  forints  is three  months.  Interest  is  payable  at the end of each interest period. The Applicable Margin is initially 1.75%. The Applicable Margin may be  adjusted  downward  incrementally  to a minimum of 1.15%  subject to the financial  performance  of the Company as measured by the ratio of the Company's senior  debt  to  its  earnings  before   interest,   taxes,   depreciation  and amortization. Dependent on its cash flow, the Company will be required to prepay the  equivalent  of $25  million  on the Term  Facility  until  such time as $25 million has been prepaid.  The amount of the  prepayment in any year shall be at least 50% of the Company's excess cash flow, if any, for the previous  financial year as defined in the Debt  Agreement.  The prepayment  amount is due within 15 days of the  publication  of each  annual Form 10-K  filing.  For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company does not have any excess cash flow, as defined in the Debt Agreement, and therefore no mandatory prepayment is going to be made by the Company in 2001.           Facility B is a  floating  rate  revolving  loan in the amount of EUR 5 million (the "Revolving  Facility")  which can only be drawn down in euros.  The Revolving  Facility will be reduced to EUR 2.5 million on December 31, 2005. The Revolving  Facility is available  until December 31, 2007. The Company  borrowed EUR 4 million of the Revolving  Facility to pay off the balance of the Postabank Bridge Loan and fees  associated  with the  transaction  on April 20, 2000.  The principal amount borrowed under the Revolving Facility is due at the end of each interest period at which point the Company can,  subject to certain  conditions,                                        -43-   roll over the amount of principal  borrowed.  The applicable interest period for the Revolving  Facility is, at the Company's option,  one, three, or six months. The Company has chosen six months at the  present  time.  Interest is payable at the end of each interest period calculated similarly to that for a Term Facility loan denominated in euros.           The  Company  paid an  arrangement  fee in the amount of EUR  2,665,000 (approximately  $2.5 million at April 20, 2000 exchange  rates),  which has been capitalized with other direct costs incurred in obtaining the Debt Agreement and is being amortized over the term of the related debt. In addition, an agency fee in the amount of $60,000 has also been paid.  The Company is  obligated to pay a commitment  fee equal to the lower of 0.75% or 50% of the  Applicable  Margin on any available unused commitment on the Revolving Facility.           HTCC and one of its  subsidiaries,  HTCC Consulting Rt., are guarantors for the Operating  Companies under the Debt Agreement.  The Company and Citibank Rt. (as security  agent) have entered into a series of  agreements to secure all of the  Company's  obligations  under the Debt  Agreement  pursuant to which the Company has pledged all of its intangible and tangible assets,  including HTCC's ownership interests in its subsidiaries,  and its real property.  The Company is subject to restrictive  covenants,  including restrictions regarding the ability of the Company to pay dividends,  borrow funds, merge and dispose of its assets. The  Debt  Agreement  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties  and customary  events of default,  including  those  related to a change of control, which would trigger early repayment of the balance under the Debt Agreement.  If prior to the later of the  December  31,  2001 or the  Trigger  Date (as defined below),  Tele Danmark  sells any of the shares of Common Stock that it currently owns or Tele Danmark and the Danish Fund,  together,  no longer own 30.1% of the outstanding  Common Stock,  then an event of default shall have  occurred.  Tele Danmark  and the Danish  Fund  currently  own a  combined  total of 31.9% of the outstanding  common stock.  The Trigger Date is defined as the date on which for the prior two fiscal  quarters the  Company's  debt to EBITDA ratio is less than 3.5 to 1. Following the Trigger Date,  Tele Danmark can only transfer its shares with the prior written  consent of banks holding at least 66.7% of the Company's outstanding debt under the Debt Agreement.           The Company had  12,087,179  shares of common stock  outstanding  as of December 31, 2000,  which were held by the following  parties in the percentages indicated:  Postabank 20.1%; Tele Danmark 21.2%; the Danish Fund 10.6%; Citizens 19.1%;  and others 29.0%. On a fully-diluted  basis,  the Company has 15,821,816 shares outstanding,  which were held by the following parties in the percentages indicated:  Postabank 31.2%; Tele Danmark 16.2%; the Danish Fund 8.1%;  Citizens 16.5%; and others 28.0%.           Net cash provided by operating  activities totaled $8.3 million for the year ended  December  31,  2000  compared  to $18.5  million  for the year ended December 31,  1999.  For the period ended  December 31, 1999,  cash  provided by operations  reflects the deferral of $13.3 million of interest,  which was added to amounts due under the Postabank Bridge Loan. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company used $8.8 million and $9.9 million,  respectively, in investing  activities,  which  was  primarily  used  to  fund  additions  to the Company's telecommunications networks. Financing activities provided net cash of $0.5  million and $1.0  million for the years ended  December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.                                        -44-   Inflation and Foreign Currency           For the  year  ended  December  31,  2000,  inflation  in  Hungary  was approximately  9.8% on an annualized  basis. It is the stated policy goal of the Hungarian government to keep inflation from exceeding  approximately 6% in 2001. Due to the  strengthening of the U.S. dollar on  international  currency markets during the year,  the Hungarian  forint/U.S.  dollar  exchange rate increased to 284.73 as of December 31, 2000,  as compared to an exchange rate of 252.52 as of December 31, 1999, an effective year-on-year devaluation of 12.8%.           The  Company's  Hungarian  operations  generate  revenues in  Hungarian forints and incur operating and other expenses,  including capital expenditures, predominately  in  Hungarian  forints  but also in U.S.  dollars  and euros.  In addition,  certain of the  Company's  balance  sheet  accounts are  expressed in foreign  currencies  other than the Hungarian  forint,  the Company's  Hungarian subsidiaries' functional currency. Accordingly, when such accounts are converted into  Hungarian  forints,  the Company is subject to foreign  exchange gains and losses  which are  reflected  as a  component  of net  income or loss.  When the Company and its  subsidiaries'  forint-denominated  accounts are translated into U.S.  dollars  for  financial  reporting  purposes,  the  Company  is subject to translation  adjustments,  the effect of which is  reflected  as a component  of stockholders' deficiency.           While the Company has the ability to increase the prices it charges for its services  commensurate with increases in the Hungarian  Consumer Price Index ("CPI")  pursuant to its licenses from the Hungarian  government,  it may choose not to implement the full amount of the increase  permitted  due to  competitive and other concerns.  In addition,  the rate of increase in the Hungarian CPI may be less than the rate at which the Hungarian forint devalues.  As a result,  the Company may be unable to generate cash flows to the degree necessary to meet its obligation in currencies other than the Hungarian forint.  Prospective Accounting Pronouncements           Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 133 ("SFAS  133"), "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities",  was issued by the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board in June 1998 and subsequently amended by Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 138 ("SFAS 138") issued in June 1999.  SFAS 133 and SFAS 138  standardize  the  accounting  for  derivative instruments,   including  certain  derivative   instruments  embedded  in  other contracts.  Under the  Standards,  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value.           The  Company  adopted  SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 on January  1,  2001.  The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 will have a material effect on the Company's  consolidated  financial position and results of operations.         Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Market Risk Exposure           The Company is exposed to various types of risk in the normal course of its  business,   including  the  impact  of  foreign   currency   exchange  rate fluctuations  and interest  rate  changes.  Company  operations,  including  all revenues and  approximately  84% of operational costs are Hungarian forint based and are  therefore  subject to exchange rate  variability  between the Hungarian forint and the U.S.  dollar.  This  variability is mitigated by several factors, including the Hungarian National Bank policy to peg the Hungarian forint and the                                        -45-   telecommunications  pricing law. The "crawling  peg" policy of the National Bank of Hungary maintains a scheduled daily devaluation of the Hungarian forint which has been pegged 100% to the euro since January 1, 2000. The Hungarian  forint is allowed to trade within 2.25% of the  mid-point  of this trading  band.  For the first quarter of 2001, the Hungarian government's devaluation policy is 0.3% per month.  The  Hungarian   government  has  announced  that  the  monthly  planned devaluation rate will be decreased as of April 1, 2001 to 0.2% per month for the Hungarian  forint,   which  would  total   approximately   2.7%  for  2001.  The telecommunications  pricing law allows prices to increase by the Consumer  Price Index (CPI),  adjusted for an efficiency  factor of 2% in 2000 and 2.9% in 2001. Thus, to the extent that adjusted CPI follows devaluation, and to the extent the Company elects and is able to increase its revenues  proportionate  to increases in the CPI, revenues are somewhat insulated from exchange rate risk.           The debt obligations of the Company are Hungarian forint, euro and U.S. dollar  denominated.  The interest rate on the Hungarian forint debt obligations is based on the Budapest Bank Offer Rate (BUBOR). The interest rates on the euro and U.S.  dollar  denominated  obligations  are based on EURIBOR  and USD LIBOR, respectively. Over the medium to long term, the BUBOR rate is expected to follow inflation and devaluation  trends and the Company does not currently  believe it has any material  interest rate risk on any of its Hungarian forint  denominated debt  obligations.  If a 1% change in the BUBOR interest rate were to occur, the Company's interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately  $369,000 annually based upon the Company's  current debt level. If a 1% change in EURIBOR interest rates were to occur,  the Company's  interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $0.8 million annually based upon the Company's current debt  level.  If a 1% change  in USD LIBOR  interest  rates  were to occur,  the Company's  interest  expense would  increase or decrease by  approximately  $0.3 million annually based upon the Company's current debt level.           The  Company  is also  exposed  to  exchange  rate risk  insofar as the Company  has debt  obligations  in other  than the  functional  currency  of its majority owned  Hungarian  subsidiaries.  Given the Company's debt  obligations, which include euro and U.S. dollar denominated debt, if a 1% change in Hungarian forint/euro exchange rates were to occur, the Company's exchange rate risk would increase or decrease by approximately $820,000 annually based upon the Company's current debt level.  If a 1% change in  Hungarian  forint/U.S.  dollar  exchange rates were to occur, the Company's exchange rate risk would increase or decrease by approximately $250,000 annually.           The Company  utilizes  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to reduce certain exposure to exchange rate risks associated with cash requirements  under the Company's  long-term  debt  obligations  that mature within six months.  The forward  contracts  establish the exchange  rates at which the Company will sell the  contracted  amount of  Hungarian  forints for euros at a future  date.  The Company  utilizes  forward  contracts  which are six months in  duration  and at maturity  will  either  receive or pay the  difference  between  the  contracted forward rate and the exchange rate at the settlement date. The contracted amount of  foreign   currency   forwards  at  December   31,  2000  is  EUR   2,998,000 (approximately $2,790,000). The counterparties to the Company's foreign currency forward  contracts are substantial  and  creditworthy  multinational  commercial banks or other  financial  institutions  which  are  recognized  market  makers. Neither the risks of counterparty  nonperformance nor the economic  consequences of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are considered by the Company to be material.                                        -46-                  Item 8.
