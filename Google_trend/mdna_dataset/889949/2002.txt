ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  INTRODUCTION       The Company is engaged primarily in the provision of telecommunications services through its operating subsidiaries, KNC, Raba-Com, Papatel and Hungarotel (which have all been merged into Hungarotel effective January 1, 2002). The Company earns substantially all of its telecommunications revenue from measured service fees, monthly line rental fees, connection fees, public pay telephone services and ancillary services (including charges for additional services purchased at the customer's discretion).       During 1996 and 1997, the Company embarked on a significant network development program which met its substantial demand backlog, increased the number of basic telephone access lines in service and modernized existing facilities. The development and installation of the network in each of the Company's Operating Areas required significant capital expenditures.       Now that the Company's networks are built-out, the ability of the Company to generate sufficient revenues to satisfy cash requirements and maintain profitability will depend upon a number of factors, including the Company's ability to attract additional customers both in and outside its Operating Areas and increased revenues per customer. These factors are expected to be primarily influenced by the success of the Company's operating and marketing strategies, as well as market acceptance of telecommunications services both in and outside the Company's operating areas. In addition, the Company's profitability may be affected by changes in the Company's regulatory environment and other factors that are beyond the Company's control.       The Company funded its construction costs and working capital needs over several years primarily through credit facilities with Postabank and a $47.5 million contractor financing facility. On March 30, 1999, and May 12, 1999, the Company entered into a series of transactions (see Notes 5 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) which restructured the Company's debt and capital structure. As the final step in the Company's debt and equity restructuring, on April 11, 2000, the Company entered into a EUR 130 million Senior Secured Debt Facility with a European banking syndicate. See "- Liquidity and Capital Resources."       To date, the Company's activities have involved the acquisition of the concessions and telecommunications networks from Matav and the subsequent design, development and construction of the modern telecommunications infrastructure that the Company now has in service. The Company paid the Ministry $11.5 million (at historical exchange rates) for its concessions, spent approximately $23.2 million (at historical exchange rates) to acquire the existing telecommunications assets in its Operating Areas from Matav, and spent $197 million through December 31, 2001 (at historical exchange rates) on the development and construction of its telecommunications infrastructure. Since commencing the provision of telecommunications services in the first quarter of 1995, the Company's network construction and expansion program has added 142,100 access lines through December 31, 2001 to the 61,400 access lines acquired directly from Matav. As a result, the Company had 203,500 access lines in operation at year-end 2001. During the past year, due to the Company's revised collection procedures, as well as economic developments within the areas the Company operates in and competition from the mobile market, the Company's number of disconnections has increased such that the total number of access lines in service is lower than at the beginning of 2001 by 2%. The Company is attempting to deal                                        -30-    with this decrease in access lines by developing new subscription packages, as well as through expanding into other markets within Hungary.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US GAAP"). This preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. US GAAP provides the framework from which to make these estimates, assumption and disclosures. The Company chooses accounting policies within US GAAP that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report the Company's operating results and financial position in a consistent manner. Management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions. The Company's accounting policies are stated in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the results of operations and the effect of the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:       Revenue Recognition Policies -- The Company recognizes revenues, net of interconnect charges, when services are rendered to the customer. The Company's pricing is subject to oversight by the Hungarian regulators. Such regulation also covers interconnection, competition and other public policy issues. Regulatory interpretation of the Communications Act and related Decrees, Hungary's planned accession into the EU and changes in the political environment within Hungary all could result in changes in the level of the Company's revenues. The Company monitors the decisions of the regulator and the Hungarian market closely, and will make adjustments to revenue and associated expenses if necessary. The Company records deferred costs and revenues related to the costs and related installation revenue associated with connecting new customers to the Company's networks. Based on the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 ("SAB 101"), the Company amortizes these amounts over an estimated seven year average period. If a significant number of customers were to leave the service of the Company, the amortization of those deferred costs and revenues would accelerate.       Allowance for Doubtful Accounts -- The Company reviews the valuation of accounts receivable on a monthly basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts.       Long-lived Asset Recovery -- Long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment and intangibles, comprise a significant portion of the Company's total assets. Changes in technology or changes in the Company's intended use of these assets may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Estimates and assumptions used in both setting depreciable lives and reviewing recoverability require both judgement and estimation by management. Impairment is deemed to have occurred if projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset are less than its carrying value. If impairment is deemed to have occurred, the carrying values of the assets are written down, through a charge against earnings, to their fair value.                                        -31-         Contingent Liabilities -- The Company establishes accruals for estimated loss contingencies when it is management's assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the previous assessments as to the likelihood of and estimated amount of loss. Accruals for contingent liabilities are based upon management's assumptions and estimates, after giving consideration to the advice of legal counsel and other information relevant to the assessment of the probable outcome of the matter. Should the outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates, revisions to the estimated accruals for contingent liabilities would be required.       Income Taxes -- In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning in making these assessments. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in the income tax laws or the results from reviews of the Company's tax returns by taxing authorities.  COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000       The Company's Hungarian subsidiaries' functional currency is the Hungarian forint. The average Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 286.49, as compared to an average Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2000 of 281.10. When comparing the year ended December 31, 2001 to the year ended December 31, 2000, it should be noted that all U.S. dollar reported amounts have been affected by this 2% devaluation in the Hungarian subsidiaries' functional currency.  Net Revenues                                                         Year ended    (dollars in millions)                             2001        2000    Measured service revenues                       $ 29.2      $  30.7    Subscription revenues                             16.1         13.1    Net interconnect charges                         (6.5)        (6.5)                                                     ------       -----    Net measured service and subscription revenues    38.8         37.3    Connection fees                                    2.2          2.1    Other operating revenues, net                      4.2          3.6                                                      ----         ----    Telephone Service Revenues, Net                 $ 45.2      $  43.0                                                    ======      =======       The Company recorded a 5% increase in net telephone service revenues to $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.        Net measured service and subscription revenues increased to $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Measured service revenues decreased 5% to $29.2 million in 2001 from $30.7 million in 2000, while subscription revenues increased 23% to $16.1 million in 2001 from $13.1 million in 2000. Measured service revenues decreased in functional currency terms by approximately 3% as a result of an average 3.6% decrease in call tariffs                                        -32-    between 2000 and 2001 as a result of continued tariff re-balancing which was introduced during 2000, offset by an increase in average access lines in service from approximately 202,400 for the year ended December 31, 2000 to approximately 204,900 for the year ended December 31, 2001. Subscription revenues increased in functional currency terms by approximately 25% as a result of continued tariff re-balancing. Under tariff re-balancing, a more cost-driven payment structure is envisaged, with the actual monthly subscription fees increasing to cover network infrastructure expenses over time. In Hungary, as in many other countries over the past several years, cheaper local call charges have been subsidized by expensive international and domestic long-distance calls. The overall effect on a gross revenue basis for the Company and the telecom industry as a whole is expected to be neutral. The increase in subscription revenues in functional currency terms has been offset to an extent by the approximate 2% devaluation of the functional currency between the periods and, therefore, subscription revenues show only a 23% increase in U.S. dollar terms.       These revenues have been reduced by net interconnect charges, which totaled $6.5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. As a percentage of call and subscription revenues, net interconnect charges have declined from 14.8% for the year ended December 31, 2000 to 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Due to the regulatory regime not liberalizing the market in Hungary as quickly as expected, the Company does not expect net interconnect charges as a percentage of call and subscription revenues to decrease considerably in 2002 as compared with 2001 levels.       Connection fees, which represent fees paid by customers to connect to the Company's networks, increased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $2.2 million from $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company implemented the Securities and Exchange's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), with effect from January 1, 2000, which requires connection fees and corresponding direct incremental costs to be deferred and amortized over future periods. As a result of the implementation of SAB 101, certain connection fees and costs recognized in prior periods have been deferred and are being amortized over the estimated average subscriber life of 7 years. There was no cumulative effect on earnings from the adoption of SAB 101, nor has its adoption had a material impact on the Company's results of operations. Following the adoption of SAB 101, the amortization of deferred connection fee revenue and associated direct incremental costs is included in telephone service revenues and operating and maintenance expenses, respectively.       Other operating revenues, which include revenues generated from the provision of direct lines, operator services and other miscellaneous telephone service revenues, increased 17% to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2000.     Operating and Maintenance Expenses       Operating and maintenance expenses increased 3% to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. In functional currency terms, operating and maintenance expenses increased approximately 9% for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000, due to inflationary increases in costs. In U.S. dollar terms, however, the increase in such costs in functional currency terms has been offset by the 2% devaluation of the Hungarian forint between the periods and a reduction in the Company's U.S. dollar denominated operating expenses between the periods.                                        -33-         Depreciation and Amortization           Depreciation and amortization charges remained consistent at $9.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. Depreciation and amortization charges increased in functional currency terms by approximately 2% due to additional capital expenditures during the period.       Income from Operations           Income from operations increased 11% to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Contributing to such improvement were higher net telephone service revenues, partially offset by slightly higher operating and maintenance expenses.       Foreign Exchange Gains (Losses)           Foreign exchange gains amounted to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to foreign exchange losses of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The foreign exchange gains resulted primarily from the appreciation of the Hungarian forint against the Company's average EUR 84.3 million denominated debt outstanding during the period. At December 31, 2001, the Hungarian forint had appreciated in value by approximately 7% against the euro and by approximately 2% against the U.S. dollar as compared to January 1, 2001. Included in foreign exchange gains for the year ended December 31, 2001 is approximately $0.7 million of foreign exchange losses relating to the Company's foreign currency forward contracts. When non-Hungarian forint debt is re-measured into Hungarian forints, the Company reports foreign exchange gains/losses in its consolidated financial statements as the Hungarian forint appreciates/devalues against such non-forint currencies. See "- Inflation and Foreign Currency," and Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Market Risk Exposure."       Interest Expense           Interest expense decreased 27% to $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This $4.9 million decrease is attributable to lower interest rates paid on the Company's borrowings. The decrease results from the Company's medium-term credit facility entered into in April 2000, pursuant to which the Company's borrowings went from being mostly Hungarian forint denominated to mostly euro denominated, and the Company's weighted average interest rate on its debt obligations went from 10.70% for the year ended December 31, 2000, to 8.48% for the year ended December 31, 2001, a 21% decrease. Included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 is approximately $1.6 million of amortization of forward points on forward foreign currency contracts accounted for under SFAS 52. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 on January 1, 2001 and the foreign currency forward contracts the Company has entered into during 2001 do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined under SFAS 133 and SFAS 138.                                        -34-         Interest Income           Interest income decreased to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, primarily due to lower interest rates on Hungarian forint deposits during the period.       Net Income (Loss)           As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company recorded net income ascribable to common stockholders of $11.0 million, or $0.91 per share, or $0.89 per share on a diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to a net loss ascribable to common stockholders of $5.4 million, or $0.45 per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2000.  COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999           The Company's Hungarian subsidiaries' functional currency is the Hungarian forint. The average Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2000 was 281.10, as compared to an average Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 1999 of 238.08. This devaluation of the Hungarian forint against the U.S. dollar reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Hungarian forint during the period. When comparing the year ended December 31, 2000 to the year ended December 31, 1999, it should be noted that all U.S. dollar reported amounts have been affected by this 18% devaluation in the Hungarian subsidiaries' functional currency.       Net Revenues                                                         Year ended (dollars in millions)                               2000            1999 Measured service revenues                         $ 30.7          $ 35.2 Subscription revenues                               13.1            10.9 Net interconnect charges                           (6.5)           (7.0)                                                    -----           ----- Net measured service and subscription revenues      37.3            39.1 Connection fees                                      2.1             1.8 Other operating revenues, net                        3.6             4.5                                                    -----           ----- Telephone Service Revenues, Net                   $ 43.0          $ 45.4                                                   ======          ======           The Company recorded a 5% decrease in net telephone service revenues to $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.           Net measured service and subscription revenues decreased to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Measured service revenues decreased 13% to $30.7 million in 2000 from $35.2 million in 1999, while subscription revenues increased 20% to $13.1 million in 2000 from $10.9 million in 1999. Measured service revenues increased in functional currency terms by approximately 2% as a result of an increase in average access lines in service from approximately 190,000 lines for the year ended December 31, 1999 to approximately 202,400 lines for the year ended December 31, 2000, offset by an average 3.6% decrease in call tariffs between 1999 and 2000 as a result of tariff re-balancing which was introduced during 2000. Under tariff re-balancing, a more cost-driven payment structure is envisaged, with monthly subscription fees increasing to cover network infrastructure expenses over time. In Hungary, over the past several years, as                                        -35-    in many other countries, cheaper local call charges have been subsidized by expensive international and domestic long-distance calls. The overall effect on a gross revenue basis for the telecom industry, as a whole, is expected to be neutral. The increase in measured service revenues in functional currency terms, however, has been offset by the approximate 18% devaluation of the functional currency during the year and, therefore, measured service revenues show a 13% decrease year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms. Subscription revenues increased in functional currency terms by approximately 41% as a result of tariff re-balancing effective February 1, 2000, as well as the increase in average access lines in service. The increase in subscription revenues in functional currency terms, however, has been offset by the approximate 18% devaluation of the functional currency during the year and, therefore, subscription revenues show only a 20% increase in U.S. Dollar terms year-on-year.           These revenues have been reduced by net interconnect charges which totaled $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. As a percentage of call and subscription revenues, net interconnect charges have declined from 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 1999 to 14.8% for the year ended December 31, 2000.           Connection fees, which represent fees paid by customers to connect to the Company's networks, increased 17% for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $2.1 million from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company implemented the Securities and Exchange's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), with effect from January 1, 2000, which requires connection fees and corresponding direct incremental costs to be deferred and amortized over future periods. As a result of the implementation of SAB 101, certain connection fees and costs recognized in prior periods have been deferred and are being amortized over the estimated average subscriber life of 7 years. There was no cumulative effect on earnings from the adoption of SAB 101, nor has its adoption had a material impact on the Company's results of operations. Following the adoption of SAB 101, the amortization of deferred connection fee revenue and associated direct incremental costs is included in telephone service revenues and operating and maintenance expenses, respectively.           Other operating revenues, which include revenues generated from the provision of direct lines and other miscellaneous telephone service revenues, totaled $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, as compared to $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 1999.       Operating and Maintenance Expenses           Operating and maintenance expenses decreased 2% to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, as compared to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. In functional currency terms, operating and maintenance expenses increased 6%, excluding the effect of the change in accounting for connection fees and corresponding direct incremental costs, for the year ended December 31, 2000, as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase in functional currency terms is due to inflationary increases in costs at the Company's Hungarian subsidiaries, offset by savings related to reductions in the number of ex-patriates working for the Company.                                        -36-        Depreciation and Amortization           Depreciation and amortization charges decreased $2.4 million, or 20%, to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This decrease in U.S. Dollar terms is due to depreciation and amortization charges decreasing in functional currency terms by approximately 6% combined with the 18% devaluation of the Hungarian forint during the period. The 6% decrease in depreciation and amortization charges in functional currency terms is due to additional depreciation being recorded at two of the Company's subsidiaries during 1999 ($0.7 million at historical exchange rates) on certain network equipment. The equipment was replaced due to the subsidiaries' relinquishment of rights to use certain broadcasting frequencies, previously granted by TTW Ministry.      Income from Operations           Income from operations increased to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Contributing to such improvement were lower operating and maintenance expenses and lower depreciation and amortization charges.      Foreign Exchange Losses           Foreign exchange losses increased $2.0 million, net of a gain of $0.9 million related to the Company's forward hedging contracts, to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Such foreign exchange losses resulted primarily from the devaluation of the Hungarian forint against the U.S. dollar and euro during the period. This increase in foreign exchange losses during the period is also due to the Company's refinancing of its debt obligations in April 2000. Prior to its refinancing, approximately 20% of the Company's debt was denominated in currencies other than the Hungarian forint, whereas subsequent to its refinancing, the Company's debt is approximately 69% denominated in currencies other than the Hungarian forint. Therefore, when such non-forint debt is converted into Hungarian forints, the Company reports foreign exchange losses in its consolidated financial statements as the Hungarian forint devalues against such non-forint currencies during the reporting period. See "- Inflation and Foreign Currency," and Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Market Risk Exposure."       Interest Expense           Interest expense decreased 43% to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This $14.0 million decrease was partially attributable to lower average debt levels during the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999, due to the Company's restructuring of its debt obligations in May 1999 and the subsequent refinancing of those obligations in April 2000. As a result of the refinancing in April 2000, the Company's borrowings went from being mostly Hungarian forint denominated to mostly euro denominated. The decrease also reflects the lower interest rates paid on borrowings in U.S. dollars and euros, compared to Hungarian forints. As a result of the restructuring in May 1999 and the refinancing in April 2000, the Company's weighted average interest rate on its debt obligations went from 13.17% for the year ended December 31, 1999, to 10.70% for the year ended December 31, 2000, a 19% decrease. Included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 is approximately $1.6 million of                                        -37-    amortization of the forward points on the Company's forward foreign currency contracts. See "- Liquidity and Capital Resources."      Interest Income           Interest income decreased to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, primarily due to lower interest rates on Hungarian forint deposits during the period.      Loss Before Extraordinary Items           As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company recorded a loss before extraordinary items of $5.3 million, or $0.45 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to a loss before extraordinary items of $17.8 million, or $1.85 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1999.      Extraordinary Items, net           For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company recorded an extraordinary item, net of $20.9 million, comprised of a $9.0 million gain on extinguishment of the liabilities the Company had with Citizens and an $18.2 million gain on extinguishment of all amounts due under a contractor financing facility, offset in part by a non-cash charge of $6.3 million related to the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs and credits pertaining to the Original Postabank Credit Facility.      Net Income (Loss)                 As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company recorded a net loss ascribable to common stockholders of $5.4 million, or $0.45 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to net income ascribable to common stockholders of $3.1 million, or $0.33 per share for the year ended December 31, 1999.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           The Company has historically funded its capital requirements primarily through a combination of debt, equity and vendor financing. The ongoing development and installation of the network in each of the Company's operating areas required significant capital expenditures ($197 million at historical exchange rates through December 31, 2001). Since the end of 1998, the Company's networks have had the capacity, with only normal capital expenditure requirements, to provide basic telephone services to virtually all of the potential subscribers within its Operating Areas.           In 1996, the Company entered into a $170 million Credit Facility with Postabank (the "Original Postabank Credit Facility") and, during 1996 and 1997, the Company entered into several construction contracts with a contractor which totaled $59.0 million in the aggregate, $47.5 million of which was financed by a contractor financing facility. The contractor financed the construction through a facility provided by Postabank.           On May 12, 1999, the Company entered into various agreements as part of a revision of its capital structure with the following parties: Postabank; Tele Danmark; the Danish Fund; and CU CapitalCorp                                        -38-    and Citizens International Management Services Company, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Citizens (see Notes 5, 9 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result of such agreements, the Company extinguished all of its obligations (i) to Postabank under the Original Postabank Credit Facility; (ii) to the contractor under a contractor financing facility; and (iii) to Citizens. The effect of these transactions caused a significant reduction in the financial obligations of the Company. The Company simultaneously borrowed from Postabank $138 million (at historical exchange rates) under a one-year dual currency bridge loan agreement (the "Postabank Bridge Loan ") in Hungarian forints and euros and $25 million pursuant to certain unsecured notes which mature in 2007.           On April 11, 2000, the Company entered into an EUR 130 million Senior Secured Debt Facility Agreement (the "Debt Agreement" or "Credit Facility") with a European banking syndicate. The Company drew down EUR 129 million of the Facility on April 20, 2000 ($121 million at April 20, 2000 exchange rates), which funds were used, along with $7.3 million of other Company funds (at April 20, 2000 exchange rates), to pay off the entire outstanding EUR 134 million (approximately $126 million at April 20, 2000 exchange rates) principal and interest due on the Postabank Bridge Loan which was due to mature on May 12, 2000, and to pay fees associated with the Debt Agreement. The borrowers under the Debt Agreement are the Operating Companies (now merged into Hungarotel) who were the borrowers under the Postabank Bridge Loan. The Debt Agreement and some of the related agreements are further described below.           The Debt Agreement has two facilities. Facility A is a floating rate term loan in the amount of EUR 125 million (the "Term Facility") which principal is repayable in installments semi-annually on each June 30 and December 31 beginning on June 30, 2001 and ending on December 31, 2007. The amounts of the principal repayments on the Term Facility are to be escalating percentages of the amounts drawn down. The Company has borrowed the full EUR 125 million, of which EUR 84.1 million was funded in, an is repayable in, euros and the equivalent of EUR 40.9 million was funded in, and is repayable in, Hungarian forints. The portion of the Term Facility loan denominated in euros accrues interest at the rate of the Applicable Margin (defined below) plus the EURIBOR rate for the applicable interest period. The EURIBOR rate is the percentage rate per annum determined by the Banking Federation of the European Union for the applicable interest period. The portion of the Term Facility loan denominated in Hungarian forints accrues interest at the rate of the Applicable Margin (defined below) plus the BUBOR rate for the applicable interest period. The BUBOR rate is the percentage rate per annum determined according to the rules established by the Hungarian Forex Association and published by the National Bank of Hungary for the applicable interest period. The applicable interest period for the portion of the Term Facility loan denominated in euros is six months. The applicable interest period for the portion of Term Facility loan denominated in Hungarian forints is three months. Interest is payable at the end of each interest period. The Applicable Margin is initially 1.75%. The Applicable Margin may be adjusted downward incrementally to a minimum of 1.15%, subject to the financial performance of the Company as measured by the ratio of the Company's senior debt to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Dependent on its cash flow, the Company will be required to prepay the equivalent of $25 million on the Term Facility until such time as $25 million has been prepaid. The amount of the prepayment in any year shall be at least 50% of the Company's excess cash flow, if any, for the previous financial year as defined in the Debt Agreement. The prepayment amount is due within 15 days of the publication of each annual Form 10-K filing. As a result of the amendment to the Debt Agreement on November 9, 2001 described below, no such mandatory prepayment will be made by the Company in 2002.                                        -39-             Facility B is a floating rate revolving loan in the amount of EUR 5 million (the "Revolving Facility") which can only be drawn down in euros. The Revolving Facility was scheduled to be reduced to EUR 2.5 million on December 31, 2005. The Revolving Facility was originally available until December 31, 2007. The Company borrowed EUR 4 million of the Revolving Facility to pay off the balance of the Postabank Bridge Loan and fees associated with the transaction on April 20, 2000. The principal amount borrowed under the Revolving Facility is due at the end of each interest period at which point the Company could, subject to certain conditions, roll over the amount of principal borrowed. The applicable interest period for the Revolving Facility is, at the Company's option, one, three, or six months. The Company has chosen six months at the present time. Interest is payable at the end of each interest period calculated similarly to that for a Term Facility loan denominated in euros. On November 9, 2001, the Company and its bank lenders under the Debt Agreement amended the Debt Agreement. In connection with the amendment, the Company agreed to cancel, with immediate affect, the EUR 1 million undrawn portion of the Revolving Facility. At the same time, the Company also agreed to cancel the EUR 4 million revolving loan outstanding following the scheduled repayment of such principal and accrued interest in April 2002. After May 31, 2002, the Company may request that the banking syndicate reinstate the EUR 5 million Revolving Facility. However, any such reinstatement would be at the discretion of each member of the banking syndicate individually with regard to its original commitment at April 11, 2000. The amended agreement allows for those lenders participating in the reinstatement of the revolver to increase their individual commitments such that, in the aggregate, all of the lenders participating in the reinstated revolver could provide up to the original revolver amount of EUR 5 million.           The Company paid an arrangement fee in the amount of EUR 2,665,000 (approximately $2.5 million at April 20, 2000 exchange rates), which has been capitalized with other direct costs incurred in obtaining the Debt Agreement and is being amortized over the term of the related debt. In addition, an annual agency fee in the amount of $60,000 has also been paid. The Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee equal to the lower of 0.75% or 50% of the Applicable Margin on any available unused commitment on the Revolving Facility.           On November 9, 2001, the Company and its bank lenders amended the Debt Agreement. The amendment eliminated a covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum level of EBITDA, measured in Hungarian forints, each quarter and waived for the fourth quarter 2001 and first quarter of 2002 a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum senior debt service coverage ratio. In connection with the elimination and such waivers, the Company agreed to (i) make a payment by November 21, 2001 in the amount of approximately $7.9 million (at November 9, 2001 exchange rates) into escrow to cover the interest and principal repayment under the Debt Facility due December 31, 2001; (ii) between May 1, 2002 and May 12, 2002 pay the interest and principal due on June 30, 2002 under the Credit Facility into escrow; (iii) make a prepayment by November 21, 2001 of 5% of the original loan (approximately $5.6 million at November 9, 2001 exchange rates); (iv) immediately cancel the remaining EUR 1 million undrawn portion of the EUR 5 million revolver portion of the Debt Agreement (v) cancel the remaining portion (EUR 4 million) of the Revolving Facility following the repayment of such principal and accrued interest by the Company in April 2002; (vi) pay an additional 15 basis points of interest on the floating rate term loan portion of the Debt Agreement; and (vii) pay a waiver fee of EUR 195,000 to the banking syndicate.           The Company believes that its current cash flow would have allowed it to meet its working capital needs and continue its network development plans, as well as meet its obligations under the Debt Agreement prior to the Debt Agreement being amended. The amendment has enabled the Company to                                        -40-    significantly reduce its debt, thus positively re-balancing the Company's debt-to-equity ratio. The reduced interest payments as a result of the Company's reduced debt level are expected to positively affect the Company's net results in future periods.           The Company and Citibank Rt. (as security agent) have entered into a series of agreements to secure all of the Company's obligations under the Debt Agreement pursuant to which the Company has pledged all of its intangible and tangible assets, including HTCC's ownership interests in its subsidiaries, and its real property. The Company is subject to restrictive covenants, including restrictions regarding the ability of the Company to pay dividends, borrow funds, merge and dispose of its assets. The Debt Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary events of default, including those related to a change of control, which would trigger early repayment of the balance under the Debt Agreement. If, prior to the Trigger Date (the date on which for the prior two fiscal quarters the Company's debt to EBITDA ratio is less than 2.5 to 1), Tele Danmark sells any of the shares of Common Stock that it currently owns or Tele Danmark and the Danish Fund, together, no longer own 30.1% of the outstanding Common Stock, then an event of default shall have occurred. Tele Danmark and the Danish Fund currently own a combined total of 31.9% of the outstanding common stock. Following the Trigger Date, Tele Danmark can only transfer its shares with the prior written consent of banks holding at least 66.7% of the Company's outstanding debt under the Debt Agreement.           The Company had 12,103,180 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2001, which were held by the following parties in the percentages indicated: Postabank 20.1%; Tele Danmark 21.3%; the Danish Fund 10.6%; Citizens 19.1%; and others 28.9%. On a fully-diluted basis, the Company has 15,763,088 shares outstanding, which were held by the following parties in the percentages indicated: Postabank 31.3%; Tele Danmark 16.4%; the Danish Fund 8.2%; Citizens 16.5%; and others 27.6%.           Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company used $7.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively, in investing activities, which was primarily used to fund additions to the Company's telecommunications networks. Financing activities used net cash of $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.                                        -41-         The Company has the following major contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2001 (at December 31, 2001 exchange rates):                            Cash Payments Due by Period                                  (in thousands)                                    1 Year or                           After 5                                          -- Obligation              Total       Less       2-3 Years  4-5 Years     Years                         -----       ----       ---------  ---------     ----- Long Term Debt      $   117,193     12,311        31,338     38,054    35,490 Operating Leases          1,951        342           773        836         - Construction Commitments               2,792      1,456         1,336          -         -                         -------     ------        ------     ------    ------ Total               $   121,936     14,109        33,447     38,890    35,490                         =======     ======        ======     ======    ======       The Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its contractual cash obligations is subject to many factors, including regulatory developments, competition and customer behavior and acceptance of additional fixed line telecommunications services. Under the Debt Agreement, the Company must maintain certain levels of earnings before interest, foreign exchange gains/losses, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and cash flow in order to allow it to comply with its debt covenant ratios as set out in the Debt Agreement. The ratios are calculated based on the Company's U.S. dollar consolidated financial statements. This fact exposes the Company to the risk of not meeting its debt covenant ratios, as measured in U.S. dollar terms, due to the effect of currency movements on translation of its euro and Hungarian forint denominated assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars. While management seeks to manage the business to be in compliance with its Debt Agreement and related covenants, management operates in a regulated environment which is subject to many factors outside of its control (i.e. change in governing party and the party's political, social and public policy agenda). The Company's liquidity may also be affected by exchange rate fluctuations due to 73% of its debt not being denominated in Hungarian forints. The Company attempts to reduce this exchange rate risk, however, through its use of forward hedging contracts.  INFLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY       For the year ended December 31, 2001, inflation in Hungary was approximately 9.2% on an annualized basis. It is the stated policy goal of the Hungarian government to keep inflation from exceeding approximately 4.5% in 2002. In May 2001, the National Bank of Hungary widened the trading band the Hungarian forint is allowed to trade within from +/- 2.25% of the mid-point of the band to +/- 15%. This widening caused the Hungarian forint to initially appreciate in value against the euro by approximately 4%. Subsequent to the band widening, and without any notice, in June 2001 the National Bank of Hungary lifted all remaining foreign exchange restrictions concerning the Hungarian forint, thus making the Hungarian forint fully and freely convertible. The lifting of the restrictions initially caused a large amount of investment money to flow into the Hungarian markets and the Hungarian forint has appreciated in value against the euro during 2001. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company experienced large foreign exchange gains primarily related to the re-measurement of the Company's euro denominated debt, however due to fluctuations in the Hungarian forint exchange rate market, the Hungarian forint/euro exchange rate gave back much of its gains of the second quarter in the third quarter of 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recouped the foreign exchange loss it had incurred during the third quarter                                        -42-    of 2001. With the widening of the trading band as previously mentioned, the potential volatility of the Hungarian forint has increased as is evidenced by the exchange rate gains and losses the Company experienced during the last three quarters of 2001. The Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rate decreased to 279.03 as of December 31, 2001, as compared to an exchange rate of 284.73 as of December 31, 2000, an effective year-on-year appreciation of 2%. See Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Market Risk Exposure."       The Company's Hungarian operations generate revenues in Hungarian forints and incur operating and other expenses, including capital expenditures, predominately in Hungarian forints but also in U.S. dollars and euros. In addition, certain of the Company's balance sheet accounts are denominated in currencies other than the Hungarian forint, the Company's Hungarian subsidiaries' functional currency. Accordingly, when such accounts are translated into Hungarian forints, the Company is subject to foreign exchange gains and losses which are reflected as a component of net income or loss. When the Company and its subsidiaries' forint-denominated accounts are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, the Company is subject to translation adjustments, the effect of which is reflected as a component of stockholders' equity.       While the Company has the ability to increase the prices it charges for its services commensurate with increases in the Hungarian Consumer Price Index ("CPI") pursuant to its licenses from the Hungarian government, it may choose not to implement the full amount of the increase permitted due to competitive and other concerns. In addition, the rate of increase in the Hungarian CPI may not be sufficient to offset potential negative exchange rate movements and as a result, the Company may be unable to generate cash flows to the degree necessary to meet its obligation in currencies other than the Hungarian forint.  PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In July 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("Statement 141") was issued. Statement 141 eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and requires all business combinations initiated after this date to be accounted for using the purchase method. Statement 141 also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. The Company adopted the provisions of Statement 141 from July 1, 2001.       In July 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("Statement 142") was issued. Statement 142 will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provision of Statement 142. Statement 142 will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of."       Statement 142 sets forth certain transition provisions which include a requirement for the Company to assess whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption. To                                        -43-    accomplish this the Company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the date of adoption. The Company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit's carrying amount. To the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired and the Company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test. In the second step, the Company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of it assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with Statement 141, to its carrying amount, both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption. This second step is required to be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the year of adoption. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the Company's statement of earnings. The Company is required to implement Statement 142 on January 1, 2002. The Company is evaluating the impact Statement 142 may have on its financial position and results of operations.       In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations". SFAS 143 requires the Company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. The Company also records a corresponding asset, which is depreciated over the life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003. The Company does not expect this pronouncement will have a significant effect on its financial position and results of operations.       In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("Statement 144"), which supersedes both FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of (Statement 121) and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions (Opinion 30), for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion). Statement 144 retains the fundamental provisions in Statement 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with Statement 121. For example, Statement 144 provides guidance on how a long-lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment, establishes criteria for when a long-lived asset is held for sale, and prescribes the accounting for a long-lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale. Statement 144 retains the basic provisions of Opinion 30 on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity (rather than a segment of a business). Unlike Statement 121, an impairment assessment under Statement 144 will never result in a write-down of goodwill. Rather, goodwill is evaluated for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company is required to adopt Statement 144 no later than the year beginning after December 15, 2001, and plans to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending March 31, 2002. Management does not expect the adoption of Statement 144 for long-lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements because the impairment assessment under Statement 144 is largely unchanged from Statement                                        -44-    121. The provisions of the Statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities.        ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company is exposed to various types of risk in the normal course of its business, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes. Company operations, including all revenues and approximately 88% of operating expenses are Hungarian forint based and are therefore subject to exchange rate variability between the Hungarian forint and the U.S. dollar. In the past, the "crawling peg" policy of the Hungarian National Bank, combined with the +/- 2.25% trading band, allowed the Hungarian forint to be somewhat predictable versus the euro (e.g. the Hungarian forint/euro exchange rate went from 264.58 as of January 1, 2001 to 266.70 as of March 31, 2001). However, due to the lifting of all foreign exchange restrictions concerning the Hungarian forint and the volatility in euro/U.S. dollar exchange rates, Hungarian forint/euro and Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rate variability has increased. This increase in variability is evident by the fact that the Hungarian forint/euro exchange rate went from 257.75 as of September 30, 2001 to 246.33 as of December 31, 2001, an approximate 4% appreciation in value. At the same time, the Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rate went from 281.29 as of September 30, 2001 to 279.03 as of December 31, 2001, an approximate 1% appreciation in value.       The debt obligations of the Company are Hungarian forint, euro and U.S. dollar denominated. The interest rate on the Hungarian forint debt obligations is based on the Budapest Bank Offer Rate (BUBOR). The interest rates on the euro and U.S. dollar denominated obligations are based on EURIBOR and USD LIBOR, respectively. Over the medium to long term, the BUBOR rate is expected to follow inflation and devaluation trends and the Company does not currently believe it has any material interest rate risk on any of its Hungarian forint denominated debt obligations. If a 1% change in the BUBOR interest rate were to occur, the Company's interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $0.3 million annually based upon the Company's December 31, 2001 debt level. If a 1% change in EURIBOR interest rates were to occur, the Company's interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $0.7 million annually based upon the Company's December 31, 2001 debt level. If a 1% change in USD LIBOR interest rates were to occur, the Company's interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $0.3 million annually based upon the Company's December 31, 2001 debt level.       The Company is also exposed to exchange rate risk insofar as the Company has debt obligations in other than the functional currency of its majority owned Hungarian subsidiary. Given the Company's debt obligations, which include euro and U.S. dollar denominated debt, if a 5% change in Hungarian forint/euro exchange rates were to occur, the Company's exchange rate risk would increase or decrease by approximately $3.4 million annually based upon the Company's December 31, 2001 debt level. If a 5% change in Hungarian forint/U.S. dollar exchange rates were to occur, the Company's exchange rate risk would increase or decrease by approximately $1.3 million annually.       The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to exchange rate risks associated with cash payments in euro maturing within six months under the Company's long-term debt obligations. The forward contracts establish the exchange rates at which the Company will sell the contracted amount of Hungarian forints for euros at a future date. The Company utilizes forward contracts which are six months in duration and at maturity will either receive or pay the difference                                        -45-    between the contracted forward rate and the exchange rate at the settlement date.
