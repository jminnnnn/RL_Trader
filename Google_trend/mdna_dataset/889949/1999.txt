Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations  Introduction           HTCC  is  engaged  primarily  in the  provision  of  telecommunications services  through its  majority-owned  operating  subsidiaries,  KNC,  Raba-Com, Papatel  and   Hungarotel.   The  Company   earns   substantially   all  of  its telecommunications revenue from measured service fees, monthly line rental fees, connection fees, public pay telephone services and ancillary services (including charges for additional services purchased at the customer's discretion).           During 1996 and 1997 the  Company  embarked  on a  significant  network development  program which met its  substantial  demand  backlog,  increased the number of basic  telephone  access  lines in  service  and  modernized  existing facilities.  The  development  and  installation  of the  network in each of the Company's Operating Areas required significant capital expenditures.           The ability of the Company to generate  sufficient  revenues to satisfy cash  requirements  and become  profitable will depend upon a number of factors, including the Company's ability to attract  additional  customers,  revenues per customer  and  construction  costs.  These  factors are expected to be primarily influenced by the success of the Company's operating and marketing strategies as well as  market  acceptance  of  telecommunications  services  in the  Company's Operating  Areas. In addition,  the Company's  profitability  may be affected by changes in the  Company's  regulatory  environment  and other  factors  that are beyond the Company's control. The success of the Company's strategy is dependent upon its ability to increase  revenues through  increased usage and the addition of new subscribers.           To date, the Company's  activities have involved the acquisition of the concessions  and  telecommunications  networks  from  MATAV  and the  subsequent design,   development  and   construction   of  the  modern   telecommunications infrastructure  that  the  Company  now has in  service.  The  Company  paid the Ministry $11.5 million (at historical exchange rates) for its concessions, spent approximately  $23.2  million  (at  historical  exchange  rates) to acquire  the existing  telecommunications assets in its Operating Areas from MATAV, and spent $171 million  through  December 31, 1998 (at historical  exchange  rates) on the development and  construction of its  telecommunications  infrastructure.  Since commencing the provision of telecommunications  services in the first quarter of 1995, the Company's network construction and expansion program has added 123,600 access  lines  through  December 31, 1998 to the 61,400  access  lines  acquired directly  from MATAV.  As a result,  the Company  had  185,000  access  lines in operation at year end 1998.           The Company funded its  construction  costs primarily  through the $170 million  Postabank  Credit  Facility and a $47.5  million  contractor  financing facility.  The Company and the Hungarian contractor which granted the contractor financing  facility have a disagreement  with respect to several issues relating to the quality and quantity of the work done by the contractor.  During 1998 the Company and the contractor engaged in settlement  discussions but were unable to reach a settlement.  The Company is currently reviewing its options with respect to this dispute. See Item 3 "Legal  Proceedings",  and Note 9(e) of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.           The first installment of the repayment of the Postabank Credit Facility is due on March 31,  1999.  To date,  the Company has  suffered  from  recurring losses from  operations and has a working  capital  deficiency and a net capital deficiency.  The Company does not presently have sufficient funds on hand to pay the first  installment  on the Postabank  Credit  Facility.  Under the Postabank Credit  Facility,  a failure  to pay any  installment  constitutes  an "Event of Default".  Upon  notice to the  Company of an Event of  Default,  the Company is entitled to the benefit of a 60 day cure period. If such Event of Default is not cured within 60 days,  Postabank could declare all amounts outstanding under the Postabank Credit Facility due and payable upon 60 days notice.                                        -26-            The Company,  with assistance from its financial advisors, is currently in  negotiations  with  Postabank  and  its  financial   advisors   regarding  a restructuring  of the  Company's  obligations  with  the  goal of  reducing  the Company's cash repayment  obligations so that the Company can sufficiently  fund its working capital  requirements,  capital  expenditures and meet its financing obligations  with cash  flows from  operations.  The  Company is also  reviewing various other financing alternatives with several entities.  While the result of such  negotiations  and the  availability  of  alternative  sources of financing cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that it will be able to resolve  its  financial  issues so that it will be able to meet its  obligations during 1999. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to resolve  these  issues  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  or  at  all.  Such negotiations  and/or  discussions  could result in the issuance of equity and/or debt  securities  of the Company or one or more of the Operating  Companies.  In addition,  the Company  relies on its ability to generate  cash from  operations which is dependent upon the Company's  ability to attract  additional  customers and increase  revenues per customer.  These factors are expected to be primarily influenced by the success of the Company's operating and marketing strategies as well as market acceptance of the Company's services.           These factors raise  substantial  doubt about the Company's  ability to continue  as a going  concern.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.           The Company  has granted  various  options to  purchase  the  Company's Common Stock,  including those previously granted to Citizens,  and has provided certain  preemptive  rights to Citizens and Tele Danmark.  For the term of these options,  the  holders  will have the  opportunity  to  exercise  and dilute the interests  of other  security  holders  or, in the case of  Citizens,  acquire a controlling   interest  in  the  Company.   As  long  as  these  options  remain unexercised,  the Company's  ability to obtain  additional equity capital may be adversely affected.                                         -27-    Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 1998 to Year Ended December 31, 1997       Net Revenues                                                                              Year ended         (dollars in millions)                                    1998            1997         Measured service revenues                              $ 32.2          $ 26.2         Subscription revenues                                    10.7             7.2         Net interconnect charges                                 (9.8)         (10.2)                                                                 ------         ------         Net measured service and subscription revenues           33.1            23.2         Connection fees                                           2.0            12.9         Other operating revenues, net                             3.6             1.8                                                                 ------         ------         Telephone Service Revenues, Net                        $ 38.7          $ 37.9                                                                =======         =======            The Company recorded a 2.1% increase in net telephone  service revenues to $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.           Net measured service and subscription revenues increased 42.7% to $33.1 million for the year ended  December  31,  1998 from $23.2  million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  Measured  service  revenues  increased  22.9% to $32.2 million in 1998 from $26.2 million in 1997 while subscription revenues increased 48.6% to $10.7  million in 1998 from $7.2  million in 1997.  These  increases in call and  subscription  fee revenues are the result of a 35% increase in average access  lines in service  from  approximately  132,000  lines for the year ended December 31, 1997 to approximately 178,000 lines for the year ended December 31, 1998.  The growth in access lines is not fully  reflected in increased  measured service  revenues  as newer  customers  require  a  period  of  maturity  before producing revenues similar to established telephone customers.           These  revenues  have been  offset by net  interconnect  charges  which totaled $9.8  million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to $10.2 million  for the year ended  December  31,  1997.  As a  percentage  of call and subscription  revenues,  net interconnect charges have declined from 31% for the year ended December 31, 1997 to 23% for the year ended December 31, 1998, due to a higher  proportion of local  traffic as additional  access lines are placed in service plus a negotiated  reduction in interconnect  fees effective  January 1, 1998. Based upon recent  negotiations  with MATAV and the Hungarian  Ministry of Telecommunications,  the Company  expects net  interconnect,  as a percentage of call and subscription revenues, to decrease in 1999.           Connection  fees for the year ended  December  31,  1998  totaled  $2.0 million as compared to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  This decrease reflects the reduction in the number of new access lines connected from approximately  81,700 during the year ended  December 31, 1997 to  approximately 9,900  lines  during the year ended  December  31,  1998.  Connection  fees were expected to decline substantially during the year as the majority of wait-listed customers have been provided with access lines.  The Company expects  connection fees to continue to decline as no significant  backlog of wait-listed  customers exists.           Other operating revenues increased 100% to $3.6 million during the year ended  December 31, 1998 compared to $1.8 million during the year ended December 31,  1997 due to  revenues  generated  from the  provision  of direct  lines and revenues generated from Lucent PBX sales and related maintenance  services.  The Company does not expect as large of an increase in other  operating  revenues in 1999 as was experienced in 1998.                                         -28-        Operating and Maintenance Expenses           Operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 1998 decreased to $19.6 million compared to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. On a per line basis,  operating and maintenance  expenses decreased to approximately  $110 per average access line for the year ended December 31, 1998 from  $190  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1997 as the  Company  achieved productivity  improvements,  including  discontinuing the use of labor intensive manual switchboards through the use of modern switching  technology,  as well as increased  focus on reducing  operating  expenses.  The Company  does not expect significant decreases in operating and maintenance expenses in 1999. However, on a per line basis,  operating  and  maintenance  costs are expected to decline as additional access lines are added during 1999.       Termination of Management Services Agreement           For the year ended  December  31, 1998,  the Company  recorded a charge totaling  $11.1  million  representing  the  present  value of  payments  due to Citizens  International  Management  Services  Company under a  termination  and consulting agreement. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       Depreciation and Amortization           Depreciation  and amortization  charges  increased to $11.6 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 from $8.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997. The Company expects  depreciation and amortization  charges in 1999 to increase in functional currency terms due to additional capital  expenditures in its operating  subsidiaries,  however,  in U.S. Dollar terms the Company expects depreciation  and  amortization  to remain  consistent  with 1998 amounts due to devaluation of the operating subsidiaries' functional currency.       Management Fees           Management fees pursuant to management service agreements  decreased to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  This decrease was due to the termination of management services  agreement  between the Company and Citizens  International  Management Services Company. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not have any continuing management services agreement.       Loss from Operations           Loss from  operations  increased  to $6.1  million  for the year  ended December 31, 1998 compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Excluding  the  cost  of  terminating  the  management  services  agreement  and management  fees,  income from  operations for the years ended December 31, 1998 and  1997  would  have  been  $7.6  million  and  $4.5  million,   respectively. Contributing to such  improvements  were higher revenues and lower operating and maintenance  expenses during the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997, offset by increased  depreciation and amortization charges during the year       Foreign Exchange Loss           Foreign  exchange  losses  decreased to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $0.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  Such foreign  exchange losses  resulted from the devaluation of the Hungarian  Forint against the U.S. Dollar and the German Mark.                                         -29-        Interest Expense           Interest expense increased to $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  This increase was  attributable  to higher  average debt levels during the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 as the Company incurred additional   indebtedness   in  order  to  continue  the   construction  of  its telecommunications   networks  and  repay  other  loan   obligations.   Interest capitalized and included in the cost of construction of certain long term assets amounted to approximately  $0.3 million during 1998 and $4.5 million in 1997. As stated  above,  the Company is  presently in  negotiations  to  restructure  its current debt agreements.      Other, net           Other,  net income amounted to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31,  1998 as  compared to $13,000 for the year ended  December  31,  1997.  This increase  during the year ended December 31, 1998 is due to an approximate  $0.8 million  gain  realized  related to the  termination  of the  former  management services  agreement  between the Company and Citizens  International  Management Services Company.  Under such termination  agreement,  the Company satisfied its obligations,  under a previous management services agreement, of $9.6 million by issuing  100,000 shares of Common Stock valued at $513,000 and a promissory note in the amount of $8.4 million.  See Note 14 of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial Statements.       Net Loss           As a result of the factors  discussed above, the Company recorded a net loss of $50.6 million,  or $9.53 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared  to a net loss of $36.2  million,  or $7.97 per share,  for the year ended December 31, 1997.  Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 1997 to Year Ended December 31, 1996       Net Revenues                                                                         Year ended         (dollars in millions)                               1997            1996         Measured service revenues                           $ 26.2         $ 20.5         Subscription revenues                                  7.2            3.8         Net interconnect charges                             (10.2)          (8.9)                                                            -------         -------         Net measured service and subscription revenues        23.2           15.4         Connection fees                                       12.9            4.1         Other operating revenues, net                          1.8            1.4                                                            -------         -------         Telephone Service Revenues, Net                     $ 37.9         $ 20.9                                                            =======         =======            The  Company  recorded  an  81.3%  increase  in net  telephone  service revenues  to $37.9  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  1997 from $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.           Net measured service and subscription revenues increased 50.7% to $23.2 million for the year ended  December  31,  1997 from $15.4  million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  Measured  service  revenues  increased  27.8% to $26.2 million in 1997 from $20.5 million in 1996 while subscription revenues increased 89.5% to $7.2 million in 1997 from $3.8 million in 1996. These increases in call and subscription fee revenues are the result of a 74% increase in average access lines in service from approximately 76,000 lines for the year ended December 31, 1996 to  approximately  132,000  lines for the year ended  December 31, 1997. In addition,  approximately 28,000 lines, representing 35% of the total increase in access lines in 1997, were placed in service during the fourth quarter of 1997.                                        -30-             These  revenues  have been  offset by net  interconnect  charges  which totaled $10.2  million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 as compared to $8.9 million  for the year ended  December  31,  1996.  As a  percentage  of call and subscription  revenues,  net interconnect charges have declined from 37% for the year ended December 31, 1996 to 31% for the year ended December 31, 1997, due to a higher  proportion of local  traffic as additional  access lines are placed in service.           Connection  fees for the year ended  December  31, 1997  totaled  $12.9 million as compared to $4.1 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  This increase  reflects the  connection  of 81,700 access lines during the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the  connection  of 28,200  access lines during the year ended December 31, 1996.           Other  operating  revenues  increased  28.6% to $1.8 million during the year ended  December  31, 1997  compared to $1.4  million  during the year ended December 31, 1996 due to higher  revenues  from the  provision of direct  lines, telephone leasing, PBX and telephone sales.       Operating and Maintenance Expenses           Operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased to $25.0 million compared to $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1996. On a per line basis,  operating and maintenance  expenses decreased to approximately  $190 per average access line for the year ended December 31, 1997 from  $285  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1996 as the  Company  achieved productivity improvements, including the decreased use of labor intensive manual switchboards and the increased use of modern switching technology.       Depreciation and Amortization           Depreciation and amortization charges increased to $8.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from $4.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996. This increase was due to the substantial  increase in property,  plant and equipment  placed in  service  in 1997 as a result of the  network  construction program.                                          -31-         Management Fees           Management fees pursuant to management service agreements  decreased to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  This decrease was due primarily to the  termination of certain management agreements with Tele Danmark in August 1996.       Asset Write-downs           During the year ended  December 31, 1996,  the Company  recorded  asset write-downs  totaling $2.0 million,  which represented the  decommissioning  and write-off of redundant assets as a result of the network construction in 1996.       Cost of Termination of Former Officers and Directors           During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company  recorded a charge totaling $6.3 million representing the present value of payments due and options granted to former  executive  officers and directors under separate  termination and release agreements, consulting agreements and noncompetition agreements.       Loss from Operations           Loss from  operations  decreased  to $1.3  million  for the year  ended December  31,  1997 from a loss from  operations  of $20.6  million for the year ended  December  31,  1996.  Adjusted  for  asset  write-downs  and the  cost of termination of former officers and directors,  the loss from operations  totaled $12.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  The  decreasing  operating loss in 1997 was  principally  due to the  additional  revenue  generated by the network  development  program,  offset by increases in operating and maintenance and depreciation expenses.       Foreign Exchange Loss           Foreign  exchange  losses  decreased to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $6.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  Such foreign  exchange losses  resulted from the devaluation of the Hungarian  Forint against  the U.S.  Dollar and the  German  Mark.  The  decrease  in the  foreign exchange  loss is due to a significant  reduction in debt and other  obligations denominated in U.S. Dollars and German Marks.       Interest Expense           Interest expense increased to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.  This increase was  attributable  to higher  average debt levels during the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 as the Company incurred additional  indebtedness in order to fund construction of its telecommunications networks.  Interest  capitalized  and  included in the cost of  construction  of certain long term assets amounted to approximately  $4.5 million during 1997 and $2.1 million in 1996.           Included  in  interest  expense in 1996 is $4.9  million,  the value of consideration  provided to Citizens for  assistance in fulfilling  the Company's obligations under the Citicorp Credit Facility (as defined herein).  See Notes 5 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                         -32-        Interest Income           Interest  income  decreased to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $1.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  This decrease is due to decreased average cash balances outstanding during 1997.       Abandonment of Financing           During  the year  ended  1996,  the  Company  canceled  a planned  bond offering in favor of a Hungarian Bank Credit Facility.  The costs of abandonment of financing  were $3.0 million and included  $2.0 million in settlement of fees and costs of the underwriter and $1.0 million for professional  fees and various out of pocket expenses.       Other, net           Other,  net income decreased to $13,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997 from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 principally due to a decrease in non-operating income and ancillary services.       Loss Before Extraordinary Items           As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company recorded a loss before  extraordinary  items of $36.2 million,  or $7.97 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1997 compared to a loss before  extraordinary  items of $47.5 million, or $11.38 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1996.       Extraordinary Item           The Company did not record any extraordinary  items in 1997 as compared to the year ended  December  31,  1996,  during  which the  Company  recorded an extraordinary  item of $7.3  million,  $1.76 per share,  comprised of a non-cash charge of $8.2 million  related to the  write-off of the  remaining  unamortized deferred  financing costs pertaining to the Citizens Loan Agreements,  offset by extraordinary income of $0.9 million relating to a gain on early retirement of a vendor credit  facility.  See Notes 5 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements.       Net Loss           As a result of the factors  discussed above, the Company recorded a net loss of $36.2 million,  or $7.97 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to a net loss of $54.8  million,  or $13.14 per share,  for the year ended December 31, 1996.  Liquidity and Capital Resources           The Company has historically funded its capital requirements  primarily through  a  combination  of debt,  equity  and  vendor  financing.  The  ongoing development and  installation of the network in each of the Company's  operating areas  required  significant  capital  expenditures  ($171 million at historical exchange rates through December 31, 1998).  The Company's  networks now have the capacity, with some additional capital expenditures,  to provide basic telephone services to virtually  all of the  potential  subscribers  within its  Operating Areas.           In 1995 the Company  entered into a financing  agreement  with Citizens pursuant to which Citizens guaranteed a $33.2 million loan from Chemical Bank in November  1995.  During  February  and March 1996,  the Company  borrowed  $18.2 million under a second financing agreement with Citizens.                                         -33-            On March 29, 1996,  the Company  entered into a $75.0  million  Secured Term Loan Credit Facility (the "Citicorp  Credit  Facility") and,  together with HTCC  Consulting,  a related  Pledge and Security  Agreement with Citicorp North America,  Inc.  ("Citicorp").  On April 3, 1996,  the Company used $50.8 million from the Citicorp  Credit Facility to repay all the funds advanced or guaranteed by  Citizens  and  Chemical  Bank.  As of such date,  all loan  agreements  with Citizens and Chemical  Bank were  terminated.  Accordingly,  in April 1996,  the Company  incurred a non-cash charge of approximately  $8.2 million  representing the  remaining  unamortized  deferred  financing  costs  pertaining  to the loan agreements with Citizens.           In order  to meet  contractual  commitments  pursuant  to  construction contracts  in  addition  to ongoing  operating  expenses,  the  Company  used an additional $24.0 million from the Citicorp Credit Facility.           On October 15, 1996,  the Company  entered into a $170 million  10-year Multi-Currency  Credit  Facility  with  Postabank.  Proceeds  from the Postabank Credit Facility may be drawn entirely in Hungarian  Forints and up to 20% of the principal  may be drawn in U.S.  Dollars  through  March 31, 1999.  Drawdowns in Hungarian Forints bear interest at a rate of 2.5% above the average of the yield on six- and twelve-month  discounted Hungarian treasury bills while drawdowns in U.S. Dollars bear interest at 2.5% above LIBOR. Interest for the first two years has been  deferred at the Company's  option.  Amounts  outstanding  in Hungarian Forints,  including  any deferred  interest,  are payable in 32 equal  quarterly installments beginning on March 31, 1999.           In October 1996,  the Company  borrowed the equivalent of $82.3 million in Hungarian  Forints under the Postabank Credit Facility.  Approximately  $75.2 million of this amount was used to repay Citicorp all funds advanced pursuant to the Citicorp  Credit  Facility,  as amended,  and $2.0 million in fees and costs representing  settlement in connection  with the  cancellation  of the Company's proposed private  placement of debt  securities.  The remaining $5.1 million was used to pay management fees and reimbursable  costs owed to Citizens pursuant to the Management  Services Agreement with Citizens.  An additional $5.6 million of the facility was used to pay loan  origination fees and costs to Postabank under the terms of the loan agreement, $2 million of which are being reimbursed to the Company in equal  quarterly  installments  over a two year period,  and is being amortized over the life of the loan facility. The remainder of the proceeds have been used to complete construction of the Company's  telecommunication networks, provide additional  working capital,  and refinance or repay other existing debt obligations.  As of December 31, 1998,  the Company had borrowed the entire $170 million under the Postabank Credit Facility.           In 1996,  the  Company's  subsidiary  Hungarotel  entered  into a $47.5 million construction contract for the construction of a telephone network with a capacity of 40,000 lines in its Bekescsaba service area.  Financing was provided by the contractor for the full contract amount. The financing agreement requires repayment in 20 quarterly installments  commencing on March 31, 1998, with final payment due December 31, 2002.  Interest is charged at a variable  rate computed as the weighted average of the six and 12 month Hungarian National Treasury Bill interest  rate for each  quarter  plus 2.5%.  The  Company  may  elect,  and has elected,  to defer repayment of 20% of the total debt repayments due in 1998 and 1999.           In 1995, the Company  applied for network  construction  subsidies from the  Hungarian   government.   In  December  1995,   certain  of  the  Company's applications were approved, subject to certain conditions, which resulted in the Company being awarded subsidies  aggregating $0.9 million.  The Company received such  subsidies  in  installments  in the  fourth  quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997. One-half of such funds were received in the form of a grant and one-half in the form of a non-interest  bearing loan repayable over a three year period beginning in 1997.                                        -34-            Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $11.1 million for the year  ended  December  31,  1998  compared  to $4.9  million  for the year ended December 31, 1997.  For the years ended  December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company used $15.6 million and $73.3  million,  respectively,  in investing  activities, which  was   primarily   used  to  fund  the   construction   of  the  Company's telecommunications  networks.  Financing  activities  provided  net cash of $9.3 million  and $58.4  million  for the years  ended  December  31,  1998 and 1997, respectively.  Inflation and Foreign Currency           For the  year  ended  December  31,  1998,  inflation  in  Hungary  was approximately  12% on an annualized  basis.  It is the stated policy goal of the Hungarian government to keep inflation from exceeding approximately 9% in 1999.           The  Company's  Hungarian  operations  generate  revenues in  Hungarian Forints and incur operating and other expenses,  including capital expenditures, predominately  in  Hungarian  Forints but also in U.S.  Dollars.  The  Company's resulting foreign currency exposure is difficult to hedge due to the significant costs involved and the lack of a market for such hedging.  In addition,  certain of the  Company's  balance sheet  accounts are  expressed in foreign  currencies other than the Hungarian Forint, the Company's functional currency. Accordingly, when such accounts are converted into Hungarian Forints,  the Company is subject to foreign  exchange  gains and losses which are reflected as a component of net income  or  loss.  When the  Company  and its  subsidiaries'  Forint-denominated accounts are translated into U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes,  the Company is subject to translation adjustments,  the effect of which is reflected as a component of stockholders' deficiency.           While the Company has the ability to increase the prices it charges for its services  commensurate with increases in the Hungarian  Consumer Price Index ("CPI")  pursuant to its licenses from the Hungarian  government,  it may choose not to implement the full amount of the increase  permitted  due to  competitive and other concerns.  In addition,  the rate of increase in the Hungarian CPI may be less than the rate at which the Hungarian Forint devalues.  As a result,  the Company may be unable to generate cash flows to the degree necessary to meet its obligation in currencies other than the Hungarian Forint.  Year 2000           In 1998 the  Company  initiated  a project  designed  to  identify  and mitigate Year 2000 computer  deficiencies.  The Company formed a Year 2K project team  (the  "Project  Team")  with  the  mandate  to  identify   problems,   set methodologies  for resolution,  and budget expenses all in order to minimize the impact of any Y2K problems from the Company's computer systems.           The Project  Team  consists  of  employees  from  senior and  mid-level management from various business units within the Company. The Project Team also includes several of the Company's computer  technicians and representatives from the systems' vendors. The Project Team has 10 permanent members from the Company and 3 permanent  members from the switching and billing  system  vendors.  Other vendors are  consulted  on an "as  needed"  basis.  The  Company  also formed an oversight committee comprised of senior management to oversee the Y2K issue.                                        -35-            The  Project  Team  is  examining  the   Company's   telecommunications networks, IT business systems, and miscellaneous support systems.  These systems include computers that support  telephone  services,  bill production,  customer accounting,  plant  records,  payroll,  and a  variety  of  systems  such as air conditioners  and building entry systems.  The project has five primary  phases: (I)  inventory,  (II)  assessment,  (III)  remediation,  (IV)  testing  and  (V) contingency planning and certification. Phase I is complete and consisted of the development  of a  comprehensive  working list which  documents all software and microprocessor  reliant  materials  used by the  Company to ensure that phase II covers the entire  population  of  potential  Y2K issues.  Phase II consisted of evaluating  the inventory list developed  during Phase I and  determining  which systems need  replacement,  modification or retirement  during 1999. Phase II is complete.  Phase III is  currently  underway  and  consists of  replacing  those hardware and  software  components  identified  as  non-compliant  and should be completed by the middle of the second  quarter 1999. At this time,  some systems have already been  modified to make them Y2K  compliant  and other  systems have been placed on retirement  schedules.  Major switching  components are scheduled for  replacement in April,  May and June of this year.  Phase IV will consist of testing  of  existing  and new  hardware  and  software  components  and will be completed during the second and third quarters of this year. Phase V consists of developing  a  written  plan for  alternative  methods  of  completing  critical processes should failure occur at the turn of the century. Contingency plans are being developed  currently for all systems.  Written  contingency  plans will be provided  to the  employees  by  September.  The  Company  will begin  awareness campaigns  to draw  employee and customer  attention to the  potential  problems associated with Y2K by April 1, 1999.           The Company  relies upon its  network  construction  vendors to provide compliant  hardware and software.  The Project Team believes that  compliance of the telephone  switching systems and the automatic message accounting  interface with the  billing  system  present the most  significant  Y2K  exposure  for the Company. In cooperation with  representatives  from the switch manufacturers who are active  members of the Project  Team,  the Project Team has developed a plan for Y2K Compliance of the switching  systems.  The switching system vendors have provided  the Company  with  delivery  schedules  that will bring the  switching systems  into  compliance  by  June of  this  year,  at  which  time  compliance certificates will be issued by the vendors.  Compliance of the switching systems by June  should  allow  sufficient  time to test  the  switching/billing  system Automatic Message  Accounting  ("AMA") interface and allow problems to be solved in a timely manner before the turn of the century.                                        -36-             The  Company  relies  upon  MATAV's  telecommunication  network for all long-distance  interconnections.  Should MATAV's telephone  switching systems be non-Y2K  compliant,  the systems  could fail  resulting  in lost revenue for the Company.  The  Company  is  working  directly  with  MATAV to reduce the risk of failure.  A  member  of the  Project  Team  employed  by  one  of the  Company's telecommunications  switching  vendors also sits on MATAV's Y2K committee and is actively  involved  in the issue.  The  Company  believes  that no costs will be incurred  related to this  matter.  MATAV will also  provide  the  Company  with certification for the 2MB backbone of the Company's internal wide area network.           The  Company's  recently  implemented  Billing and Customer Care system (BACC)  is Y2K  compliant  according  to its  vendor,  representatives  of which participate  on the Project Team.  During phase IV of the program,  beginning in April, and following the upgrades of the Company's  switching systems,  the BACC system  will be fully  tested in  cooperation  with the  vendor  to  ensure  Y2K compliance  has been  reached.  The vendor will issue a  compliance  certificate following successful completion of these tests.           Various  other IT  systems  have  been  identified  to be  replaced  or upgraded in association with the Company's efforts to become Y2K compliant.  The Company  believes  that all such systems will have  completed  all phases of the project  by the  end  of the  third  quarter  of  1999.  The  Company  maintains approximately 2 million lines of computer code developed  internally  which will be tested and modified by the end of the third quarter.           The Company  currently  estimates  that the total costs of  remediation will be approximately $785,000, which includes the replacement and/or upgrade of certain  equipment.  $630,000  of such cost will  allow the  Company  to provide additional services in addition to bringing the Company into Y2K compliance.  At this time,  no material  costs have been  incurred  for  remediation  of the Y2K problem.  It is expected that most costs will be incurred  during the second and third quarters of 1999.  Management  cannot provide assurance that the result of the project or that the remediation costs will not be materially  different from estimates.  Accordingly,  contingency  plans are  currently  being  developed to address high-risk systems.  The contingency plans are expected to be in place by the third quarter of 1999.           The Company is dependent  on network  switch  manufacturers  to provide compliant  hardware and software in a timely  manner.  Within IT, the Company is dependent  on  the  development  of  software  by  external  experts,   and  the availability of critical resources with the requisite skill sets. At worst case, failure by the Company or by certain of its vendors to remediate Y2K  compliance issues  could  result  in  disruption  of  the  Company's  operations,  possibly impacting its  telecommunication  network and the Company's  ability to bill and collect revenues.  However, management believes that this worst case scenario is unlikely, and that its efforts to mitigate Y2K issues will be successful.  Prospective Accounting Pronouncements           In June 1998,  Statement of Financial  Account Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"),  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities",  was issued.  SFAS 133 established  accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging  activities.  SFAS requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair  value.  SFAS 133 is  effective  for all fiscal  quarters  of fiscal  years beginning  after June 15,  1999.  SFAS 133 cannot be  applied  retroactively  to financial  statements of prior periods. At the current time the Company does not utilize  derivative  instruments  and  accordingly  it is  anticipated  that the adoption  of  SFAS  133  will  not  have a  material  impact  on  the  Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.           The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position No. 98-1 (SOP 98-1)  "Accounting for the Costs of Computer  Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," and Statement of Position No. 98-5 (SOP 98-5) "Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities" in 1998. SOP 98-1 requires that  certain  costs  related to the  development  or purchase  of  internal-use software be  capitalized  and amortized  over the  estimated  useful life of the software.  SOP 98-5 requires costs of start-up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred. The Company is required to adopt both new statements in the first quarter of 1999.  The adoption of these  statements is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  Market Risk Exposure                                         -37-               The Company is exposed to various types of risk in the normal course of its  business,  including  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate fluctuations  and interest  rate  changes.  Company  operations,  including  all revenues and  approximately  75% of operational costs are Hungarian Forint based and are  therefore  subject to exchange rate  variability  between the Hungarian Forint and U.S.  Dollar.  This  variability  is  mitigated  by several  factors, including  the Hungarian  National Bank policy to peg the Hungarian  Forint to a currency  basket and the  telecommunications  pricing  law. The  "crawling  peg" policy of the National Bank of Hungary  maintains a scheduled daily  devaluation of the Hungarian  Forint through a currency  basket  consisting of 70% Euros and 30% U.S.  Dollars.  The Hungarian Forint is allowed to trade within 2.25% of the mid-point of this trading band. As of Mid-March  1999, the Hungarian  government devaluation policy is 0.6% per month, totaling  approximately 7.4% for the year. The  telecommunications  pricing law allows  prices to increase by the  Consumer Price Index (CPI)  adjusted for an  efficiency  factor of up to 2%. Thus, to the extent that adjusted CPI follows  devaluation,  revenues are somewhat  insulated from exchange rate risk.           The debt  obligations  of the  Company  are  primarily  denominated  in Hungarian Forint.  The interest rate on the Hungarian Forint debt obligations is based on the  weighted  average of the  Hungarian  National  Bank 6 month and 12 month  Treasury  Bill  rates.  Over the  medium to long  term,  these  rates are expected to follow  inflation  and  devaluation  trends and the Company does not currently  believe  it has any  material  interest  rate risk on any of its debt obligations.  If a 1% change in  interest  rates  were to occur,  the  Company's interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $2.25 million based upon the Company's current debt level. However, should the Company refinance its debt  obligations in a currency other than the Hungarian  Forint,  exchange rate risk could increase.                 Item 8.
