Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations  Introduction           HTCC  is  engaged  primarily  in the  provision  of  telecommunications services  through its  majority-owned  operating  subsidiaries,  KNC,  Raba-Com, Papatel  and   Hungarotel.   The  Company   earns   substantially   all  of  its telecommunications revenue from measured service fees, monthly line rental fees, connection fees, public pay telephone services and ancillary services (including charges for additional services purchased at the customer's discretion).           During 1996 and 1997 the  Company  embarked  on a  significant  network development  program which met its  substantial  demand  backlog,  increased the number of basic  telephone  access  lines in  service  and  modernized  existing facilities.  The  development  and  installation  of the  network in each of the Company's Operating Areas required significant capital expenditures.           Now that the Company's network is substantially  built-out, the ability of the Company to generate  sufficient revenues to satisfy cash requirements and become profitable will depend upon a number of factors,  including the Company's ability to attract  additional  customers,  revenues  per  customer and on-going construction costs. These factors are expected to be primarily influenced by the success of the Company's  operating  and marketing  strategies as well as market acceptance of  telecommunications  services in the Company's Operating Areas. In addition,  the  Company's  profitability  may  be  affected  by  changes  in the Company's regulatory environment and other factors that are beyond the Company's control.  The success of the Company's strategy is dependent upon its ability to increase revenues through increased usage and the addition of new subscribers.           The Company  funded its  construction  costs and working  capital needs over the past several years primarily  through a $170 million  Postabank  Credit Facility  (the  "Original  Postabank  Credit  Facility")  and  a  $47.5  million contractor  financing facility.  The Company and the Hungarian  contractor which granted the contractor  financing  facility have a disagreement  with respect to several  issues  relating to the  quality  and  quantity of the work done by the contractor.  In addition, on March 31, 1999, the Company did not have sufficient funds on hand to pay the first installment due on the Original  Postabank Credit Facility. Due to this fact, as well as the disagreement the Company has with the Hungarian  contractor,  on March 30, 1999, and May 12, 1999, the Company entered into a  series  of  transactions  (see  notes  4,  5,  6, 8 and 11 of  Notes  to Consolidated  Financial  Statements)  which  restructured the Company's debt and capital  structure.  As  the  final  step  in  the  Company's  debt  and  equity restructuring which started in 1999, on April 11, 2000, the Company entered into a EUR  130  million  Senior  Secured  Debt  Facility  with  a  European  banking syndicate. See "- Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.           To date, the Company's  activities have involved the acquisition of the concessions  and  telecommunications  networks  from  Matav  and the  subsequent design,   development  and   construction   of  the  modern   telecommunications infrastructure  that  the  Company  now has in  service.  The  Company  paid the Ministry $11.5 million (at historical exchange rates) for its concessions, spent approximately  $23.2  million  (at  historical  exchange  rates) to acquire  the existing  telecommunications assets in its Operating Areas from Matav, and spent $181 million  through  December 31, 1999 (at historical  exchange  rates) on the development and  construction of its  telecommunications  infrastructure.  Since commencing the provision of telecommunications  services in the first quarter of 1995, the Company's network construction and expansion program has added 139,100 access  lines  through  December 31, 1999 to the 61,400  access  lines  acquired directly  from Matav.  As a result,  the Company  had  200,500  access  lines in operation at year end 1999.                                        -32-    Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 1999 to Year Ended December 31, 1998      Net Revenues                                                             Year ended       (dollars in millions)                            1999            1998       Measured service revenues                      $ 35.2          $ 32.2       Subscription revenues                            10.9            10.7       Net interconnect charges                         (7.0)           (9.8)                                                       -----           -----       Net measured service and subscription revenues   39.1            33.1       Connection fees                                   1.8             2.0       Other operating revenues, net                     4.5             3.6                                                       -----           -----       Telephone Service Revenues, Net                 $45.4           $38.7                                                       ======          =====           The Company  recorded a 17% increase in net telephone  service revenues to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.           Net measured service and subscription  revenues  increased 18% to $39.1 million for the year ended  December  31,  1999 from $33.1  million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Measured service revenues increased 9% to $35.2 million in 1999 from $32.2 million in 1998 while  subscription  revenues increased 2% to $10.9  million in 1999 from $10.7 million in 1998.  These  increases in call and subscription  fee  revenues  are the result of a 7% increase  in average  access lines in service from  approximately  178,000 lines for the year ended  December 31, 1998 to  approximately  190,000 lines for the year ended  December 31, 1999. The growth in access lines is not fully reflected in increased  measured service revenues  as newer  customers  require a period  of  maturity  before  producing revenues similar to established telephone customers.           These  revenues  have been  offset by net  interconnect  charges  which totaled  $7.0  million for the year ended  December 31, 1999 as compared to $9.8 million  for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  As a  percentage  of call and subscription  revenues,  net interconnect charges have declined from 23% for the year ended December 31, 1998 to 15% for the year ended December 31, 1999, due to a higher  proportion of local  traffic as additional  access lines are placed in service plus a negotiated  reduction in interconnect  fees effective  January 1, 1999. Based upon recent  negotiations  with Matav and the Hungarian  Ministry of Telecommunications,  the Company  expects net  interconnect,  as a percentage of call and subscription revenues, to remain consistent with 1999 levels in 2000.           Connection  fees for the year ended  December  31,  1999  totaled  $1.8 million as  compared  to $2.0  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1998. Connection  fees increased in functional  currency terms by 5% due to additional access lines being  connected in 1999 as compared to 1998.  However,  due to the devaluation of the Hungarian  forint during the period,  connection fees for the year have remained relatively consistent in U.S dollar terms with 1998 amounts.                                         -33-             Other operating  revenues increased 25% to $4.5 million during the year ended  December 31, 1999 compared to $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 1998 due to revenues  generated from the provision of direct lines and other miscellaneous telephony service revenues.       Operating and Maintenance Expenses           Operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 decreased to $17.5 million compared to $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. On a per line basis,  operating and maintenance  expenses decreased to approximately  $92 per average  access line for the year ended December 31, 1999 from  $110  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1998 as the  Company  achieved productivity   improvements  and  increased  its  focus  on  reducing  operating expenses,  particularly  through reductions in the number of expatriates working for the Company. The Company does not expect significant  decreases in operating and maintenance  expenses in 2000. However,  on a per line basis,  operating and maintenance  costs are expected to decline as additional  access lines are added during 2000.       Depreciation and Amortization           Depreciation  and amortization  charges  increased to $11.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 1999 from $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Depreciation and amortization charges increased in functional currency terms by approximately 13% due to additional capital expenditures.  However, due to the devaluation of the Hungarian  forint during the period,  depreciation and amortization charges for the year ended 1999 have remained relatively consistent in U.S.  dollar terms with 1998 amounts.  The Company expects  depreciation  and amortization  charges in 2000 to increase in  functional  currency  terms due to additional capital expenditures in its operating subsidiaries,  however, in U.S. dollar  terms  the  Company  expects  depreciation  and  amortization  to remain consistent  with 1999 amounts due to devaluation of the operating  subsidiaries' functional currency.       Management Fees           There was no  management  fee expense for the year ended  December  31, 1999 as compared to $2.5  million for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  This decrease is due to the termination of management  services agreement between the Company and Citizens  International  Management Services Company. See Note 15 of Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  Company  does not have any continuing management services agreements.       Cost of Termination of Management Services Agreement           For the year ended  December  31, 1998,  the Company  recorded a charge totaling  $11.1  million  representing  the  present  value of  payments  due to Citizens  International  Management  Services  Company under a  termination  and consulting agreement. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                        -34-        Income (Loss) from Operations           Income from  operations  was $16.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1999  compared to a loss from  operations of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.  Adjusted for the cost of terminating the management services agreement  and  management  fees,  income  from  operations  for the year  ended December 31, 1998 amounted to $7.6 million.  Contributing  to such  improvements were higher  revenues  and lower  operating  and  maintenance  expenses  and the elimination  of the  management  fees  described  above  during  the year  ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December  31,  1998,  offset by increased depreciation and amortization charges during the year.       Foreign Exchange Losses           Foreign  exchange losses increased $2.6 million to $2.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 1999 from $0.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998. Such foreign  exchange  losses resulted  primarily from the devaluation of the Hungarian forint against the U.S. dollar during the period. This increase in foreign exchange losses during the period is due to the Company's  restructuring of its debt obligations in May 1999. Prior to its  restructuring the Company had debt  denominated  in Hungarian  forints.  The Company now has debt  obligations denominated  in U.S.  dollars  and  euros,  as well as  Hungarian  forints.  See "Liquidity and Capital  Resources"  section below for information  regarding the Company's  debt  restructuring  during the period.  See also the  "Inflation and Foreign Currency" and "Market Risk Exposure" sections below.       Interest Expense           Interest expense decreased to $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.  This decrease was attributable to lower average debt levels during the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1998.  This reduction in average debt levels outstanding during the period is due to the Company's  restructuring of its debt  obligations  in May 1999. The decrease also reflects lower interest rates  paid on  borrowings  in U.S.  dollars  and euros  compared  to  Hungarian forints.       Interest Income           Interest  income  increased to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily due to higher average cash balances outstanding during the period.       Other, net           Other, expense amounted to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to other income of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This decrease is due to an approximate  $0.8 million gain realized related to the  termination  of the former  management  services  agreement  between the Company and Citizens International  Management Services Company during 1998. The Company does not have any continuing management services agreements. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       Loss Before Extraordinary Items           As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company recorded a loss before  extraordinary  items of $17.8 million,  or $1.85 per share, for the year ended  December  31, 1999 as compared  to a loss before  extraordinary  items of $50.6 million, or $9.53 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1998.                                        -35-         Extraordinary Items, net           For  the  year  ended  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  recorded  an extraordinary  item of $20.9 million comprised of extraordinary  income of $27.1 million  which  consists  of a  $9.0  million  gain  on  extinguishment  of  the liabilities  the  Company  had  with  Citizens  and  a  $18.1  million  gain  on extinguishment of all amounts due under a contractor financing facility,  offset in part by a  non-cash  charge of $6.2  million  related  to the  write-off  the remaining  unamortized  deferred  financing costs and credits  pertaining to the Original Postabank Credit Facility.         Net Income (Loss)           As a result of the factors  discussed  above,  the Company recorded net income of $3.2 million,  or $0.33 per share for the year ended December 31, 1999 as  compared to a net loss of $50.6  million,  or ($9.53) per share for the year ended December 31, 1998.

Net measured service and subscription  revenues  increased 43% to $33.1 million for the year ended  December  31,  1998 from $23.2  million for the year ended  December 31,  1997.  Measured  service  revenues  increased  23% to $32.2 million in 1998 from $26.2 million in 1997 while subscription revenues increased 49% to $10.7 million in 1998 from $7.2 million in 1997.  These increases in call and subscription fee revenues are the result of a 35% increase in average access lines in service from  approximately  132,000 lines for the year ended  December 31, 1997 to  approximately  178,000 lines for the year ended  December 31, 1998. The growth in access lines is not fully reflected in increased  measured service revenues  as newer  customers  require a period  of  maturity  before  producing revenues similar to established telephone customers.                                        -36-            These  revenues  have been  offset by net  interconnect  charges  which totaled $9.8  million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to $10.2 million  for the year ended  December  31,  1997.  As a  percentage  of call and subscription  revenues,  net interconnect charges have declined from 31% for the year ended December 31, 1997 to 23% for the year ended December 31, 1998, due to a higher  proportion of local  traffic as additional  access lines are placed in service plus a negotiated  reduction in interconnect  fees effective  January 1, 1998.           Connection  fees for the year ended  December  31,  1998  totaled  $2.0 million as compared to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  This decrease reflects the reduction in the number of new access lines connected from approximately  81,700 during the year ended  December 31, 1997 to  approximately 9,900  lines  during the year ended  December  31,  1998.  Connection  fees were expected to decline substantially during the year as the majority of wait-listed customers have been provided with access lines.  The Company expects  connection fees to continue to decline as no significant  backlog of wait-listed  customers exists.           Other operating revenues increased 100% to $3.6 million during the year ended  December 31, 1998 compared to $1.8 million during the year ended December 31,  1997 due to  revenues  generated  from the  provision  of direct  lines and revenues generated from Lucent PBX sales and related maintenance services.       Operating and Maintenance Expenses           Operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 1998 decreased to $19.6 million compared to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. On a per line basis,  operating and maintenance  expenses decreased to approximately  $110 per average access line for the year ended December 31, 1998 from  $190  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1997 as the  Company  achieved productivity  improvements,  including  discontinuing the use of labor intensive manual switchboards through the use of modern switching  technology,  as well as increased focus on reducing operating expenses.       Termination of Management Services Agreement           For the year ended  December  31, 1998,  the Company  recorded a charge totaling  $11.1  million  representing  the  present  value of  payments  due to Citizens  International  Management  Services  Company under a  termination  and consulting agreement. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       Depreciation and Amortization           Depreciation  and amortization  charges  increased to $11.6 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 from $8.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997.       Management Fees           Management fees pursuant to management service agreements  decreased to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  This decrease was due to the termination of management services  agreement  between the Company and Citizens  International  Management Services Company. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not have any continuing management services agreement.                                        -37-        Loss from Operations           Loss from  operations  increased  to $6.1  million  for the year  ended December 31, 1998 compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Excluding  the  cost  of  terminating  the  management  services  agreement  and management  fees,  income from  operations for the years ended December 31, 1998 and  1997  would  have  been  $7.6  million  and  $4.5  million,   respectively. Contributing to such  improvements  were higher revenues and lower operating and maintenance  expenses during the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997, offset by increased  depreciation and amortization charges during the year       Foreign Exchange Loss           Foreign  exchange  losses  decreased to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $0.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  Such foreign  exchange losses  resulted from the devaluation of the Hungarian  forint against the U.S. dollar and the German Mark.       Interest Expense           Interest expense increased to $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  This increase was  attributable  to higher  average debt levels during the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 as the Company incurred additional   indebtedness   in  order  to  continue  the   construction  of  its telecommunications   networks  and  repay  other  loan   obligations.   Interest capitalized and included in the cost of construction of certain long term assets amounted to approximately $0.3 million during 1998 and $4.5 million in 1997.       Other, net           Other,  net income amounted to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31,  1998 as  compared to $13,000 for the year ended  December  31,  1997.  This increase  during the year ended December 31, 1998 is due to an approximate  $0.8 million  gain  realized  related to the  termination  of the  former  management services  agreement  between the Company and Citizens  International  Management Services Company.  Under such termination  agreement,  the Company satisfied its obligations,  under a previous management services agreement, of $9.6 million by issuing  100,000 shares of Common Stock valued at $513,000 and a promissory note in the amount of $8.4 million.  See Note 15 of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial Statements.       Net Loss           As a result of the factors  discussed above, the Company recorded a net loss of $50.6 million,  or $9.53 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared  to a net loss of $36.2  million,  or $7.97 per share,  for the year ended December 31, 1997.                                         -38-    Liquidity and Capital Resources           The Company has historically funded its capital requirements  primarily through  a  combination  of debt,  equity  and  vendor  financing.  The  ongoing development and  installation of the network in each of the Company's  Operating Areas  required  significant  capital  expenditures  ($181 million at historical exchange rates through December 31, 1999).  The Company's  networks now have the capacity to provide basic  telephone  services to virtually all of the potential subscribers within its Operating Areas.           On October 15, 1996,  the Company  entered into a $170 million  10-year Multi-Currency  Credit Facility with Postabank (the "Original  Postabank  Credit Facility").  Proceeds from the Original Postabank Credit Facility could be drawn entirely in Hungarian  forints and up to 20% of the principal  could be drawn in U.S.  dollars  through  March 31,  1999.  Drawdowns  in  Hungarian  forints bore interest  at a rate  of  2.5%  above  the  average  of the  yield  on  six-  and twelve-month discounted Hungarian treasury bills while drawdowns in U.S. dollars bore interest at 2.5% above LIBOR. Interest for the first two years was deferred at the Company's option. Amounts outstanding in Hungarian forints, including any deferred interest,  were payable in 32 equal quarterly installments beginning on March 31, 1999.           In October 1996,  the Company  borrowed the equivalent of $82.3 million in Hungarian forints under the Original Postabank Credit Facility. Approximately $75.2  million of this  amount  was used to repay  Citicorp  all funds  advanced pursuant to a $75.0 million  secured term loan credit  facility  entered into in March  1996,  and $2.0  million  in fees and costs  representing  settlement  in connection with the cancellation of the Company's  proposed private placement of debt securities.  The remaining $5.1 million was used to pay management fees and reimbursable  costs  owed  to  Citizens  pursuant  to  the  Management  Services Agreement with Citizens.  An additional $5.6 million of the facility was used to pay loan  origination  fees and costs to  Postabank  under the terms of the loan agreement, $2 million of which were reimbursed to the Company in equal quarterly installments  over a two year period,  and was being  amortized over the life of the  loan  facility.  The  remainder  of the  proceeds  were  used  to  complete construction of the Company's  telecommunication  networks,  provide  additional working capital,  and refinance or repay other existing debt obligations.  As of December  31, 1998,  the Company had borrowed the entire $170 million  under the Postabank Credit Facility.           On May 12, 1999, the Company entered into various agreements as part of a revision of its capital  structure with the following  parties:  Postabank Rt. ("Postabank"); Tele Danmark A/S ("Tele Danmark"); the Danish Investment Fund for Central and Eastern  Europe (the "Danish  Fund");  CU  CapitalCorp  and Citizens International  Management  Services  Company,  each of which  is a  wholly-owned subsidiary of Citizens  Utilities  Company  (Citizens  Utilities Company and its subsidiaries  are hereinafter  referred to as  "Citizens").  As a result of such agreements,  the Company  extinguished  all of its  obligations (i) to Postabank under the Original Postabank Credit Facility in the amount of approximately $193 million  and the amounts  borrowed  to settle a portion  due under a  contractor financing  facility in the amount of approximately  $16 million;  (ii) to one of its  contractors  under  a  contractor  financing  facility  in  the  amount  of approximately $35 million; and (iii) to Citizens under a $8.4 million promissory note which was payable in 2004 and an  obligation to pay Citizens $21 million in 28 quarterly installments of $750,000 each from 2004 through and including 2010. The  effect  of these  transactions  has  been a  significant  reduction  in the financial  obligations  of the Company.  The Company has borrowed from Postabank $138 million  ($134  million at current  exchange  rates) under a one-year  dual                                        -39-    currency  bridge loan  agreement in Hungarian  forints and euros and $25 million pursuant to certain  unsecured  notes which mature in 2007.  Some of the various agreements which were entered into as of May 12, 1999 are described herein. (The descriptions and summaries herein do not purport to be complete, and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, reference to each such agreement, copies of which are filed as Exhibits hereto).           The Company and  Postabank  entered  into a Dual  Currency  Bridge Loan Agreement  (the  "Postabank  Bridge Loan  Agreement")  pursuant to which  HTCC's subsidiaries  borrowed the  equivalent of $111 million in Hungarian  forints and $27 million in euros which funds were  applied to the  repayment of the Original Postabank  Credit  Facility.  The loan is  repayable  on May 10,  2000 and bears interest  at an initial  rate of 2.25% (the  "Margin")  plus the  Budapest  Bank Offering  Rate  or Euro  LIBOR  Rate  (currently  approximately  15%  and  2.5%, respectively)  which  Margin  increases  incrementally  to 4.25%,  in  quarterly increments  of 1% over the next  year.  HTCC and one of its  subsidiaries,  HTCC Consulting  Rt. are  guarantors  for the HTCC  subsidiaries  under the Postabank Bridge  Loan  Agreement.  The Company  has  pledged  all of its  intangible  and tangible assets,  including HTCC's ownership interests in its subsidiaries,  and its real property to secure all of the  obligations  under the Postabank  Bridge Loan  Agreement.  The Company entered into a series of agreements to secure such obligations under the Postabank Bridge Loan Agreement.           The Company and  Postabank  also  entered  into a  Securities  Purchase Agreement (the  "Securities  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant to which  Postabank purchased  2,428,572  shares of the  Company's  common  stock  for an  aggregate purchase price of $34 million.  The Securities  Purchase  Agreement provides for one person designated by Postabank to be nominated for election to the Company's Board of Directors.  Postabank  cannot  transfer its shares until the earlier of (x) the repayment in full of all the obligations under the Postabank Bridge Loan Agreement or (y) May 10, 2000,  and then Postabank can only transfer such shares incrementally  through 2003 subject to the Company's right of first refusal. The Company's  right of first  refusal  expires in January 2003 and is assignable by the  Company  to any  beneficial  holder  of  more  than  10%  of the  Company's outstanding  common  stock.  The  Company  applied the  proceeds  from the stock issuance to the repayment of the Original Postabank Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase  Agreement,  the Company issued notes to Postabank in an aggregate  amount of $25 million (the  "Notes")  with  detachable  warrants (the "Warrants").  The Notes accrue interest, which is payable semi-annually,  at the LIBOR rate applicable for the six month interest  period,  plus 4%. On April 11, 2000,  the Notes were amended  such that the interest  rate was changed to LIBOR plus 3.5%. The Notes which mature in 2007 are transferable subject to applicable security laws.  The Warrants  which were issued  pursuant to a series of Warrant Agreements  between the  Company  and  Postabank  enable  Postabank  to purchase 2,500,000  shares of the Company's  common stock at an exercise price of $10 per share.  The exercise period commences on January 1, 2004 and terminates on March 31,  2007.  The  Company  has the right to  terminate  the  Warrants  in full or proportionately  prior to January 1, 2004  provided  that the  Company  repays a proportionate amount of the Notes and an amount equal to 7-1/2% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repaid,  concurrently  with the termination of the Warrants.           The Company and Tele Danmark  entered into a Stock  Purchase  Agreement (the "TD  Stock  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant  to which  the  Company  issued 1,571,429  shares of Common  Stock in  exchange  for $11  million.  The  Company applied the proceeds  from the TD Stock  Purchase  Agreement to the repayment of the Original Postabank Credit Facility.  Tele Danmark agreed not to transfer the shares to any party prior to May 11, 2000 without the prior  written  consent of the Company.                                        -40-             The Company and the Danish Fund entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  "Danish  Fund Stock  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant  to which the Company issued 1,285,714 shares of Common Stock in exchange for $9 million.  The Company applied  the  proceeds  from the Danish  Fund Stock  Purchase  Agreement  to the repayment of the Original Postabank Credit Facility.  The Danish Fund agreed not to transfer  the shares to any party  except for Tele  Danmark  prior to May 11, 2000 without the prior written consent of the Company.           The Company and Citizens  entered into a Stock Purchase  Agreement (the "Citizens  Stock  Purchase  Agreement')  pursuant to which the Company issued to Citizens  1,300,000  shares of Common Stock and 30,000  shares of the  Company's Series  A  Preferred  Stock,  par  value  $0.01  (the  "Preferred  Shares").  In consideration  for such  shares,  Citizens  (i)  transferred  to the Company for cancellation  a $8.4 million  promissory  note issued by the Company to Citizens which was to mature in 2004, (ii) agreed to forego half of the accrued  interest due on the promissory note through May 15, 1999 and (iii) agreed to renounce and forego any rights whatsoever to any payment of the $21 million which was payable by the Company to  Citizens  in  quarterly  installments  of $750,000  from 2004 through and including 2010. Citizens,  as the holder of the Preferred Shares, is entitled  to  receive  cumulative  cash  dividends  at an  annual  rate  of  5%, compounded  annually on the liquidation  value of $70 per share. The Company may redeem  the  Preferred  Shares at any time.  Citizens  can  convert  each of the Preferred  Shares into  shares of the  Company's  common  stock on a one for ten basis.  The  Citizens  Stock  Purchase  Agreement  provided  that if the average closing  price of the  Company's  common  stock for the twenty (20) trading days ending  March 31, 2000 is less than $7.00 per share,  then HTCC shall issue such number of HTCC  Preferred  Shares (with a value of $70 per share) equal in value to (i) 1,600,000  times (ii) $7.00 less the average closing price of HTCC common stock for such twenty (20) trading day period.  The average closing price of the Company's  common stock for the above  mentioned  period was more than $7.00 per share and as a result,  no additional  shares of HTCC preferred  stock have been issued to Citizens. The Citizens Stock Purchase Agreement also requires Citizens not to transfer  any shares of HTCC common  stock which it may hold prior to May 15,  2000  without  the prior  written  consent of the  Company  and  Postabank. Citizens  also  waived  any and  all  preemptive  and  anti-dilution  rights  in connection  with the  transactions  described  above.  As a result  of the Stock Purchase Agreement with Citizens,  the Company recorded  extraordinary income of $9.0 million during the second quarter of 1999 which represented the gain on the extinguishment of the liabilities the Company had with Citizens.           During 1996 and 1997,  the Company  entered into  several  construction contracts  with a  Hungarian  contractor  which  totalled  $59.0  million in the aggregate,  $47.5  million  of which  was  financed  by a  contractor  financing facility.  The  contractor  financed the financing  facility  through a facility provided by  Postabank.  As of December  31,  1998,  the balance  owed under the contractor  financing facility was $36.6 million.  On March 30, 1999,  Postabank assumed HUF 7 billion  plus accrued  interest of HUF 348 million  (approximately $30.9  million)  of the  Company's  liability  under  the  contractor  financing facility from the contractor,  due to the contractor's  financial  difficulties, and sold this debt back to the  Company for HUF 3 billion  (approximately  $12.6 million).  The purchase of the debt was financed by Postabank.  On the same day, the Company purchased HUF 4 billion  (approximately  $16.8 million) of loans the contractor had with Postabank for HUF 900 million  (approximately  $3.8 million) and  subsequently  offset the  booked  value of the loans  purchased  of HUF 900 million (approximately $3.8 million) against the outstanding amounts owed to the contractor.  The purchase of these loans was also  financed by  Postabank.  As a result of the above transactions,  the Company recorded an extraordinary gain of HUF 4.3 billion  (approximately $18.1 million) during the second quarter of 1999 which  reflects  the  extinguishment  of all  amounts  due under the  contractor financing facility.                                         -41-            As a result of the agreements  above, the Company had 11,981,579 shares of common stock  outstanding as of December 31, 1999. The following parties hold the following  percentages of such shares:  Postabank 20.3%; Tele Danmark 21.4%; the Danish Fund 10.7%;  Citizens  19.2%;  and others 28.4%.  On a  fully-diluted basis, the Company had 20,218,638 shares outstanding. The following parties hold the following  percentages of such shares:  Postabank 24.4%; Tele Danmark 12.7%; the Danish Fund 6.4%; Citizens 35.2%; and others 21.3%.           On April 11, 2000,  the Company  entered into a EUR 130 million  Senior Secured Debt Facility  Agreement (the "Debt  Agreement") with a European banking syndicate.  The Company  intends to draw down the entire EUR 130  million  ($124 million at current exchange rates),  which funds will be used in their entirety, along with  another $6 million  of other  Company  funds,  to pay off the entire outstanding balance EUR 128 million  (approximately $128 million at December 31, 1999 exchange rates) of the Postabank Bridge Loan Agreement which will result in the  termination of the Postabank  Bridge Loan which matures on May 12, 2000, as well as fees associated  with the Debt  Agreement.  The borrowers under the Debt Agreement are the Operating Companies who were the borrowers under the Postabank Bridge Loan Agreement.           The Debt  Agreement has two  facilities.  Facility A is a floating rate term loan in the amount of EUR 125 million (the "Term Facility") which principal is repayable semi-annually on each June 30 and December 31 beginning on June 30, 2001 and ending on December 31, 2007. The amount of the principal  repayments on the Term Facility are to be an  escalating  percentage of the amounts drawn down (EUR 125 million). Any amounts borrowed under the Term Facility have to be drawn down within thirty days of the  execution of the Debt  Agreement in either euros or, if funded by the banking syndicate,  Hungarian forints.  The Company intends to borrow the full EUR 125 million,  or its  equivalent  in euros and  Hungarian forints.  Any amounts  borrowed in Hungarian  forints are repayable in Hungarian forints.  The Term Facility loans  denominated  in euros accrue  interest at the rate of the  Applicable  Margin  (defined  below) plus the EURIBOR  rate for the applicable  interest  period.  The EURIBOR rate is the percentage rate per annum determined by the Banking  Federation of the European  Union for the  applicable interest period. The Term Facility loans denominated in Hungarian forints accrue interest at the rate of the  Applicable  Margin  (defined  below) plus the BUBOR rate for the applicable  interest period.  The BUBOR rate is the percentage rate per annum determined  according to the rules  established by the Hungarian Forex Association  and  published by the National  Bank of Hungary for the  applicable interest  period.  The  applicable  interest  period  for  Term  Facility  Loans denominated  in euros is, at the Company's  option in one,  three or six months. The Company  intends to choose six months.  The applicable  interest  period for Term Facility Loans denominated in Hungarian forints is, at the Company's option in one or three months. The Company intends to choose three months.  Interest is payable at the end of each interest period.  The Applicable  Margin is initially 1.75%. The Applicable Margin may be adjusted downward incrementally to a minimum of 1.15% subject to the financial  performance of the Company as measured by the ratio of the  Company's  senior debt to its  earnings  before  interest,  taxes, depreciation and amortization.                                        -42-            Facility B is a  floating  rate  revolving  loan in the amount of EUR 5 million (the "Revolving  Facility")  which can only be drawn down in euros.  The Revolving  Facility will be reduced to EUR 2.5 million on December 31, 2005. The Revolving  Facility is available until December 31, 2007. The Company intends to borrow the full amount of the  Revolving  Facility to pay off the balance of the Postabank  Bridge Loan Agreement and fees associated with the  transaction.  The principal amount borrowed under the Revolving Facility is due at the end of each interest period at which point the Company can,  subject to certain  conditions, roll over the amount of principal  borrowed.  The applicable interest period for the Revolving  Facility is, at the Company's option,  one, three, or six months. The Company intends to choose six months. Interest is payable at the end of each interest  period  calculated  similar to Term  Facility A loans  denominated  in euros.           As a part of the Debt  Agreement,  the  Company is required to hedge at least 50% of the euro  borrowings  until a minimum of 50% of Facility A has been cancelled,  prepaid or repaid.  Dependent on its cash flow,  commencing in 2001, the Company will be required to prepay the equivalent of $25 million on Facility A until such time as $25 million has been prepaid.  The amount of the prepayment in any year shall be at least 50% of the Company's excess cash flow, if any, for the previous  financial  year as defined in the Debt  Agreement.  The prepayment amount is due within 15 days of the publication of each annual Form 10-K filing.           The Company is obligated to pay a commitment  fee equal to the lower of 0.75% or 50% of the Applicable Margin on any available unused commitment.  Since the Company intends to borrow the full amount of the Debt Agreement soon,  there will be no commitment  fee payable at the present time.  The Company will pay an arrangement fee in the amount of EUR 2,665,000 (approximately $2,500,000) and an agency  fee in the amount of  $60,000.  HTCC and one of its  subsidiaries,  HTCC Consulting  Rt., are guarantors for the HTCC  operating  subsidiaries  under the Debt  Agreement.  The Company has pledged  all of its  intangible  and  tangible assets,  including HTCC's ownership interests in its subsidiaries,  and its real property to secure all of the obligations under the Debt Agreement.  The Company and Citibank  Rt.(as  security  agent)  entered into a series of  agreements  to secure  all of the  Company's  obligations  under the Debt  Agreement.  The Debt Agreement  contains  customary  representation  and  warranties.  The Company is subject to some  restrictive  covenants  including  restrictions  regarding  the ability of the Company to pay dividends,  borrow funds, merge and dispose of its assets. The Debt Agreement contains the customary events of default, which would trigger early  repayment of the balance on the Debt  Agreement  including  those related to a change of control.  If prior to the later of the  December 31, 2001 or the Trigger Date (as defined below),  Tele Danmark sells any of the shares of Common  Stock  that it  currently  owns or Tele  Danmark  and the  Danish  Fund, together,  no longer own 30.1% of the outstanding Common Stock, then an event of default  shall have  occurred.  Tele Danmark and the Danish Fund  currently  own 32.1% of the outstanding  Common Stock.  The Trigger Date is defined as the date on which for the prior two fiscal quarters the Company's debt to EBITDA ratio is less than 3.5 to 1.  Following the Trigger Date,  Tele Danmark can only transfer its shares with the prior written consent of banks holding at least 66.7% of the Company's outstanding debt under the Debt Facility.           In 1995, the Company  applied for network  construction  subsidies from the  Hungarian   government.   In  December  1995,   certain  of  the  Company's applications were approved, subject to certain conditions, which resulted in the Company being awarded subsidies  aggregating $0.9 million.  The Company received such  subsidies  in  installments  in the  fourth  quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997. One-half of such funds were received in the form of a grant and one-half in the form of a non-interest  bearing loan repayable over a three year period beginning in 1997.                                        -43-            Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $18.5 million for the year ended  December  31,  1999  compared  to $11.1  million  for the year ended December 31, 1998.  For the years ended  December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company used $9.9 million and $15.6  million,  respectively,  in  investing  activities, which  was   primarily   used  to  fund  the   construction   of  the  Company's telecommunications  networks.  Financing  activities  provided  net cash of $1.0 million  and $9.3  million  for the  years  ended  December  31,  1999 and 1998, respectively.  Inflation and Foreign Currency           For the  year  ended  December  31,  1999,  inflation  in  Hungary  was approximately  10% on an annualized  basis.  It is the stated policy goal of the Hungarian government to keep inflation from exceeding  approximately 7% in 2000. Due to the  strengthening of the U.S. dollar on  international  currency markets during the year,  the Hungarian  forint/U.S.  dollar  exchange rate increased to 252.52 as of December 31, 1999, an effective devaluation during 1999 of 14.3%.           The  Company's  Hungarian  operations  generate  revenues in  Hungarian forints and incur operating and other expenses,  including capital expenditures, predominately  in  Hungarian  forints but also in U.S.  dollars.  The  Company's resulting foreign currency exposure is difficult to hedge due to the significant costs involved and the lack of a market for such hedging.  In addition,  certain of the  Company's  balance sheet  accounts are  expressed in foreign  currencies other than the Hungarian forint, the Company's Hungarian subsidiaries functional currency.  Accordingly, when such accounts are converted into Hungarian forints, the Company is subject to foreign  exchange gains and losses which are reflected as a  component  of  net  income  or  loss.  When  the  Company's  subsidiaries' forint-denominated  accounts  are  translated  into U.S.  dollars for  financial reporting  purposes,  the  Company is subject to  translation  adjustments,  the effect of which is reflected as a component of stockholders' deficiency.           While the Company has the ability to increase the prices it charges for its services  commensurate with increases in the Hungarian  Consumer Price Index ("CPI")  pursuant to its licenses from the Hungarian  government,  it may choose not to implement the full amount of the increase  permitted  due to  competitive and other concerns.  In addition,  the rate of increase in the Hungarian CPI may be less than the rate at which the Hungarian forint devalues.  As a result,  the Company may be unable to generate cash flows to the degree necessary to meet its obligation in currencies other than the Hungarian forint.  Year 2000           The Company  initiated a project designed to identify and mitigate Year 2000 computer  deficiencies  in 1998.  The Company formed a Year 2K project team consisting of Company  employees and  representatives  of systems  vendors.  The Company also formed an oversight  committee  comprised of senior  management  to oversee the Y2K issue.           The Company originally estimated the total costs of remediation,  which included  the  replacement   and/or  upgrade  of  certain   equipment  would  be approximately  $785,000.  However,  due to  agreements  with its switch  vendors during 1999, the Company was able to obtain Y2K switching  upgrades for no cost. For the year  ended  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  expensed  approximately $162,000 for remediation of the Y2K problem,  which is included in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations.                                        -44-             From December 31, 1999, to March 15, 2000,  the Company  operated a Y2K information  center to monitor  the  Company's  facilities  and  operations.  No material problems were reported in any of the Company's facilities or operations during  this  period.  As of the  date  of  this  filing,  the  Company  had not experienced any material Year 2000 problems with its IT or non-IT  systems,  nor had the Company  experienced any material problems with any of its key customers or suppliers.  The Company will continue to monitor its systems for possible Y2K related problems,  but based on its experience since December 31, 1999, does not expect that any material Y2K problems will emerge.  Prospective Accounting Pronouncements           In June 1998,  Statement of Financial  Account Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"),  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities",  was issued.  SFAS 133 established  accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging  activities.  SFAS requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value.  The Statement,  as amended by SFAS 137, is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  The Company has not purchased  derivative  instruments or entered into hedging activities during the three years ended  December 31, 1999. The Company will be required to enter into hedging  transactions  under the terms of the Company's  EUR 130 million  Senior Secured Debt Facility,  which was entered into on April 11, 2000. The Company is currently  evaluating  the effect,  if any, the  pronouncement  will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.  Market Risk Exposure           The Company is exposed to various types of risk in the normal course of its  business,   including  the  impact  of  foreign   currency   exchange  rate fluctuations  and interest  rate  changes.  Company  operations,  including  all revenues and  approximately  75% of operational costs are Hungarian forint based and are  therefore  subject to exchange rate  variability  between the Hungarian forint and U.S.  dollar.  This  variability  is  mitigated  by several  factors, including  the Hungarian  National Bank policy to peg the Hungarian  forint to a currency  basket and the  telecommunications  pricing  law. The  "crawling  peg" policy of the National Bank of Hungary  maintained a scheduled daily devaluation of the Hungarian  forint through a currency  basket  consisting of 70% euros and 30% U.S.  dollars for 1999.  Effective  January 1, 2000, the Hungarian forint is pegged 100% to the Euro.  The Hungarian  forint is allowed to trade within 2.25% of the  mid-point  of its  trading  band.  For the first  quarter  of 2000,  the Hungarian government devaluation policy was 0.4% per month. As of April 1, 2000, the Hungarian  government  announced the monthly  planned  devaluation  rate was decreased to 0.3% per month for the Hungarian forint, which totals approximately 3.9% for 2000. The  telecommunications  pricing law allows prices to increase by the Consumer  Price Index (CPI)  adjusted for an efficiency  factor of up to 2%. Thus, to the extent that adjusted CPI follows devaluation, revenues are somewhat insulated from exchange rate risk.           The debt obligations of the Company are Hungarian forint, euro and U.S. dollar  denominated.  The interest rate on the Hungarian forint debt obligations is based on the Budapest Interbank Offer Rate (BUBOR). The interest rates on the euro and U.S. dollar denominated obligations are based on LIBOR. Over the medium to long term,  the BUBOR rate is expected to follow  inflation  and  devaluation                                        -45-   trends and the Company does not currently  believe it has any material  interest rate risk on any of its Hungarian forint  denominated debt obligations.  If a 1% change in the BUBOR interest rate were to occur, the Company's  interest expense would  increase  or  decrease  by  approximately  $1.0  million  based  upon the Company's year-end debt level. If a 1% change in the LIBOR interest rate were to occur,   the  Company's   interest   expense  would   increase  or  decrease  by approximately $500,000.           The  Company  is also  exposed to  exchange  rate risk in so far as the Company  has debt  obligations  in other  than the  functional  currency  of its majority owned  Hungarian  subsidiaries.  Given the Company's debt  obligations, which include euro and U.S. dollar denominated debt, if a 1% change in Hungarian forint/euro exchange rates were to occur, the Company's exchange rate risk would increase or  decrease by  approximately  $252,000.  If a 1% change in  Hungarian forint/U.S.  dollar  exchange rates were to occur,  the Company's  exchange rate risk would increase or decrease by approximately $250,000.                 Item 8.
