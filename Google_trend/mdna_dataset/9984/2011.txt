Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        OVERVIEW       2010 Highlights       Both of the Companys business segments continued to be impacted during 2010 by the states of the end-markets served by the Company. In the Logistics and Manufacturing Services segment, the end-markets of the distribution businesses, particularly in North America, showed improvements while the aerospace aftermarket business reflected slight decreases in demand due to a continued trend of deferred maintenance. At Precision Components, the industrial manufacturing businesses were favorably impacted by increased production in the transportation and industrial end-markets while demand in the aerospace original equipment manufacturing business was lower than 2009. As a result, sales increased in both business segments and were up 9.6% to $1,133.2 million Company-wide.       During 2010, operating income was positively impacted by the higher sales volumes, lower cost structures which resulted from actions taken prior to 2010 to restructure the Companys operations, and the absence of restructuring charges. Operating income increased 43.0% from $60.5 million in 2009 to $86.5 million in 2010.        Management continued its focus on cash flow and working capital management in 2010 and generated $65.8 million in cash flow from operations. The Company made higher investments in working capital in 2010, primarily a result of improving business conditions and higher customer demand.        Management Objectives       Management is focused on three areas of development: employees, processes and strategy which, in combination, are expected to generate long-term value for its stockholders. The Companys strategies for growth include both organic growth from new products, services, markets and customers, and growth from acquisitions. The Companys strategies for profitability include lean, productivity and process initiatives, such as production realignment, and efficiency and cost-saving measures as well as portfolio management.       Acquisitions and strategic relationships have been a key growth driver for the Company in both of its business segments. The Company has acquired a number of businesses in the past, the most recent of which was in 2006. The Company continues to evaluate its portfolio management to optimize product line offerings and expand geographic reach, and provide synergistic opportunities. The Company also continues to seek business alliances which foster long-term business relationships.       Our Business    SIZE="1">    Barnes Group consists of two operating segments: Logistics and Manufacturing Services, and Precision Components. In both of these businesses, Barnes Group is among the leaders in the market niches served, and has highly recognized brands for many of the products it sells or manufactures.    SIZE="1">    The Logistics and Manufacturing Services segment provides value-added logistical support and repair services. Value-added logistical support services include inventory management, technical sales, and supply chain solutions for maintenance, repair, operating, and production supplies and services. Repair services provided include the manufacturing of spare parts for the refurbishment and repair of highly engineered components and assemblies for commercial and military aviation.       Precision Components is a global supplier of engineered components for critical applications focused on providing solutions for a diverse industrial, transportation and aerospace customer base. It is equipped to produce virtually every type of precision spring, from fine hairsprings for electronics and instruments to large heavy-duty springs for machinery as well as precision-machined and fabricated components and assemblies for OEM turbine engine, airframe and industrial gas turbine builders throughout the world, and the military. It is a leading         18            manufacturer and supplier of precision mechanical springs, compressor reed valves and nitrogen gas products based in North America and among the worlds largest manufacturers of precision mechanical products and nitrogen gas products. Precision Components also manufactures high-precision punched and fine-blanked components used in transportation and industrial applications, nitrogen gas springs and manifold systems used to precisely control stamping presses, and retention rings that position parts on a shaft or other axis.        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Key Performance Indicators        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the operating profit of the respective businesses, which includes net sales, cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses and certain components of other income and other expenses, as well as the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. Management also uses an internal measurement tool called PPAT, or Performance Profit After Tax. PPAT is an economic value added (EVA ® ) -like metric that calculates operating profit after tax, less a charge for the capital employed by the business. Management utilizes PPAT in economic decision-making, such as capital expenditures, investments in growth initiatives, customer pricing decisions, and evaluation of acquisitions. The goal of utilizing PPAT is to create a mindset among all employees to use capital in the most efficient way possible and to link decisions to stockholder value creation.       In addition to PPAT, which is a measurement tool common in each operating unit, both segments have standard key performance indicators (KPIs), a number of which are focused on customer metrics (customer satisfaction score, on-time-delivery and quality), internal effectiveness and efficiency metrics (sales per employee, scrap and rework, days working capital and controllable expenses), employee-related metrics (total recordable incident rate and lost time incident rate), and unique KPIs on organic growth.       Key Industry Data       In each segment, management also tracks a variety of economic and industry data as indicators of the health of a particular sector.       At Logistics and Manufacturing Services, the distribution business reviews data supplied by the Institute for Supply Managements PMI Composite Index (the PMI) and the Federal Reserves Industrial Production Index (the IPI), which are monthly indicators of the health of U.S. manufacturing activity. Management tracks similar indices in Canada and for the European-based businesses. Management of the aftermarket aerospace operations monitors the number of aircraft in the active fleet, the number of planes temporarily or permanently taken out of service, aircraft utilization rates for the major airlines, engine shop visits, and traffic growth.       At Precision Components, key data for the industrial manufacturing operations include the IPI; the production of light vehicles, both in the U.S. and globally; tooling build schedules; durable goods orders; compressor build forecasts; and global industrial capital expenditures. The aerospace OEM business regularly tracks orders and deliveries for each of the major aircraft manufacturers, as well as engine purchases made for new aircraft. Management also monitors annual appropriations for the U.S. military related to new aircraft purchases and maintenance.

The sales increase reflected $99.3 million of organic sales growth primarily at Precision Components. This increase was slightly offset by the negative impact on sales of foreign currency translation of $0.3 million in 2010 as foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Europe. Geographically, the Companys international sales increased 15.1% year-over-year and domestic sales increased 7.1%.        2009 vs. 2008:       Barnes Group reported net sales of $1,034.2 million in 2009, a decrease of $327.9 million, or 24.1%, from 2008. The sales decrease reflected $309.0 million of organic sales declines, $140.7 million at Logistics and Manufacturing Services and $174.6 million at Precision Components. Additionally, the sale of Spectrum Plastics Molding Resources, Inc. (Spectrum Plastics) in 2008 resulted in a reduction in sales of $1.3 million at Precision Components as compared to 2008. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies as compared to 2008, primarily in Europe and Canada, decreased net sales by $17.6 million in 2009. Geographically, the Companys international sales decreased 28.2% year-over-year while domestic sales decreased 21.5%. The Companys international sales in 2009 decreased 25.1% from 2008 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on sales.       Expenses and Operating Income                                ($ in millions)      2010        2009        $ Change         % Change        2008        Cost of sales      $  724.0         $  671.1         $  52.9             7.9   %      $  847.6         % sales         63.9  %         64.9  %                      62.2  %             Gross profit STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex"> (1)      $  409.2         $  363.0         $  46.1             12.7   %      $  514.5         % sales         36.1  %         35.1  %                      37.8  %             Selling and administrative expenses      $  322.6         $  302.5         $  20.1             6.6   %      $  366.5         % sales         28.5  %         29.3  %                      26.9  %             Operating income      $  86.5         $  60.5         $  26.0             43.0   %      $  147.9         % sales         7.6  %         5.9  %                      10.9  %         (1)  Sales less cost of sales       2010 vs. 2009:       Cost of sales in 2010 increased 7.9% from 2009 primarily as a result of increased sales. The increase in cost of sales was less than the percentage increase in sales and resulted in an improvement in gross profit margin of 1.0 percentage point to 36.1%. Selling and administrative expenses increased 6.6% from 2009 as a result of the increase in sales as well as higher employee related costs, including commissions and employee incentive compensation. Costs of sales and selling and administrative expenses were also impacted by the lower cost structures from previous actions. In 2009, costs of $10.7 million related to the 2009 and 2008 actions taken primarily at Precision Components to restructure its operations were recorded primarily in selling and administrative expenses. See further discussion of the actions below. As a result, operating income in 2010 increased 43.0% from 2009 and operating margin increased from 5.9% to 7.6%.       2009 vs. 2008:       Cost of sales in 2009 decreased 20.8% from 2008 primarily as a result of lower sales. The decrease in cost of sales was less than the percentage decrease in sales and resulted in a reduction in gross profit margin of 2.7 percentage points. Selling and administrative expenses in 2009 decreased 17.5% from 2008. The decreases in        20            cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses resulted primarily from the significantly lower sales volumes in each of the businesses of Logistics and Manufacturing Services and Precision Components and, to a lesser extent, from the benefits of discrete cost reduction actions taken in 2008 and 2009. Additionally, 2009 included costs of $10.7 million, primarily in selling and administrative expense, which related to the 2009 and 2008 actions more fully discussed below. As a result, operating income in 2009 decreased 59.1% from 2008 and operating margin decreased from 10.9% to 5.9%.       During 2009, the Company authorized the restructuring of certain operations of the Precision Components segment by moving the operations of two facilities. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring and related costs of $4.9 million in 2009 which included $2.1 million of employee termination costs, $1.1 million of asset write-downs, $0.5 million of equipment transfer costs, $1.0 million of facility use termination costs and $0.2 million of pension curtailment costs. Also during 2009, the Company implemented other workforce reduction actions at Precision Components and recorded severance expense of $3.4 million. In addition, as a result of actions taken in 2008, the Company recorded additional costs of $2.4 million related to transfer of work and facility exits. These costs are primarily recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in 2009.        During 2008, the Company took a number of actions within each of the businesses primarily in the fourth quarter to reduce overhead costs as the Company aggressively addressed economic conditions, the state of end-markets served and structural complexities within certain geographies. The cost of these discrete actions totaled $19.6 million after-tax in 2008 including $5.4 million included in loss from discontinued operations. The pre-tax charges in 2008 totaled $15.5 million and included $10.9 million of severance and related employee termination costs, a $1.4 million loss on sale of assets related to discontinued businesses and $3.2 million of other costs including contract terminations, asset impairment charges and other associated costs. Of the charges, $0.4 million were recorded in cost of sales, $12.4 million were recorded in selling and administrative expenses and $2.7 million were recorded in discontinued operations. The $4.1 million tax expense includes the valuation and write-off of certain deferred tax assets.        These 2008 and 2009 actions improved the Companys cost structure and its manufacturing footprint and strengthened its global competitive position.       Interest expense       Interest expense in 2010 decreased $2.6 million to $20.0 million from 2009 and decreased $4.0 million to $22.6 million in 2009 from 2008 primarily as a result of lower borrowings.        Other expense (income), net        2010 vs. 2009:       Other expense (income), net in 2010 was $2.5 million compared to $(2.0) million in 2009. The 2009 results included a $3.8 million gain on the repurchase of certain convertible notes. Additionally, foreign currency transaction losses were $1.5 million in 2010 compared to $1.3 million in 2009.       2009 vs. 2008:       Other expense (income), net in 2009 was $(2.0) million compared to $2.3 million in 2008. The 2009 results included the $3.8 million gain on the repurchase of certain convertible notes. The 2008 results included a $1.2 million loss on the sale of Spectrum Plastics. Additionally, foreign currency transaction losses were $1.3 million in 2009 and $0.6 million in 2008.         21           Income Taxes       2010 vs. 2009:       The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations was 16.8% in 2010 compared with 2.4% in 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2009 was primarily driven by the shift in the mix of income to higher-taxing jurisdictions and the impact of the repatriation of a portion of current year foreign earnings to the U.S. During 2010, the Company repatriated a dividend from a portion of current year foreign earnings to the U.S. in the amount of $7.5 million. This dividend increased tax expense by $3.0 million and increased the 2010 annual effective tax rate by 4.7 percentage points.       2009 vs. 2008:       The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations was 2.4% in 2009 compared with 22.1% in 2008. The decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate from 2008 was due primarily to the higher concentration of profits in lower taxing jurisdictions and the absence of profitability in higher tax jurisdictions.       See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the consolidated effective income tax rate. Among other items which could impact the future tax rate is the mix of income between taxing jurisdictions where the Company operates and the repatriation of a portion of future foreign earnings to the U.S.        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In connection with an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for the tax years 2000 through 2002, the IRS proposed adjustments to these tax years of approximately $16.5 million, plus a potential penalty of 20% of the tax assessment plus interest. The adjustment relates to the federal taxation of foreign income of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company filed an administrative protest of these adjustments. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company was informed that its protest was denied and a tax assessment was received from the Appeals Office of the IRS. In November 2009, the Company filed a petition against the IRS in the U.S. Tax Court contesting the tax assessment received. The Company continues to believe its tax position on the issues raised by the IRS is correct and the Company plans to continue to take appropriate actions to vigorously defend its position. The Company believes it will prevail on this issue. Any additional impact on the Companys liability for income taxes cannot presently be determined, but the Company continues to believe it is adequately provided for and the outcome will not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.        Discontinued Operations       In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company exited certain non-core businesses within its Logistics and Manufacturing Services segment in the United Kingdom. These exit activities included the sale of certain assets and transfer of related employees, liquidation of assets, termination of related contracts, and severing of employees. The results of these businesses have been segregated and treated as discontinued operations. In 2008, the $10.1 million loss included a $2.7 million loss related to the exit activities. Of this amount approximately $1.4 million reflected the loss on the sales, approximately $0.6 million were employee-related costs, including severance and other termination benefits, and approximately $0.7 million related to other costs including contract termination charges. In addition, a tax expense of approximately $2.7 million included in discontinued operations related to the valuation and write-off of certain deferred tax assets. The losses are reported net of tax.

The increases were directly attributable to the increase in net income. Basic weighted average shares outstanding in 2010 increased slightly primarily as a result of shares issued for employee stock plans and 1,154,265 shares of treasury stock used to repurchase certain of the Companys convertible notes in August 2009 offset in part by the repurchase of 1,483,527 shares under the Companys publicly announced repurchase program during 2010. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding in 2010 increased as a result of the increase in basic weighted average shares outstanding and the increase in the dilutive effect of potentially issuable shares under the employee stock plans which was driven by an increase in the Companys stock price. The higher dilutive effect in 2008 was primarily the result of the Companys higher stock price which impacted the potentially issuable shares under the employee stock plans and the convertible notes.       Financial Performance by Business Segment       Logistics and Manufacturing Services                               ($ in millions)      2010        2009        $ Change        % Change        2008        Sales      $  548.5         $  539.1         $  9.4            1.7  %      $  691.8         Operating profit         36.9            44.0            (7.0  )         (16.0  )%         79.1         Operating margin         6.7  %         8.2  %                     11.4  %        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> 2010 vs. 2009:        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Logistics and Manufacturing Services recorded sales of $548.5 million in 2010, a 1.7% increase from 2009. The increase was primarily a result of organic sales growth of $10.5 million which resulted largely from end-market improvements in the distribution businesses most significantly in North America. Sales in the aerospace aftermarket business decreased from 2009 and continued to be impacted by lower aircraft utilization and the deferred maintenance trend. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on sales in 2010 of approximately $1.1 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies, primarily in Europe, as compared to 2009.         23           Operating profit at Logistics and Manufacturing Services decreased 16.0% to $36.9 million from 2009 primarily as a result of the profit impact from lower sales from the higher margin aerospace aftermarket business, continued investments to benefit sales force productivity in the distribution businesses, and higher product and employee related costs. Operating profit was favorably impacted by the profit impact of the sales volume increase in the North American distribution businesses as the industrial and transportation end-markets showed improvements from 2009.       Outlook:    SIZE="1">    Organic sales levels in the distribution businesses of the Logistics and Manufacturing Services segment are largely dependent upon the economy in the regions served, the retention of its customers and continuation of existing sales volumes to such customers, and the effectiveness and size of its sales force. Near-term economic conditions remain uncertain and customers continue to manage costs and inventory levels. Management believes future sales growth may result from improvements in economic and end-market conditions, pricing initiatives and investments in market penetration activities and sales force productivity initiatives. Near-term sales levels in the aerospace aftermarket business are expected to continue reflecting recent trends towards improving maintenance, repair and overhaul activity. Management further believes its aerospace aftermarket business is favorably positioned based on strong customer relationships including long-term maintenance and repair contracts in the overhaul and repair business, expected improvement in demand in the aftermarket spare parts business, expanded capabilities and current capacity levels.       Operating profit at Logistics and Manufacturing Services is expected to continue to be affected by the profit impact of the changes in sales volume and mix, and investments made in each of its businesses. Management is committed to actively manage pricing pressures from vendors through cost-sharing initiatives with its customers and increased selling prices. The highly profitable aftermarket RSPs will continue to be impacted by the management fees payable to the customer which generally increase in the fourth or later years of each program. These and other similar fees are deducted from sales and temper sales growth of the aftermarket RSPs and operating margin.        2009 vs. 2008:       The Logistics and Manufacturing Services business segment reported sales of $539.1 million in 2009, a 22.1% decrease from 2008. The lower sales were primarily the result of weak global economic conditions and included a reduction in organic sales in all businesses of $140.7 million. Lower organic sales in 2009 resulted primarily from softness in the distribution business primarily in North America due to weakness in the transportation-related and industrial markets and, to a lesser extent, a reduced distribution sales force compared to 2008. In addition, sales declines in the aerospace aftermarket were driven by lower aircraft utilization, deferred maintenance activities and an increase in the RSP management fees. The negative impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by approximately $12.0 million in 2009 as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies, primarily in Europe and Canada, as compared to 2008.       Operating profit at Logistics and Manufacturing Services in 2009 decreased 44.5% from 2008 to $44.0 million. The decline in operating profit was driven by the profit impact of the lower sales volumes in each of its businesses due to the impact of economic conditions on the end-markets served. Partially offsetting these declines was the positive impact of operational and productivity initiatives, including the lower operating costs resulting from the discrete actions taken in 2008 to address the deteriorating market conditions and geographical complexities, and to align the segments cost structure with its declining sales.        Precision Components                               ($ in millions)      2010        2009        $ Change         % Change        2008        Sales      $  595.9         $  501.5         $  94.4             18.8  %      $  683.0         Operating profit         49.6            16.6            33.0             NM            68.5         Operating margin         8.3  %         3.3  %                      10.0  %         NM   not meaningful         24           2010 vs. 2009:       Sales at Precision Components were $595.9 million in 2010, an increase of 18.8% from 2009. The sales increase resulted primarily from organic sales increases of $93.7 million which resulted mainly from increases in the industrial manufacturing businesses based in North America and Europe and from improvements in the transportation industry, including automotive. Sales in the aerospace OEM business were relatively flat in 2010 compared to 2009. The impact of foreign currency translation increased sales by approximately $0.7 million in 2010.       Operating profit in 2010 at Precision Components was $49.6 million compared to $16.6 million in 2009. Operating profit improvements in 2010 were due primarily to the profit impact of higher sales levels in 2010, lower cost structures resulting from previous actions and lean initiatives. However, these improvements in operating profit were partly offset by costs resulting from higher demand and new product introductions across the businesses including additional costs related to personnel, such as incentive compensation and temporary labor. Additionally, the 2009 results included approximately $10.7 million in restructuring charges primarily for employee termination costs and asset write-downs associated with moving the operations of two facilities.       Outlook:    SIZE="1">    In the industrial manufacturing businesses, management is focused on generating organic sales growth by leveraging the benefits of the diversified products and industrial end-markets in which its businesses have a global presence as well as gaining market share and introducing new products. Sales growth in the global markets served by these businesses is expected to remain uncertain due to economic conditions. However, increased order activity in certain end-markets, including transportation, along with investments made in these businesses during the down cycle may provide incremental benefits in the near-term. Sales in the aerospace OEM business are driven by its commercial engine order backlog through its participation in certain strategic engine programs. Backlog in this business was $346.7 million at December 31, 2010, of which approximately 67% is expected to be shipped in the next 12 months. In the near-term, the aerospace OEM business may be impacted by adjustments of customer inventory levels including insourcing trends, changes in production schedules of specific engine programs, and the general state of the aerospace market driven by the worldwide economy. Management believes that strong long-term aerospace industry fundamentals remain which, together with the pursuit of new programs and increased content levels on certain platforms, are expected to drive future sales growth in this business.        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Operating profit is largely dependant on the sales volumes and mix within all businesses of the segment. Management continues to focus on improving profitability through organic sales growth, pricing initiatives, and productivity and process improvements such as lean. Costs associated with personnel, new product introductions and commodity price increases may negatively impact operating profit.       2009 vs. 2008:       Sales at Precision Components in 2009 were $501.5 million, a 26.6% decrease from 2008. The lower sales levels were primarily the result of weak global economic conditions and included a reduction in organic sales of $174.6 million. The industrial manufacturing businesses in North America and Europe reported significant sales declines due to the global recession and its impact on the transportation industry and, in particular, the automotive sector. Additionally, sales decreased in the aerospace OEM business as customers reduced inventory and lowered production levels. The negative impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by $5.6 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. Spectrum Plastics recorded sales of $1.3 million in 2008, thus the sale of this business in 2008 resulted in a reduction in sales of this amount in 2009.       Operating profit in 2009 at Precision Components was $16.6 million, a decrease of 75.8% from 2008. The decline in operating profits was driven by the impact of the lower sales volumes. Operating profit in 2009 was positively impacted by lower costs resulting from the discrete actions taken in late 2008 to address deteriorating        25            market conditions including personnel reductions and plant consolidations, and initiatives focused on cost savings and cost containment. The favorable impact of these initiatives, however, only partially offset the profit impact of the substantially lower sales levels in 2009 and approximately $10.7 million of costs for actions taken throughout 2009 to address the continued deterioration in the market, including employee termination costs, asset write-downs associated with consolidating certain facilities, and transfer of work costs.        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Management assesses the Companys liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities. Of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditure levels, dividends, capital stock transactions, effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate lines of credit.       The Companys ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths. During 2010, management continued to focus on cash flows and working capital management, and anticipates that operating activities in 2011 will continue to generate adequate cash. The Company closely monitors its cash generation, usage and preservation including the management of working capital to generate cash.       The note holders of the Companys 3.75% Convertible Notes had the option to require the Company to redeem some or all of the Notes on February 1, 2011. As such, the balance of these Notes of $92.4 million ($92.5 million par value) is classified as current in the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2010. If any of the 3.75% Convertible Notes were redeemed on February 1, 2011, the Company intended to finance the redemption through the use of its available credit facilities. However, none of the Notes were redeemed on February 1, 2011 by the note holders. Additionally, the note holders may also require the Company to redeem some or all of the 3.75% Convertible Notes on February 1 st  of 2016 and 2021 and these Notes are subject to redemption at their par value at any time, at the option of the Company on or after February 7, 2011.       The Companys 3.375% Convertible Notes are subject to redemption at their par value at any time, at the option of the Company, on or after March 20, 2014. The note holders may also require the Company to redeem some or all of the 3.375% Convertible Notes on March 15 STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">th  of 2014, 2017 and 2022.       The funded status of the Companys pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and benefit obligations. The funded status of the pension plans improved in 2010 primarily as a result of the increase in the fair value of the Companys pension plan assets due mainly to the gains in the global equity markets. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in the projected benefit obligations of the Companys pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The Company recorded a $5.5 million non-cash after-tax decrease in stockholders equity (through other non-owner changes to equity) to record the current year adjustment for changes in the funded status of its pension and postretirement benefit plans as required under the accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Approximately $11.5 million in contributions were made by the Company to its various pension plans in 2010 which included the required minimum contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plans. The Company expects to contribute approximately $15 million to its various pension plans in 2011.        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Operating cash flow may be supplemented with external borrowings to meet near-term organic business expansion needs and the Companys current financial commitments. The credit markets have presented companies with significant challenges in maintaining or expanding credit facilities. The Company has assessed its credit facilities and currently expects that its bank syndicate, comprised of 15 banks, will continue to support the $400.0 million credit facility which matures in September 2012. At December 31, 2010, the Company has $192.1 million of unused and available borrowings under its $400.0 million credit facility, subject to covenants in the Companys debt agreements. The Company believes its credit facilities, coupled with cash generated from operations, are adequate for its anticipated future requirements.         26           The Company closely monitors compliance with its various debt covenants. The Companys most restrictive financial covenant (the Debt Ratio) requires the Company to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization as defined in the amended and restated revolving credit agreement (Adjusted EBITDA) of not more than 3.75 times at December 31, 2010. The actual ratio at December 31, 2010 was 2.66 times. The Companys debt agreements also contain other financial covenants that require the maintenance of a certain debt ratio (Consolidated Senior Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, of not more than 3.00 times) and a certain interest coverage ratio (Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, of at least 4.50 times) at December 31, 2010. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2010.    SIZE="1">    Any future acquisitions are expected to be financed through internal cash, borrowings and equity, or a combination thereof. Additionally, we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and / or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.       Cash Flow                                ($ in millions)      2010        2009        $ Change        % Change        2008        Operating activities      $  65.8         $  143.5         $  (77.7  )         (54.2  )%      $  111.8         Investing activities         (30.3  )         (26.1  )         (4.2  )         (16.2  )%         (106.7  )      Financing activities         (39.3  )         (121.9  )         82.6            67.8  %         (1.8  )      Exchange rate effect         (0.2  )         1.0            (1.1  )         NM            (3.0  )                                                               Increase (decrease) in cash      $  (4.0  )      $  (3.5  )      $  (0.4  )         (12.6  )%      $  0.4                                                                    NM  Not meaningful        Operating activities are the principal source of cash flow for the Company, generating $65.8 million in cash during 2010 compared to $143.5 million in 2009. Compared to 2009, the lower operating cash flows in 2010 were primarily driven by higher investments in working capital in 2010, specifically in inventory and accounts receivable compared to the significant reductions in 2009. Investments in inventory were necessitated by higher anticipated customer demand while the increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from higher sales levels. Partially offsetting these reductions in operating cash flow, the Company used less cash for long-term retirement benefits in 2010 as compared to 2009, which included an incremental cash contribution of $9.5 million to its qualified pension plans to increase their funded status.        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Investing activities in 2010 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $28.8 million compared to $30.5 million in 2009 as management continued its selectiveness when approving capital expenditures. The Company expects capital expenditures in 2011 to be approximately $40  $50 million. Participation fee payments related to the aftermarket RSPs of $57.5 million were paid in 2008. No payments were required under such agreements in 2010 and 2009. Investing activities in 2008 included the net proceeds of $5.1 million from the sale of Spectrum Plastics.       Cash used in financing activities in 2010 included a net increase in borrowings of $0.7 million compared to a net decrease of $101.8 million in 2009. The cash generated from operations in 2010 was used primarily for capital expenditures, dividends and common stock repurchases. The 2010 activity reflects the repayment of outstanding borrowings under the Wells Fargo credit agreement and the 7.80% Notes primarily with borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. The 2009 change in borrowings included the repurchase of $34.7 million par value of convertible notes at a discounted price of $28.7 million which was funded primarily with borrowings under revolving credit lines. Additionally, in 2009 the higher cash generated from operations and the cash on hand were used for capital expenditures and dividends as well as debt reduction. Total cash used to pay dividends         27            decreased in 2010 by $8.1 million to $17.5 million due to a decrease in the cash dividends per common share from $0.48 in 2009 to $0.32 in 2010. Under the terms of its publicly announced repurchase program, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of the Companys stock at a cost of $28.1 million in 2010 and 2.5 million shares at a cost of $34.2 million in 2008. The Company may from time to time decide to repurchase additional shares under this program. There are a maximum of 1.0 million shares that may be repurchased under the existing program at December 31, 2010.       At December 31, 2010, the Company held $13.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which are held outside the U.S. During 2010, the Company repatriated $7.5 million of current year foreign earnings to the U.S. The balances remain outside the U.S. primarily to fund future international investments.        The Company maintains borrowing facilities with banks to supplement internal cash generation. At December 31, 2010, $207.9 million was borrowed at an average interest rate of 1.01% under the Companys $400.0 million borrowing facility which matures in September, 2012. The Company did not have any borrowings under short-term bank credit lines at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, the Companys total borrowings are comprised of approximately 42% fixed rate debt and approximately 58% variable rate debt. The interest payments on approximately 47% of the variable rate interest debt have been converted into payment of fixed interest plus the borrowing spread under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement described in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.        Debt Covenants       Borrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the Companys debt agreements. The most restrictive borrowing capacity covenant in any agreement requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the amended and restated revolving credit agreement of not more that 3.75 times at December 31, 2010. Following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, to the Companys net income (in millions):                      2010        Net income      $  53.3         Add back:            Interest expense         20.0         Income taxes         10.8         Depreciation and amortization         52.8         Other adjustments         0.2                        Adjusted EBITDA, as defined      $  137.1                        Consolidated Total Debt, as defined      $  365.2         Ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA         2.66          Other adjustments primarily represent losses on the sale of assets. Consolidated Total Debt excludes the debt discount related to the convertible notes. The Companys financial covenants are measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter.

See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       The above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of the potential payments of these amounts cannot be determined. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       OTHER MATTERS       Inflation       Inflation generally affects the Company through its costs of labor, equipment and raw materials. Increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases, operating improvements, and other cost-saving initiatives. The Company has periodically experienced inflation in raw material prices.    SIZE="1">    Critical Accounting Policies       The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results could differ from such estimates.       Inventory Valuation:  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value. Loss provisions, if any, on aerospace contracts are established when estimable. Loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract. The process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the Company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions.         29           Business Acquisitions and Goodwill:  Assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $384.2 million of goodwill, representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value. Management completes their annual impairment assessment during the second quarter of each year.       The assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units. The Company has determined that its reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information reviewed by segment management one level below the operating segment level and which are aggregated when those components have similar economic characteristics. Management estimates the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using the income approach, which reflects managements cash flow projections, and also evaluates the fair value using a market approach. These methodologies used in the current year are consistent with those used in the prior year. Management believes the cash flow projections utilized and/or market multiples are reasonable and consistent with the expectations of market participants. Inherent in managements development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates, including those related to future earnings and growth and the weighted average cost of capital. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods as a result of both Company-specific and overall economic conditions. Future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies, industries and markets in which the Company sells products or services, and the execution of managements plans. There can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.    SIZE="1">    In the second quarter of 2010, management performed its annual impairment testing based on the information available as of the date of the assessment. Based on this assessment, there was no goodwill impairment in 2010 and the fair values of each of the Companys reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values. However, the Companys estimated fair value of its Barnes Distribution reporting unit, which is part of the Logistics and Manufacturing Services segment and has approximately $150 million of goodwill, decreased considerably from 2009. While the estimated fair value is substantially in excess of its carrying value, further declines may occur depending on its future cash flows that are significantly impacted by the economy in the regions served, the retention of its customers, the cost and inventory level management initiatives of its customers, continuation of existing sales volume and effectiveness and size of its sale force. While management expects future operating improvements to result from improving end-market conditions, further market penetration, sales force productivity initiatives and the expected benefits of prior restructuring actions there can be no assurance that such expectations will be met or that the fair value of the reporting unit will continue to exceed its carrying value. If its fair value were to fall below its carrying value, a non-cash impairment charge to income from operations could result.       Revenue Sharing Programs:  The Company participates in aftermarket RSPs under which the Company receives an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program. As consideration, the Company has paid participation fees, which are recorded as long-lived intangible assets, and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to 30 years. The Company records amortization of the related long-lived intangible asset as sales dollars are being earned based on a proportional sales dollar method. Specifically, this method amortizes each intangible asset as a reduction to revenue based on the proportion of sales under a program in a given period to the estimated aggregate sales dollars over the life of that program. This method reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are realized.       The recoverability of each intangible asset is subject to significant estimates about future revenues related to the programs aftermarket parts. The Company evaluates these intangible assets for impairment and updates amortization rates on an agreement by agreement basis. The intangible assets are reviewed for impairment        30            whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Annually, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Management updates revenue projections, which includes comparing actual experience against projected revenue and industry projections. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions. A shortfall in future revenues may indicate a triggering event requiring an impairment test of the intangible asset or require the Company to accelerate amortization expense prospectively dependant on the level of the shortfall. The Company has not identified any impairment of these intangible assets. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Reorganization of Businesses:  The Company records the cost of reorganization initiatives at the time the liability is incurred. The liability includes those costs that can be reasonably estimated and are probable of payment within a reasonable period of time. These estimates are subject to adjustments based upon actual costs incurred.        Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits:  Accounting policies and significant assumptions related to pension and other postretirement benefits are disclosed in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       The following table provides a breakout of the current targeted mix of investments, by asset classification, along with the historical rates of return for each asset class and the long-term projected rates of return for the U.S. plans.                              Target Asset Mix %         Annual Return %                 Historical   (1)         Long- Term Projection        Asset class                          Large cap growth         17             9.4             9.2         Large cap value         17             11.5             11.1         Mid cap equity         12             12.6             12.1         Small cap growth         7             7.1             7.1         Small cap value         7             12.6             12.1         Non-U.S. equity         10             9.3             8.8         Real estate-related         5             11.9             8.9         Fixed income         20             8.9             6.4         Cash         5             5.6             3.6         Weighted average                10.0             9.0            (1)  Historical returns based on the life of the respective index, approximately 30 years.       The historical rates of return were calculated based upon compounded average rates of return of published indices. The 25% aggregate target for fixed income and cash investments is lower than the fixed income and cash component of a typical pension trust. The fixed income investments include a higher-than-average component of yield-aggressive investments, including high-yield corporate bonds. Based on the overall historical and projected rates of return of the targeted asset mix, management is using the long-term rate of return on its U.S. pension assets of 9.0%. The long-term rates of return for non-U.S. plans were selected based on actual historical rates of return of published indices that were used to measure the plans target asset allocations. Historical rates were then discounted to consider fluctuations in the historical rates as well as potential changes in the investment environment.       The discount rate used for the Companys U.S. pension plans reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. At December 31, 2010, the Company selected a discount rate of 5.65% based on a bond matching model for its U.S. pension plans. The discount rates for non-U.S. plans were selected based on bond matching models or on indices of high-quality bonds using criteria applicable to the respective countries.         31           A one-quarter percentage point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on the Companys U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2010 would impact the Companys 2011 pre-tax income by approximately $0.8 million annually. A one-quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2010 would decrease the Companys 2011 pre-tax income by approximately $1.0 million annually. The Company reviews these and other assumptions at least annually.       During 2010, the fair value of the Companys pension plan assets increased by $32.5 million and the projected benefit obligation increased $26.6 million due primarily to changes in actuarial assumptions. The Companys pension expense for 2010 was $1.6 million. Pension expense for 2011 is expected to increase by approximately $2 million as compared to 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses from previous asset performance and lower discount rates. The 2011 expense estimate does not include potential future settlement costs.       Income Taxes:  As of December 31, 2010, the Company had recognized $53.2 million of deferred tax assets, net of valuation reserves, principally in the United States. The realization of these benefits is dependent in part on the amount and timing of future taxable income in the jurisdictions where deferred tax assets reside. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carry forwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. Management believes that sufficient taxable income will be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowances recorded.       The United States deferred tax assets include significant tax operating loss carryforwards. If it became more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would expire unused, the Company would record a valuation allowance to reflect this fact. The Company has recently experienced challenging economic conditions in the United States; however, the Company is not in a cumulative loss position over the last three years (defined as pre-tax book income plus permanent tax items) and does not currently project to be in a cumulative loss position through 2011. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment. Managements assessment that these deferred tax assets will be realized represents its estimate of future results; however, there can be no assurance that such expectations will be met. Changes in managements assessment of achieving sufficient future taxable income could materially increase the Companys tax expense and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Management will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in the future.        Additionally, the Company is exposed to certain tax contingencies in the ordinary course of business and, accordingly, records those tax liabilities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. For those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Stock-Based Compensation:  The Company accounts for its stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value on the grant date and recognizes the related cost in its consolidated statement of income in accordance with accounting standards related to share-based payments. The fair values of stock options are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on certain assumptions. The fair values of other stock awards are estimated based on the fair market value of the Companys stock price on the grant date. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.        EBITDA       Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2010 was $136.9 million compared to $114.0 million in 2009. EBITDA is a measurement not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company defines EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization which the Company incurs in the normal course of         32            business. The Company does not intend EBITDA to represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider it as an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of the Companys operating performance. The Companys definition of EBITDA may not be comparable with EBITDA as defined by other companies. The Company believes EBITDA is commonly used by financial analysts and others in the industries in which the Company operates and, thus, provides useful information to investors. Accordingly, the calculation has limitations depending on its use.       Following is a reconciliation of EBITDA to the Companys net income (in millions):                           2010         2009        Net income      $  53.3          $  39.0         Add back:                   Interest expense         20.0             22.6         Income taxes         10.8             0.9         Depreciation and amortization         52.8             51.5                                     EBITDA      $  136.9          $  114.0                                        33           Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. The Companys financial results could be impacted by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity price changes. The Company uses financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.    SIZE="1">    The Companys long-term debt portfolio consists of fixed-rate and variable-rate instruments and is managed to reduce the overall cost of borrowing while also minimizing the effect of changes in interest rates on near-term earnings. The Companys primary interest rate risk is derived from its outstanding variable-rate debt obligations. In 2008, the Company entered into two, three-year interest rate swap agreements which together converted the interest on the first $100.0 million of the Companys London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based borrowings from a variable rate plus the borrowing spread to a fixed rate of 2.947% plus the borrowing spread for the purpose of mitigating its exposure to variable interest rates. At December 31, 2010, the result of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average cost of the Companys variable-rate debt would have reduced annual pretax profit by $2.0 million.        STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">At December 31, 2010, the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate debt was $159.1 million, compared with its carrying amount of $152.4 million. The Company estimates that a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31, 2010 would have increased the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate debt to $160.1 million.       The Company has manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and conducts business transactions denominated in various currencies. The currencies of the locations where the Companys business operations are conducted include the U.S. dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. The Company is exposed primarily to financial instruments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at its international locations. A 10% adverse change in all currencies at December 31, 2010 would have resulted in a $0.2 million loss in the fair value of those financial instruments.       Foreign currency commitments and transaction exposures are managed at the operating units as an integral part of their businesses in accordance with a corporate policy that addresses acceptable levels of foreign currency exposures. At December 31, 2010, the Company did not hedge its foreign currency net investment exposures. Prior to December 31, 2008, the Company had entered into a series of forward currency contracts to hedge a portion of its foreign currency net investment exposure in Barnes Group Canada Corp. for the purpose of mitigating exposure to foreign currency volatility on its future return on capital. In 2008, the Company terminated this hedge and received a payment of $1.9 million at termination.       Additionally, to reduce foreign currency exposure, management maintains the majority of foreign cash and short-term investments in local currency and uses forward currency contracts for non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions in an effort to reduce the effect of the volatility of changes in foreign exchange rates on the income statement. In historically weaker currency countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, management assesses the strength of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may elect during periods of local currency weakness to invest excess cash in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments.        The Companys exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high-grade steel spring wire, titanium and other specialty metals and the distribution operations which distribute products made of steel, copper and brass. The Company attempts to manage its exposure to increases in those prices through its procurement and sales practices.         34           Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
