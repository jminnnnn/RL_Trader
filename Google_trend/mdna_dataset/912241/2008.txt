Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein. Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include risks detailed in Part I, Item I under the caption Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    General Information    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> We are a global supplier of integrated casino and jackpot management solutions for the gaming industry. This technology is widely used to enhance casino operations and help drive greater revenues for existing products. Our products include multiple forms of regulated wagering solutions in wired, wireless and mobile formats.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> We offer a suite of products that when combined, supports every facet of a gaming operation, and consolidates the management of slot machines, table games, server-based gaming, account wagering, marketing and cage into one fully integrated system. The system can support from one venue to several hundred venues in a multi-site configuration. Our revenues from continuing operations are primarily comprised of upfront payments and recurring fees for software, hardware and support services.    Previously, we also developed, acquired, licensed and distributed table and slot games, and manufactured and sold interior casino signage and related products. In 2004, we announced a plan to reposition our business to focus solely on technology and game content. In 2005, we completed the sale of our interior signage division and made several acquisitions of technology and systems-based companies, which are more fully described below. During 2007, the sale of our table games division to Shuffle Master, and the divestiture of our remaining slot operations and slot inventory marked the completion of our transition to a company that is solely focused on achieving sustainable revenue growth from recurring systems placements.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> With respect to our operating segments, prior to June 30, 2007 our operations included both systems and table and slot game segments. As a result of the sale of our slot and table businesses, we have classified the slot and table games segment as a discontinued operation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assetssee Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate performance and allocate resources to our operating segments based upon profit or loss from operations before income taxes. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of critical accounting policies below.    Strategic Transactions     In connection with our plan to reposition the company as a provider of integrated casino systems solutions, we completed the following strategic transactions during the most recent three fiscal years:                   During 2007, we completed two equity offerings resulting in net cash proceeds of $75.3 million after transaction costs.    STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">               On September 28, 2007, we completed the sale of our table games division (TGD) to Shuffle Master for which we received cash proceeds of approximately $19.8 million. The purchase agreement related to that sale also provides for earn-out payments based on the installed base growth of the TGD assets through 2016 (subject to certain conditions), including $3.5 million in guaranteed minimum payments expected to be realized over the next four years.                   During 2005 and 2006 we completed a number of strategic transactions. We strengthened our portfolio of intellectual property through the acquisitions of EndX, VirtGame and PitTrak, and through a technology licensing agreement and minority investment in Magellan. We also entered into strategic agreements with IGT and Shuffle Master for the table management business, Cantor Gaming for the sports and poker business and Elixir Gaming for the growing Asian casino management business, and disposed of our interior signage division.         35          Results of Operations    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Revenues and Cost of Revenues                           (amounts in thousands, except installed base amounts)      Year Ended December 31,      Percentage Change             2007      2006      2005      07 vs. 06        06 vs. 05        Systems revenues and gross profit:                                  Revenues      $  70,984      $  54,669      $  49,449      29.8  %     10.6  %     Cost of revenues         32,109         27,695         28,112      15.9  %     (1.5  )%                                                Gross profit      $  38,875      $  26,974      $  21,337      44.1  %     26.4  %                                                System installation base                                  Slot management         76,339         59,000         49,700      29.4  %     18.7  %     Table management         5,740         2,947         1,980      94.8  %     48.8  %    Overview.  In December 2004, we announced our intent to focus our business on game content and technology, and we have completed several strategic transactions since this decision. With the completion of the table and slot games divestitures during 2007, we have now completed this repositioning of our business. The operations of the disposed slot and table games businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations for all period presented, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). The sole component of our revenues from continuing operations is now systems revenue, which is generated primarily from the sale and servicing of modular and integrated casino management systems.    The key business metric used by management is slot and table management system installed base, representing the number of slot machines or table games that are connected to our systems and daily fees which represent the recurring payments made by the customer for the software maintenance or other ongoing services and products.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Systems revenues and gross profit.  Our systems revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $71 million, representing growth of 29.8% over 2006 levels. The improvement in systems revenues in 2007 was due primarily to increased demand for our Casinolink Enterprise (Casinolink) system, particularly in Canada, Europe and Asia, and further expansion of our table management systems. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, our slot management revenues improved by approximately $11.1 million over 2006 from both the international expansion of Casinolink and further placements of our CJS. Table management systems revenues increased by approximately $2.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of new implementations in the United States and Asia. We expect further growth in Casinolink placements in these regions, particularly in Asia where gaming is experiencing significant growth. Increased placements of our Casinolink Jackpot Systems (CJS) also contributed to improvements in our systems revenues and gross profit margins. CJS was introduced to the United States market in mid-2006, and we received approval for field trials in Nevada during the second half of 2007. Upon successful completion of the field trials, CJS is expected to be commercialized in Nevada, and we expect this jurisdiction to be a significant opportunity during 2008 and beyond. Our installed base of slot management systems grew to 76,339 in 2007 compared to 59,000 in 2006, an increase of 29.4%. Gross profit margins increased by $11.9 million or 44.1% in 2007 compared to 2006.   Our installed base of table management systems almost doubled from 2006 to 2007, growing by almost 95% from 2,947 in 2006 to 5,740 in 2007. Our table management growth was driven primarily by initial installations of systems at corporate accounts and other large customers in the United States as well as expansion in Macau, China. We expect further growth in our table management business in 2008 and beyond as these large United States customers expand their table management systems to other properties, and through increased placements in Asia and Europe. The improvement in gross margins reported in fiscal 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily due to higher software license revenues, higher recurring revenue installed base, and better leverage on our fixed service costs.         36          During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, our systems revenues were $54.7 million, representing an increase of 10.6% compared to 2005. This improvement in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to increased demand for our systems. During 2006 our table management installed base, which includes our legacy TableLink system and Table iD, grew by approximately 48.8% compared to 2005 levels. Our slot management installed base showed an 18.7% growth in fiscal 2006 compared to 2005, and our gross profit during 2006 grew by 26.4% or $5.6 million over 2005 levels.

SG&A expenses decreased by $4.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This decrease was primarily attributable to non-recurring charges during 2006 consisting of $2.8 million in legal fees and settlements, $0.6 million in consulting fees, and $0.2 million in other charges. In addition, non-cash stock compensation included in SG&A, excluding amounts related to severance, decreased to $2.5 million in 2007 from $4.7 million in the prior year primarily as a result of charges related to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of 2006.    SG&A expenses increased by $12.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. This increase was primarily due to additional legal and compliance costs necessary to continue to achieve regulatory approvals for our new products, legal fees incurred in connection with ongoing litigation matters, legal settlements, relocation and restructuring charges for our international operations, and separation and post-          37           employment agreement costs. In addition, non-cash charges for stock compensation expense were $4.7 million for 2006 compared with $0.7 million in 2005 as a result of the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of 2006.    Research and development expense (R&D).  R&D expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for design and development of our product lines. During 2007, research and development expenses decreased by $0.3 million compared to 2006 primarily as a result of lower contractor expenses related to product compliance and testing.    During 2006, research and development expense increased by 52.7% over 2005, as a result of increased spending to meet our product development timelines and achieve our strategic objectives.    SIZE="2"> Depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of higher amortization expense related to additions to our intellectual property portfolio.   Depreciation and amortization increased $4.9 million during 2006 compared to 2005, primarily as a result of amortization expense for intangible assets acquired through our purchases of EndX and VirtGame, which were completed in late 2005.    Net gain on disposition of non-core assets.  During the second quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of the interior sign division, which resulted in a gain of approximately $7.1 million including transaction costs and other costs related to the disposal.   Gain on sale of core intellectual property.  During the third quarter of 2005, we completed a strategic licensing transaction whereby we sold the remaining rights to certain intellectual property in a barter transaction, and retained a non-exclusive license in the intellectual property for use in our operations.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Interest expense, net.  Our interest expense primarily includes interest costs and amortization of debt issuance costs from our 11.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2008 and our former senior secured term credit facility. Net interest expense for 2007 was $10.4 million compared to $7.8 million for 2006. The increase of $2.6 million is attributable primarily to higher outstanding borrowings under our former credit facility and a $1.2 million waiver fee incurred during 2007, partially offset by a decrease related to the retirement of $32.3 million in debt during 2007.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> During 2006, net interest expense decreased by $0.7 million as compared to 2005 as a result of the retirement of $20 million of our Senior Secured Notes during the fourth quarter of 2005, partially offset by interest expense on our former senior secured credit facility.    Loss on early retirement of debt.  During 2007 we recognized a non-cash charge of $3.3 million on the early retirement of debt. This charge represents a write-off of $3.1 million in prepaid debt issue costs, including the unamortized fair value of warrants issued to lenders on our $22.5 million senior secured credit facility, and a $0.2 million write-off of prepaid debt issue costs and debt discount related to the early retirement of $15 million of our Senior Secured Notes. During 2005, we recorded a $3.0 million loss on the early retirement of $20.0 million of our Senior Secured Notes. Of this charge, $1.2 million was a call premium paid in cash, and $1.8 million was a non-cash charge related to writing off related debt discount and prepaid debt issue costs.    Income taxes.  We recorded a tax provision of $1.3 million for 2007, representing a non-cash charge to increase the valuation allowance for previously recognized deferred tax assets. We did not recognize a tax benefit or provision related to our domestic operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 or 2005 due to our net operating loss position.    Discontinued operations.  Discontinued operations includes the earnings and losses of the slot and table games operations, which were disposed of during the second half of 2007. For the year ended December 31,          38           2007, we recorded a charge of $67.4 million representing a $25.9 million impairment charge for adjustment of the carrying values of the assets involved in the sale, a $24.7 million charge for the table games related Webb vs. Mikohn legal settlement, and a total of $16.8 million representing operating losses and other charges related to the disposed segment. Operating results of our discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were a loss of $0.9 million and income of $8.7 million, net of an impairment charge of $4.5 million related to legacy slot hardware issues, respectively. All earnings and losses of discontinued operations are presented net of taxes.    Loss per share.  For the year ended December 31, 2007 we incurred a loss from continuing operations per fully-diluted share of $0.68 compared to a loss of $1.04 from continuing operations per fully diluted share for 2006, based on weighted average shares of 40.0 million and 34.5 million, respectively. The 34.6% improvement in loss per share resulted primarily from increased gross margins and reduced costs during 2007, partially offset by increased interest expense and loss on early retirement of debt. The loss from continuing operations per fully-diluted share for 2005 was $0.59, based on weighted average shares of 25.1 million. The 76.3% increase in loss per share during 2006 over 2005 resulted primarily from increases in operating costs during 2006 over 2005 levels.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"> Liquidity and Capital Resources    We have generated net losses from operations of $94.5 million, $36.6 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and have an accumulated deficit of $245.0 million at December 31, 2007. We have used cash in operating activities of $49.0 million, $12.1 million and $21.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. We have generated net cash from investing and financing activities of $60.7 million, $5.3 million and $23.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.    We have total cash and cash equivalents of $19.1 million and a net working capital deficit of $4.8 million at December 31, 2007. The net working capital deficit includes $30 million of our 11.875% Senior Secured Notes due in August 2008. We believe that existing cash on hand ($19.1 million at December 31, 2007), cash generated from operations during 2008 and proceeds of future financing will be sufficient sources of capital to repay the $30 million 11.875% Senior Secured Notes on their due date and meet other working capital requirements through at least December 31, 2008. However, if events or circumstances occur such that we do not meet our plans as expected or are unable to obtain future financing, we would not be able to meet our obligations. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or available at all. Any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Net cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007 were $19.1 million, an increase of $11.9 million compared to December 31, 2006. This change resulted from net cash provided by financing activities of $43.4 million, partially offset by cash used in continuing operating activities of $14.7 million, cash used in continuing investing activities of $2.0 million, net cash used in discontinued operations of $15.0 million, and $0.2 million in effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents.         39          Significant components of cash flows from continuing operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 are as follows:                (Amounts in millions)               Net loss      $  (94.5  )     Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax         67.4                       Net loss from continuing operations         (27.1  )     Depreciation and amortization         7.3        Stock based compensation         3.6        Amortization of debt discount and issue costs         2.4        Impairment of long-lived asset         0.9        Loss on early retirement of debt         3.3        Other, primarily changes in assets and liabilities         (5.1  )                    Net cash used in continuing operating activities      $  (14.7  )                   Other significant sources (uses) of cash during 2007 were $19.8 million proceeds from the sale of the table games division, $76.3 million from the issuance of common stock, $(32.7) million used for repayments of long-term debt, net of $3.2 million in additional borrowings, and $(1.9) million used for purchases of property and equipment and investment in intellectual property. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we completed numerous capital transactions, including the completion of a private placement of equity in August for approximately $31 million, the sale of our worldwide table games division in September for upfront payments of approximately $20 million and fixed and variable payments through 2017, and the sale of common stock pursuant to a registered offering in November of approximately $50 million. The proceeds raised through the aforementioned transactions were primarily used to repay a significant portion of our long-term debt, to settle the majority of our legal matters, and to improve working capital and pay installment payments for intellectual property.    The following table summarizes our contractual obligations for long-term debt, capital leases, interest expense, operating leases, license fees and employment agreements for the periods shown:                           (Amount in thousands)       Total      Less than 1 year      1  3 Years      4  5 Years      After 5 Years     Current portion of long-term debt      $  29,852      $  29,852      $          $          $         Interest expense         3,563         3,563                                      Operating leases         6,419         2,670         3,229         520                License / development         2,793         1,281         575         937                Employment agreements         252         252                                                                                          Total      $  42,879      $  37,618      $  3,804      $  1,457      $                                                            The table above excludes accretion of debt discount of $0.1 million for the periods shown.   Management is currently evaluating alternatives to refinance the $30 million in Senior Secured Notes including additional debt financing and partial use of cash on hand.    Employment Agreements    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We have entered into employment contracts with our corporate officers and certain other key employees. Significant contract provisions in some of these employment contracts include minimum annual base salaries,         40           healthcare benefits, life insurance benefits, bonus compensation if performance measures are achieved, changes in control (CIC), grants of restricted stock, incentive stock options and non-compete provisions. These contracts are primarily at will employment agreements, under which we or the employee may terminate employment. If we terminate any of these employees without cause, then we are obligated to pay the employee severance benefits as specified in their individual contract.    Purchase Commitments    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> From time to time, we enter into commitments with our vendors to purchase inventory at fixed prices or in guaranteed quantities. From time to time we also enter into certain intellectual property license arrangements that require upfront payments upon signing and/or additional payments upon our election to renew the licenses. In addition, we may choose to negotiate and renew licenses upon their normal expiration. No assurances can be given as to the terms of such renewals, if any.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> We have no off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons.    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Capital Expenditures and Other    During 2007, we spent approximately $1 million for purchase of property and equipment, primarily for expansion of our facilities in Macau, and additions to office and computer equipment used in our operations.    SIZE="2"> Share Repurchase Plan    On August 13, 2002 our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $2.0 million of our common stock. The purchases may be made from time to time in the open market. The timing and actual number of shares to be purchased will depend on market conditions. Through December 31, 2007, we have purchased 175,800 shares of our common stock for approximately $0.5 million, all of which occured during 2002.    Critical Accounting Policies    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant estimates, judgments and assumptions, that we believe are reasonable, in calculating the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of known industry trends, and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. On a regular basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to lives assigned to our assets, the determination of bad debts, inventory valuation reserves, asset impairment and self-insurance reserves. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates.    We have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations: revenue recognition, receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories and obsolescence, long-lived asset impairment, and stock-based compensation. To provide an understanding of the methodology we apply these and other significant accounting policies discussed below and where appropriate in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"> Revenue Recognition    We recognize revenue depending on the line of business as described below. As documentation for a transaction commitment, we requires a properly authorized writing from the customer specifying transaction          41           terms and conditions, such as a contract signed by the customer or an approved customer purchase order or another approved form. We may require additional documentation to support revenue recognition including receipt of shipment, a signed customer installation ticket or a signed customer acceptance ticket as more fully described below:    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Slot and Table Games.  Prior to our disposal of the slot and tables games divisions, our revenue recognition policies for slot and table games were as follows. We leased and sold proprietary slot and table games to casino customers. Table game lease contracts were typically for a 36-month period with a 30-day cancellation clause. The lease revenue was recognized on a monthly basis. Slot machine lease contracts were either on revenue participation or a fixed-rental basis. Slot machine lease contracts were typically for a month-to-month period with a 30-day cancellation clause. On a participation basis, we earned a share of the revenue that the casino earned from these slot machines. On a fixed-rental basis, we charged a fixed amount per slot machine per day. Revenues from both types of lease arrangements were recognized on the accrual basis. The sales agreements for proprietary table games and slot games consisted of the sale of hardware and a perpetual license for the proprietary intellectual property. Slot and table game sales were executed by a signed contract or a customer purchase order. Revenues for these sales agreements were generally recognized when the hardware and intellectual property was delivered to the customer.    Systems.  Our systems sales generally include a combination of proprietary hardware and software components. We account for system sales in accordance with Statement of Position 97- 2, Software Revenue Recognition (SOP 97-2). System sales are evidenced by a signed contract. Follow-up spare parts and hardware-only sales are evidenced by a purchase order or other approved form. Revenue for system sales is generally recognized when: (i) there is an arrangement with a fixed determinable price; (ii) collectibility of the sale is probable; and (iii) the hardware and software have been delivered, installed, training has been completed and customer acceptance has occurred.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Not all systems contracts require installation. Examples include sales of hardware only to (i) previous customers that are expanding their systems, (ii) customers that have multiple locations and perform the installation themselves and require an additional software licenses and hardware and (iii) customers purchasing spare parts.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Postcontract Customer Support.  Maintenance and support for substantially all of our products are sold under agreements with established vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value in accordance with the applicable accounting literature. These contracts are generally for a period of three years and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract service period. Further professional services are also sold under agreements with established vendor-specific objective evidence of price, which is based on daily rates and is recognized as the services are provided.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> License Arrangements.  A significant portion of our revenues are generated from the license of intellectual property, software and game content. These licenses are sold on a stand-alone basis or in multiple element arrangements. Revenue is recognized from these transactions in accordance with the applicable accounting literature. Revenues under perpetual license arrangements are generally recognized when the license is delivered. Revenues under fixed term arrangements are generally recognized over the term of the arrangement or in a manner consistent with the earnings process. For arrangements with multiple deliverables, revenue is generally recognized as the elements are delivered so long as the undelivered elements have established fair values as required in the applicable accounting literature.    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Interior Signage.  Prior to the disposal of the interior signage division in 2005, signage sales were executed by a signed contract or customer purchase order. Revenue was recognized when the completed product was delivered. If the agreement called for us to perform an installation after delivery, revenue related to the installation was recognized when the installation has been completed and accepted by the customer.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">      42          Inventory and Obsolescence    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We routinely evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, estimated service period, product end of life dates, estimated current and future market values, service inventory requirements and new product introductions, as well as other factors. Purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure. Raw materials and work in progress with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed at least quarterly by our engineering and operating personnel for obsolescence. Such raw material and work in progress write-downs are typically caused by engineering change orders or product end of life adjustments. Finished goods are reviewed at least quarterly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices. Service inventory is systematically reserved for based on the estimated remaining service life of the inventory. We record reserves for inventory based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand in our analysis. In 2005, we reduced our reserves through write-offs of obsolete inventories and adjusted the level of reserves in accordance with our accounting policies. In the second quarter of 2006, we increased our reserves by approximately $0.9 million due primarily to charges resulting from the European Unions adoption of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in electronic equipment (RoHS) initiative on July 1, 2006 and due to charges resulting from slot machine parts deemed no longer saleable. If circumstances related to our inventories change, our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change.    SIZE="2">Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costsan amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. The amendment clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact to our overall results of operations or financial position.    Long-Lived Asset Impairment   Long-lived assets and intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment quarterly or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. We evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expect the assets to generate. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources in the future, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets.    In accordance with SFAS No. 142 and SFAS No. 144, we perform an impairment analysis on all of our long-lived and intangible assets on an annual basis and in certain other circumstances. For indefinite lived assets including perpetual licenses and goodwill, management performs an annual valuation to determine if any impairment has occurred. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment test from the last day of our third quarter (September 30) to the first day of our fourth quarter (October 1). We selected this date to perform our annual goodwill impairment test because we believe this date is preferable in these circumstances, as it better aligns the timing of the testing with our long-range planning process, which is expected to result in efficiencies and savings in professional fees. In addition, the October 1 test date is preferable because it allows more time for management to plan and execute its review of the completeness and accuracy of the impairment testing process. This change did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. The valuation tests as of September 30, 2007, October 1, 2007 and September 30, 2006 did not indicate any impairment.         43          Income Taxes    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.    Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.    Stock-Based Compensation     Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)) which establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that is based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. The primary focus of this pronouncement is on issuing share-based payments for services provided by employees. This pronouncement also requires recognition of compensation expense for new equity instruments awarded or for modifications, cancellations or repurchases of existing awards starting January 1, 2006. Compensation expense for new equity awards, in most cases, will be based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant and will be recognized over the vesting service period. An award of a liability instrument, as defined by this pronouncement, will initially be recorded at fair value and will be adjusted each reporting period to the new fair value through the date of settlement. Additionally, we have adopted the guidance in SAB 107,  Share-Based Payment,  which provides interpretive guidance on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense to the same financial statement line item as cash compensation, and therefore, may impact cost of sales and service, related gross profits and margins, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses.    SIZE="2">We elected the modified prospective application method contained in SFAS No. 123(R) to account for share-based payments. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we accounted for share-based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25), and related Interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB No. 25, no compensation cost was required to be recognized for options granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.   The principal effects of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) are:    STYLE="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">               The fair value of unvested outstanding options at the beginning of first quarter 2006 will be expensed over the remaining service period.        44                     Forfeitures over the expected term of the award are estimated at the date of grant and the estimates adjusted to reflect actual subsequent forfeitures. Previously, we had reflected forfeitures as they occurred. The effect of this change was not significant.                   Any tax benefits recognized as a result of the exercise of employee stock options would be classified as a financing cash flow. We have not recognized any tax benefits related to stock-based compensation cost as a result of the full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets and its net operating loss carryforwards.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Adoption of this pronouncement did not change the methodology we use to determine the fair value of our share-based compensation arrangements. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model for stock options and the grant date fair value of our common stock for restricted stock awards.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards    In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141(R)"). SFAS No. 141(R) replaces SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", but retains the requirement that the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions be used for all business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) expands on the disclosures previously required by SFAS No. 141, better defines the acquirer and the acquisition date in a business combination, and establishes principles for recognizing and measuring the assets acquired (including goodwill), the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquired business. SFAS No. 141(R) also requires an acquirer to record an adjustment to income tax expense for changes in valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions related to acquired businesses. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for all business combinations with an acquisition date in the first annual period following December 15, 2008; early adoption is not permitted. We will adopt this statement as of January 1, 2009. Management is currently evaluating the impact SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our consolidated financial statements.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amount attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interests. The statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosure that clearly identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and those of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements and eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 will be effective for us on January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) SFAS No. 157-2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP) SFAS No. 157-2) that deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 on our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations.    In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and certain other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair value.          45           Subsequent changes in fair value for designated items will be required to be reported in earnings in the current period. SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements for similar types of assets and liabilities measured at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the effect of implementing this guidance, which depends on the nature and extent of items elected to be measured at fair value, upon initial application of the standard on January 1, 2008.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px">  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Market Risk    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"> Foreign Currency Risk    There are two types of foreign currency exchange risks that a company may be subject to: transaction and translation gains or losses. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are distinguished from translation gains or losses as follows: (i) translation adjustments do not involve the movement of cash, they are accounting conversion calculations of an existing functional currency to a reporting currency and (ii) transaction gain or losses, however, are based on an actual transaction that requires formal payment at a future point in time.    We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk relating to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries asset, liability, income and expense accounts. Our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at the end of the relevant period. The income and expense accounts are translated using the average rate of exchange during the relevant period. Due to the long-term nature of our investment in our foreign operations, most of our intercompany transactions and translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component in stockholders equity. Although we do not regularly incur gains or losses from specific foreign currency transactions and do not believe that these amounts are material, these gains and losses are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we did not have any forwards, options or other derivative contracts in force. We do not consider our existing foreign currency translation exposure to be material.    Interest Rate Risk    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> We have total interest-bearing debt of approximately $30 million before discounts. The entire balance has a fixed rate of interest and therefore, is not exposed to the fluctuation of market interest rates.    Any future borrowings will be exposed to market rate risk. We periodically review our interest rate exposure, if any, on our long-term debt and, as market conditions warrant, we may enter into an interest rate cap or swap agreements in order to manage this exposure. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we did not have any such agreements in force.
