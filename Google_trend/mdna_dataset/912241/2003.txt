Item 7.	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  GENERAL      Amounts disclosed in the accompanying tables are shown in thousands while amounts included in text are disclosed in actual amounts.  RESTRUCTURING PLAN - 2002      During the third quarter of 2002, the Company initiated a restructuring plan for certain of its operations.  The restructuring plan was designed to achieve various objectives, principally related to reducing costs, streamlining operations and improving financial performance on an ongoing basis. The Company's Board of Directors approved the plan in August 2002, which was subsequently acted upon by management during the third quarter of 2002.  The principal restructuring initiatives included:       *	Replacing the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and           certain other executives;      *	Eliminating approximately 20% of the Company's permanent work force;      *	Divesting non-core business units and product lines;      *	Disposing under-utilized assets;      *	Consolidating interior sign production capacity into one facility;      *	Streamlining certain of the Company's warehousing and slot route           assembly operations; and      *	Outsourcing and streamlining certain of the Company's international           sign operations.      The actions taken on these initiatives are expected to yield the following results (amounts are approximate):       *	Annualized cost savings of $7.0 million from reducing the Company's           permanent work force head count by approximately 130 employees. The           headcount reductions did not effect the Company's Research and           Development or Sales departments;      *	Annualized rental and occupancy expense reductions from the           consolidating or divesting of assembly facilities of $1.0 million;      *	Annualized savings of $0.8 million from the divesting of its           exterior sign business;      *	Annualized expense reduction of $1.2 million from the departure of           former officers of the Company, which will be offset by the hiring           of other key officers and employees.      As a result of implementing the above initiatives, the Company recorded certain restructuring expenses, severance expenses, a loss from discontinued operations and certain other significant operating costs in the third quarter of 2002.  The Company also recorded an impairment loss relating to certain of its indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets, property and equipment and inventories. These impairment charges were recorded based on valuation analyses whereby it was determined that cash flow, earnings and other key operational criteria no longer supported the carrying values of these assets. In addition, the Company recorded a charge to write-down the assets of its exterior sign operations, net of expected proceeds. The charges totaled $27.8 million for the third quarter and $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, and are described below.  RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE      Included in the restructuring expense caption of Consolidated Statements of Operations is approximately $0.9 million of principally non-officer employee severance costs for approximately 130 terminated employees related to the restructuring plan.  Excluding the Company's research and development and sales personnel, all employee groups within the Company were affected by the terminations.  At December 31, 2002, approximately $0.1 million of this restructuring expense remains to be paid.      Additionally, a restructuring charge of approximately $3.3 million was taken to record the present value of long-term building lease commitments which, in accordance with the actions taken by the Company, will not be utilized as of specified dates as certain business operations have been streamlined, consolidated or divested.  The    leases are for one building located in Gulfport, Mississippi and for two buildings located in Las Vegas, Nevada.   The building lease in Mississippi has a term which expires in approximately 13 years, while the two leases in Nevada have terms expiring in July 2004 and in 2017.  On a quarterly basis through July 2004, the Company plans to remit cash of approximately $0.3 million under the lease agreements, net of sublease rental amounts. Subsequent to July 2004, the Company plans to remit cash of approximately $0.1 million quarterly.  The Company is currently subleasing one of the Las Vegas buildings and is currently seeking tenants for subleasing the other buildings.      Also included in restructuring expenses were write-downs of certain property and equipment to their net realizable value in relation to the curtailment of planned business operations with certain assembly facilities and the sale of certain real estate. Specifically, a charge for approximately $1.5 million was recorded for various leasehold improvements, machinery and equipment and real estate.  Of the $1.5 million, a building owned by the Company in Las Vegas, Nevada, was sold for approximately $0.5 million less than its book value of $2.2 million.  The Company realized net cash proceeds of $1.7 million from this sale in November 2002.  The Company is attempting to sell the machinery and equipment no longer used in the ongoing operations of the Company.      The restructuring expense is not included in the calculation of operating income in the tables shown below.  SEVERANCE EXPENSE      Included in the severance expense caption in the Company's consolidated statement of operations are charges for the separation and post-employment agreements of the Company's former CEO, CFO and another officer.  Including severance and other provisions of the agreements, the total charge was approximately $4.8 million of which $1.8 million in cash payments were made during the year ended December 31, 2002.  Approximately $0.6 million of the severance expense was applied by the former CEO and CFO to repay outstanding loans and advances owed to the Company.  At December 31, 2002, approximately $2.2 million remained unpaid to these individuals.  However, in March 2003, the Company paid its former CEO all remaining amounts owed him under the chief executive officer severance agreement totaling $1.4 million in conjunction with his retirement as chairman of the board of directors. On a quarterly basis through July 2003, the remaining required quarterly payments to the remaining individuals approximate $0.2 million.  Subsequent to July 2003 through August 2006, the Company is required to pay approximately $0.2 million annually.      The severance expense is not included in the calculation of operating income in the tables shown below.  IMPAIRMENT LOSS      An impairment loss was recorded during the third quarter of 2002 for certain definite-lived intangible assets.  Management ascertained that certain of its definite-lived intangible assets no longer generated sufficient actual or anticipated future revenues, earnings or cash flows. Based thereon, the Company recorded approximately $3.9 million in write-downs of these impaired intangible assets. The write-downs consisted primarily of a license agreement related to certain table game hardware of approximately $1.0 million, software costs related to Monopoly(r) table games of approximately $0.6 million, proprietary rights and software development costs related to certain components of our table game tracking system of approximately $1.5 million and capitalized costs associated with patents that are no longer deemed useful of approximately $0.7 million.      The Company maintains certain indefinite-lived intangible assets as part of its consolidated financial statements, principally in a perpetual license related to its casino table game operations and, to a limited extent, goodwill related to its slot route operations and international operations. An independent valuation test as of January 1, 2002 and September 30, 2002 did not result in any impairment.  However, as a result of the Company's divestiture of its Latin American subsidiary, goodwill related to the Latin American subsidiary was deemed to have been impaired during the third quarter of 2002. Therefore, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $0.4 million.      In connection with the restructuring initiatives and a third quarter valuation review of its long-lived assets, the Company determined that the assets described below no longer generated sufficient cash flow to support their carrying value. These assets are comprised of approximately 200 reel- spinning slot machines and certain non-branded assets including MoneyTime(tm), a proprietary jackpot system consisting of slot machines, signs, meters and    related electronics. The impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to these assets totaled approximately $1.7 million. Additionally, the Company decided to no longer use certain trade show equipment, after returning from its annual trade show in September 2002, and recorded a charge for approximately $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2002.      The impairment loss is not included in the calculation of operating income in the tables shown below.      The company performs an impairment analysis on all of its long-lived and intangible assets on a quarterly basis. For indefinite lived assets, including perpetual licenses and goodwill, an independent valuation is performed at least annually to determine if any impairment has occurred.  OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES      The Company recorded various charges totaling approximately $4.0 million for inventory write-downs and approximately $4.3 million principally for provisions for doubtful receivables during the third quarter of 2002. These charges are included under the caption "Operating Costs" in the consolidated statements of operations.      Certain inventories were deemed obsolete in the quarter as the Company, in accordance with its restructuring plan, entered into arrangements to outsource certain international sign assembly operations and to discontinue the pursuit of certain European system sales related to the tracking of arcade devices.  These charges amounted to approximately $1.0 million. Additionally, the Company wrote down slow moving inventories for specialized electronic meters, slot machines and finished signs in the amount of approximately $3.0 million as targeted sales levels were not achieved.      On September 20, 2002, the Company completed the sale of its 50% interest in its Latin American subsidiary as part of the restructuring initiatives. A charge of approximately $1.8 million was recorded to reflect the difference between the sale price and an intercompany debt from the subsidiary to the Company. The Company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts totaling $2.5 million that includes $1.5 million to reserve a loan made to a company that in turn granted the Company an exclusive license to manufacture and distribute its video poker games.  Based on the debtor's financial condition and uncertainties surrounding the Company's future business plan related to the proprietary games, a provision for doubtful accounts was recorded. Various other uncertainties with other debtors caused the Company to record an additional $1.0 million of doubtful account provisions in the third quarter of 2002.  YEAR-END ASSET VALUATION AND CHARGES - 2001      A review and analysis performed during the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in the Company taking various charges in its fourth quarter for (i) impaired assets (principally goodwill and nonoperating fixed assets of approximately $1.7 million included in the "Impairment Loss" caption), (ii) receivables, including significant amounts owed from debtors who purchased certain patent and internet rights, for which collectibility is now considered doubtful (approximately $2.5 million which is included in the operating income segments below), (iii) inventory reserves, including those related to the energy crisis and the economic decline (approximately $1.4 million included in the operating income segments below), (iv) losses incurred in foreign operations due to the collapse of the Argentina economy and softness in the Australasian market (approximately $0.6 million included in revenues below) and (v) miscellaneous charges related to medical insurance claims and certain international slot leasing revenues of $1.0 million (included in operating income segments below).      Two of the Company's operating units operated at losses during 2001. Although the Company initially believed future business plans during 2001 did not necessitate impairment losses relating to these operating units, the downturn in the economy in the latter part of 2001 and an assessment of the backlog of these operating units in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 caused the Company to record an impairment loss of approximately $0.5 million, principally for goodwill of two of these operating units.  These charges relate to our corporate and product sales operations.      Additionally, the Company decided in the fourth quarter that it would no longer use certain long-lived operating assets.  Since these assets, principally related to trade shows, non-compete agreements and slot route revenue    production, were deemed to no longer benefit the Company, the Company recorded write-offs of approximately $1.2 million.  These charges relate to our corporate operations and our gaming operations business segment.      In the latter part of 2001, a debtor of the Company, whose obligation is secured by certain Internet and patent rights, defaulted.  The Company amended the debtor's payment terms but concluded after assessing the economic environment in late 2001 that it would be prudent to reserve the net receivable of $1.5 million. These charges relate to our gaming operations business segment.      Additional events in late 2001, including certain bankruptcy filings, customer disputes and slower paying debtors caused the Company to record an additional $1.3 million reserve in the fourth quarter.  These charges relate to our gaming operations and product sales business segments.      Additionally, reductions in the Company's backlog for certain interior sign and systems products in the fourth quarter, both domestically and internationally, indicated substantially slower inventory turnover and caused the Company to record additional inventory reserves of approximately $1.4 million.  These charges relate to our product sales business segment.      During the fourth quarter of 2001 and into the first quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the effect from the collapse of the Argentine economy was likely to have a material impact on the future operations of Mikohn Latin America.  Specifically, certain assets were deemed to be uncollectible or significantly impaired.  As a result, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $0.3 million for impairment of the Argentine assets in the fourth quarter of 2001.  Additionally, the Company deemed certain assets from its Australian subsidiary to be impaired based on the business unit's inability to generate expected positive cash flow in 2001 and for the foreseeable future.  An additional $0.3 million charge was recorded for those assets in the fourth quarter of 2001. These charges, totaling approximately $0.6 million, relate to our product sales business segment.      During the latter part of 2001, the Company incurred significant medical claims and related costs under its employee medical benefits plan.  These costs were approximately $0.3 million higher than in previous quarters and were caused principally by a few abnormally large claims.  In addition, charges of approximately $0.3 million and less than $0.1 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 due to a dispute with a previous medical claims administrator now in litigation and for other miscellaneous charges, respectively.  These charges, totaling approximately $0.6 million, relate to our corporate operations.      The Company incurred approximately $0.3 million in costs to convert a number of slot machines to comply with Canadian technical requirements in the latter part of 2001.  Based on a determination that these expenditures did not increase the value of the machines, the Company recorded a charge for these expenses.  These charges relate to our gaming operations business segment.  ACQUISITION / DIVESTITURE OF SUBSIDIARIES      On May 14, 2002, the Company acquired 1,744,403 shares of MGA from TAB Limited ("TAB").  These shares represented 8% of the issued and outstanding shares of MGA, increasing the Company's ownership in this subsidiary from 92% to 100%.  The purchase price for the shares was approximately $1.1 million, payable $0.8 million on closing and a promissory note for approximately $0.3 million.  The promissory note is due June 30, 2005 and bears interest at 5% per annum with principal and interest due at maturity.  Simultaneously with the purchase of these shares, the Company and TAB amended their existing licensing agreement granting TAB additional rights to operate a Mystery(r) Linked Jackpot system in New South Wales.  In consideration for these additional rights, TAB agreed to pay a fee of approximately $0.8 million within seven days after execution of the agreement and to pay an additional fee, aggregating a minimum of approximately $0.6 million over three years, in the amount of $8 per month per game connected to the system.  The Company and TAB agreed that monies owed by the Company to TAB for the purchase of the shares in MGA could be offset by the monies owed by TAB to the Company under the terms of the amended license agreement.      On September 20, 2002 the Company completed the sale of our remaining 50% interest in our Latin American subsidiary as part of the restructuring initiatives.  The interest was sold for approximately $0.4 million consisting of a cash payment of $0.1 million and a note for approximately $0.3 million which was paid in full on November 15,    2002, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. A charge of approximately $1.8 million was recorded to reflect the forgiveness of an intercompany debt from the subsidiary to the Company. As a result of the Company's divestiture of its Latin American Subsidiary, goodwill related to the Latin American subsidiary was deemed to have been impaired during the quarter ended September 30, 2002. Therefore, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $0.4 million.      During the third quarter of 2002, in connection with its restructuring plan, the Company decided to divest its exterior sign operations in the Product Sales segment.  On October 1, 2002 the Company reached a definitive agreement to sell the exterior sign operations.  The transaction closed on October 31, 2002 for $1.7 million, consisting of cash payments totaling $1.2 million and a note for $0.5 million paid on December 31, 2002 in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As a result of the sale, a charge of approximately $1.1 million related to the impairment of the exterior sign operations assets, net of the expected proceeds, was recorded. In addition, a charge of approximately $1.0 million for a long-term advertising lease deemed no longer useful to the entity was included in the loss from normal operations. The loss from discontinued operations is shown net of an income tax benefit of 34% applied to the pretax loss. The operating results of this business were previously included in the "Product Sales" segment and are presently reflected as "Discontinued Operations" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company entered into various material transactions with related parties. Specifically, the Company charged interest and other expense of approximately $0.2 million and sold approximately $0.2 million of products to its 50% owned, unconsolidated subsidiary in Latin America. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company sold its remaining 50% interest in its Latin American subsidiary as part of the restructuring initiatives. All sales and expense charges to or from affiliates were deemed to be arms-length transactions.      Included in "Notes receivable-related parties" at December 31, 2002 are amounts owed from a former officer and a former director of the Company that were due and payable October 30, 2002. The loans arose out of a stock purchase plan approved by the Board of Directors in October 1997. Under the plan, each person who elected to participate purchased shares of the Company's restricted common stock at the closing price on October 30, 1997. Each participant borrowed from the Company the entire purchase price for the shares of common stock he elected to buy. The loans are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by a pledge of the purchased shares. The Company has given notice that the loans are in default, has demanded payment and, on December 31, 2002, the Company foreclosed on the stock securing the promissory notes. The two defaulted loans, including interest, total approximately $0.3 million at December 31, 2002. In March 2003, the Company filed a claim against the former officer and agreed to payment terms with the former director in accordance with a promissory note.      David J. Thompson announced his resignation as chief executive officer effective August 16, 2002 and, on March 21, 2002, Mr. Thompson announced his retirement as chairman of the board of directors. According to the provisions of Mr. Thompson's chief executive officer severance agreement, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $3.3 million of which $1.5 million in cash payments were made during the year ended December 31, 2002.  Approximately $0.3 million of the chief executive officer severance agreement was applied by Mr. Thompson to repay outstanding loans and advances owed to the Company. At December 31, 2002, approximately $1.5 million remained unpaid of the chief executive officer severance agreement.  As part of his retirement package, the Company paid the remaining amounts owed Mr. Thompson under the chief executive officer severance agreement totaling $1.4 million on March 20, 2003. There are no future payments due Mr. Thompson.    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001  Revenues                                                         Change                                     2002	2001	   Amount       %        Comment                                    ------      ------      ------     ------     ------            Business segment: 	Gaming operations	 $ 43,859    $ 44,805     $  (946)     (2.1)%      1 	Product sales	           58,729      53,356	    5,373      10.1 %      2                                   -------     -------     ------- 	Total revenues	         $102,588    $ 98,161	  $ 4,427	4.5 %                                  ========    ========     =======   Percentage of total revenues: 	Gaming operations	    42.8%	45.6% 	Product sales	            57.2%	54.4%                                    -----       ----- 	Total	                   100.0%      100.0%                                    =====       =====  1.	Gaming operations' revenues during the year ended December 31, 2002 were $43.9 million, a decrease of approximately $0.9 million, or 2%, from revenues of $44.8 million in the 2001 comparable period.  This net decrease resulted from:  (i)	a decrease in recurring revenues from leased slot machines 	of approximately $0.3 million in 2002, from approximately $27.6 	million in the prior year, to approximately $27.3 million in the 	current year as increases in revenues from branded slot machines 	and licensed games were offset by a decrease in revenues from 	non-branded games.  The improvement in branded slot machine 	revenue was attributable to an 8% increase in the average number 	of branded slot machines leased to customers to approximately 	2,530 for the year ended December 31, 2002 from approximately 	2,340 in the prior year, partially offset by an approximate 6% 	reduction in the average net win per day per branded slot 	machine, from approximately $28 during 2001 to approximately $26 	during 2002.  Management believes that a slight change in the 	demographics of slot machine placements, whereby more slot 	machines were located in jurisdictions with historically lower 	win per day amounts, contributed to the decline in the average 	win per day. Non-branded slot machines accounted for $2.7 million 	of revenues in 2002 as compared to approximately $3.8 million in 	2001.  Average non-branded machines outstanding during the year 	were approximately 410 and 450 for 2002 and 2001, respectively. 	Additionally, the Company received approximately $0.3 million in 	2002 from the participation in an average of 200 licensed games 	for which the Company does not provide hardware for the games. 	The Company intends to continue the acquisition of leasing 	arrangements whereby the Company would supply the software 	component to a third party which would use hardware not otherwise 	owned or leased by the Company. These games earned the Company 	approximately $8 per day and did not exist in the prior year.  At 	December 31, 2002, the Company maintained 2,380, 394 and 332 	branded, non-branded and licensed games without hardware, 	respectively.  At December 31, 2001, the Company maintained 	2,679, 415 and 0 branded, non-branded and licensed games without 	hardware, respectively, and  (ii)	a decrease of approximately $0.7 million in table games 	revenues. This decrease was caused primarily by a decline in the 	number of outstanding tables and in the average monthly lease 	revenue in domestic markets offset, in part, by the exclusion for 	approximately ten months of table game revenues from the 	Company's Australian subsidiary which, until November 2001, was a 	50% owned subsidiary whose table games revenues were excluded 	from the consolidated results.  For the year ended December 31, 	2002, revenues from European and domestically leased casino table 	games were approximately $15.3 million compared with 	approximately $17.1 million in 2001.  Management believes that 	the industry trend to reduce the number of table games in casinos 	in the last several years in favor of slot machines, as well as 	increased competition from competitors selling "felt" only table 	games, have contributed to this decline in table game placements 	and revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, 	the Company averaged approximately 1,090, which includes the 	table games in Australia, and 1,040 leased casino table games,    	respectively. The average monthly lease revenue was approximately 	$1,200 during 2002 compared to approximately $1,280 during 2001. 	The monthly lease revenue includes royalties and commencement 	fees paid during the respective years.  Management believes that 	the decline in the average monthly lease charge in 2002 was 	attributable to the absence of table commencement fee revenues in 	2002, lower royalty payments received, and a lower percentage of 	the higher revenue generating progressive table games in 2002. 	The decrease in revenues was partially offset by gross revenues 	from table games operations in Australia in 2002 that were not 	consolidated in the Company's 2001 financial statements as the 	Australian subsidiary was a 50% owned, unconsolidated subsidiary 	until November 15, 2001.  During the year ended December 31, 	2002, the Australian subsidiary was a wholly-owned subsidiary, 	and it generated table game revenues of approximately $1.2 	million compared to revenues of $0.1 million from November 15 to 	December 31, 2001. The Company maintained 1,067 and 1,134 table 	games at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  2.	Product sales' revenues during the year ended December 31, 2002 were $58.7 million, an increase of approximately $5.4 million, or 10%, from revenues of $53.3 million in the 2001 comparable period.  This increase during 2002 was due principally to:  (i)	the inclusion of revenues from the Company's Australian 	subsidiary in 2002 that were not included with the Company's 2001 	consolidated financial results of approximately $7.5 million. 	The majority of this subsidiary's revenues were excluded from the 	2001 consolidated revenues, as the subsidiary was a 50% owned 	non-consolidated subsidiary until November 15, 2001.  During the 	year ended December 31, 2002, the Australian subsidiary was a 	wholly-owned subsidiary.  Offsetting this increase in the current 	year was a decline in interior signage and visual display 	products of approximately $1.8 million from the exclusion of the 	Company's Latin American subsidiary revenues in 2002 due to this 	subsidiary becoming a non-consolidated reporting business 	beginning October 1, 2001. Additionally, the Company experienced 	a decline in European and domestic sales of its interior sign 	products and visual display products of approximately $2.9 	increase in service and installation revenues of approximately 	$1.0 million, and  (ii)	an increase of approximately $2.4 million in revenues from 	the Company's systems business operations.  Increased sales to 	certain Canadian customers which expanded casino slot operations 	during the year, as well as new customer installations in Europe 	related to the growth and expansion of casinos, were the primary 	contributor to this increase.

Gaming operations' operating income during the year ended December 31, 2002 was $7.9 million compared to operating income of $15.7 million in 2001.  This net decrease of approximately $7.8 million was primarily due to:  (i)	the previously discussed decrease in recurring revenues 	from leased slot machines of approximately $0.3 million and an 	increase in the costs to service, refurbish and maintain the slot 	machine route.  The cost to service, refurbish and maintain the 	slot route increased to approximately $8.8 million in the current 	year as compared to approximately $5.7 million in the prior year. 	Factors which caused this increase included significant 	refurbishment costs to a non-branded product involving signs, 	electronics and slot machine tracking, refurbishment costs to 	existing slot machines for a new product theme involving 	customized features, conversion costs in changing out previously 	themed games to new game themes, and the normal costs associated 	with maintaining older slot machines which are no longer under a 	warranty period and typically require increased repair and 	maintenance.  Slot rental expense increased to $5.5 million in 	2002 as compared to $4.1 million in 2001.  Depreciation and 	amortization for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 	$6.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The increase was due 	primarily to the increase in total slot route equipment during 	2002 combined with an acceleration of depreciation in respect to 	certain signage and slot machines in 2002. The Company also 	incurred segment expenses, excluding slot rent expense and 	depreciation and amortization expense, of approximately $7.8 	million in 2002 compared to approximately $5.1 million in 2001. 	This $2.7 million increase was caused by a charge for bad debts 	of $1.5 million. The remaining $1.2 million increase was caused 	principally by increased sales and engineering expenses related 	to the development and introduction of new game themes and 	certain charges for stock options issued to consultants, and  (ii)	an improvement in operating income of approximately $1.3 	million from leased casino table games due primarily to a decline 	in segment expenses and a decrease in depreciation and 	amortization, partially offset by the previously discussed 	decrease in recurring revenues of $0.7 million and an increase in 	costs of revenues. Costs of revenues as a percentage of revenues 	increased to 21% in 2002 from 13% in 2001.  This occurred as the 	Company refurbished many of its older table games during 2002, 	incurring both increased repair costs and personnel expenses to 	complete the refurbishments. Total costs of revenues, exclusive 	of segment expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled 	approximately $3.4 million compared to approximately $2.2 million 	in 2001. Depreciation and amortization for the years ended 	December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $1.4 million and $2.6 million, 	respectively. The decrease was due primarily to the curtailment 	in the amortization of certain goodwill and intangible assets due 	to the implementation of SFAS No. 142 beginning in January 2002. 	Segment expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were 	approximately $2.0 million in 2002 as compared with $4.0 million 	in 2001. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the 	provision for bad debts of $1.5 million as well as decreases in 	personnel and related expenses and in sales and engineering 	costs.  2.	Product sales' operating income during the year ended December 31, 2002 was $2.6 million, compared to operating income of $4.9 million in 2001.  This decline of approximately $2.3 million in operating income resulted principally from:  (i)	lower gross profit margins from the Company's interior 	signs, electronics and other product sales of approximately 36% 	in 2001 to 30% in 2002.  This decline was caused principally by 	an increased provision for obsolete inventories in the year ended 	December 31, 2002 to approximately $3.7 million as compared to 	provisions for obsolescence in 2001 of approximately $1.1 million 	and lower gross profit margins on certain installation contracts, 	certain of which were outsourced and generated negative gross 	profit in 2002.  Additionally, segment expenses, before 	depreciation and impairment or restructuring charges, increased 	approximately $1.9 million primarily due to an increase in the 	provision for bad debts of approximately $1.9 million in 2002 	relating principally to a receivable from the Company's former 	50% owned subsidiary in Latin America.   Depreciation and 	amortization for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 	$0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. This slight decrease 	was due primarily to the curtailment in the amortization of 	certain goodwill and intangible assets due to the implementation 	of SFAS No. 142 beginning January 2002.  These factors were 	offset, in part, by the aforementioned increase in revenues 	during 2002, and     (ii)   an improvement in operating results of the Company's systems 	business of approximately $1.5 million, due primarily to the 	aforementioned increase in revenues of $2.4 million. Gross profit 	margins for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 remained 	relatively constant at 51% for both periods. Segment expenses, 	excluding costs of sales, impairment or restructuring expense and 	depreciation and amortization expenses, decreased from $4.0 	million in 2001 to approximately $3.8 million in 2002.  Decreases 	in research and development costs related to certain new systems 	product development in 2002 contributed to the decrease in 	segment expenses. Depreciation and amortization for the years 	ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $0.1 million for both 	periods.  3.	Corporate expenses during the year ended December 31, 2002 were $12.9 million, a slight increase compared to $12.8 million in 2001. This increase occurred principally from increases in marketing expenses and legal and compliance expenses, partially offset by the reduction in the Company's permanent work force as part of the restructuring plan in August 2002.  4.	Depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2002 was approximately $12.5 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 3%, from approximately $12.1 million in 2001. This increase was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in depreciation related to slot machines, partially offset by the aforementioned decreases in amortization related to both table games and interior signs and electronics.  Interest Expense      Interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2002 was $15.7 million, an increase of $4.0 million, or 34%, from $11.7 million in 2001. This increase was due to higher average outstanding borrowings during 2002 and a higher average effective interest rate during 2002 of approximately 14% compared to approximately 10% in 2001. In August 2001, the Company refinanced its debt structure and incurred an additional $18 million of long-term debt at a higher interest rate.  Loss from Discontinued Operations      During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded losses from discontinued operations, net of income tax benefits calculated at a 34% tax rate, of approximately $2.0 million compared to a loss of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. The losses relate to the Company's exterior sign operation, which was sold effective October 31, 2002.  The decision to sell this operation was made in August 2002.  Other Income and Expense      Other income and expense, excluding interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2002 was a net expense of $0.3 million compared to net income the year ended December 31, 2001 of $1.0 million.  The decrease from the prior year's income to the current year's net expense was caused principally from the recognition of a net gain from the sale of 50% of the Company's Australian subsidiary of approximately $1.3 million which was completed by the delivery of a wide area progressive system during the third quarter of 2001.      Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $0.7 million compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.  Income Tax Provision      During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a tax provision of $1.5 million compared to a provision of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.  The primary component of the income tax provisions was an offset to a tax benefit recorded relative to discontinued operations losses. The tax provision offsets the tax benefit of the losses from discontinued operations for both periods. No tax benefit was recorded by the Company related to its loss from continuing operations, as the benefit would have been fully reserved.    Loss Per Share      Both basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $2.95 on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 12,843,000. Both basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $0.83 on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 11,750,000. Stock options have not been included in the computations of diluted net loss per share as their effect would be antidilutive.

Gaming operations' revenues in 2001 were $44.8 million, a $9.6 million increase from revenues of $35.2 million in 2000. This 27.4% increase resulted from:  (i)	an increase in recurring revenues from leased slot machines of 	approximately $12.8 million in the 2001 period attributable to the 	addition of approximately 1,200 average branded units in operation 	and an increase in the average win per day per branded slot machine 	from approximately $25 during the prior year to approximately $28 	during the current year. This increase was partially offset by a 	decrease in revenue from non-branded slot machines to $3.8 million 	during 2001 from $4.8 million during 2000.  At December 31, 2001, 	the Company had 2,679 branded slot machines and 421 non-branded slot 	machines on lease as compared to 2,009 and 477 at December 31, 2000, 	and  (ii)	a decrease of approximately $3.1 million in table games revenues 	reflecting the absence of a nonrecurring sale of certain video and 	internet license rights of $2.6 million which occurred in 2000 and a 	slight decrease in the average monthly lease payment on leased table 	games during 2001. At December 31, 2001, the Company maintained 	1,134 table games compared to 1,025 at December 31, 2000.  2.	Product sales' revenues in 2001 were $53.3 million as compared to revenues of $50.2 million in 2000, an increase of approximately $3.1 million, or 6.2%. This increase during 2001 was due principally to:  (i)	an increase in product revenues of $1.8 million due primarily to 	an increase of $5.0 million in electronic display products, 	partially offset by a decline in interior visual display products of 	approximately $3.4 million, and  (ii)	an increase in systems revenues of approximately $1.3 million due 	primarily to an increase in international revenues.

Gaming operations' operating income in 2001 increased to $15.7 million from $14.6 million in 2000. This increase of approximately $1.1 million, or 7.7%, was primarily due to:  (i)	the aforementioned increase in revenues of leased slot machines 	of $12.8 million offset, in part, by an increase in depreciation and 	rent expense of approximately $4.8 million in 2001. These increases 	during the 2001 period were the result of the significant growth in 	placements of branded slot machines in the Company's route 	operation, from an average of approximately 1,100 machines in 2000 	to approximately 2,300 in 2001 and, beginning in the latter part of 	2000, the use of operating leases to finance the purchase and 	placement of the machines. Segment expenses, excluding slot rent 	expense and depreciation expense, increased from $3.4 million in 	2000 to $5.1 million in 2001. The increase was due primarily to an 	increase in the cost to service the route due to the aforementioned 	increase in placements of branded slot machines, and,  (ii)	the aforementioned decrease in revenues from leased table games 	of $3.1 million and an increase in the costs of revenues offset, in 	part, by a decline in segment expenses, exclusive of depreciation 	and amortization. Costs of revenues as a percentage of revenues 	increased to 13% in the current period from 9% in the prior period. 	Total costs of revenues, exclusive of segment expenses, for the year 	ended December 31, 2001 totaled approximately $2.2 million compared 	to approximately $1.7 million in 2000.  Depreciation and 	amortization for the years ended December 30, 2001 and 2000 was $2.6 	million and $2.5 million, respectively. Segment expenses, excluding 	depreciation and amortization, were approximately $4.0 million in 	2001 period as compared with $3.4 million in 2000.  The increase was 	primarily due to an increase in the bad debt provision, partially 	offset by a decrease in personnel and related costs.  2.	Product sales' operating income for 2001 was $4.9 million compared to an operating loss of $0.6 in 2000. This improvement in operating income of approximately $5.5 million resulted from:  (i)	the aforementioned increase in interior signage and visual 	display products revenues of $1.3 million and an improvement in the 	gross profit percentage from 30% in 2000 to 36% in 2001. This gross 	margin improvement was primarily the result of (a) an approximate 	$1.2 million margin reduction in 2000 caused by start up costs 	related to a new LED product, (b) reduced provisions for inventory 	obsolescence of approximately $2.1 million in 2001 and (c) a shift 	in the product sales mix. In 2001, the Company had a greater 	percentage of higher margin electronic displays sold versus 2000 and 	a lower percentage of lower margin interior sign displays sold. 	Additionally, segment expenses, before depreciation and 	amortization, decreased approximately $1.6 million to $10.2 million 	in the current period from $11.8 in the prior period. The decrease 	was due primarily to the decrease in the provision for bad debts in 	2001 from 2000. Depreciation and amortization for the years ended 	December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately $1.0 million and $1.2 	million, respectively, and    (ii)	the aforementioned increase in systems sales revenues of $1.3 	million. Gross profit margins increased to 51% for the year ended 	December 31, 2002 from 42% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The 	gross profit margin improvement was due primarily to an increase in 	sales of higher margin system components. Segment expenses, 	excluding depreciation and amortization expenses, increased from 	approximately $3.4 million in 2000 to approximately $4.0 million in 	2001.  Increases in development costs related to certain new systems 	product development and international costs during 2001 contributed 	to the increase in segment expenses. Depreciation and amortization 	for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 remained constant at 	approximately  $0.1 million.  3.	Corporate expenses in 2001 decreased by approximately $1.1 million from $13.9 million in 2000 to $12.8 million in 2001. This decrease was due to a decline in marketing expenses due to reduced trade show expenses and promotional costs as well as a decline in administrative incentive compensation.  4.	Depreciation and amortization in 2001 increased by $1.3 million, or 12%, from $10.8 million in 2000 to $12.1 million in 2001. This increase was primarily due to a significant increase in the average number of leased slot machines in service from 2000 to 2001 of approximately 1,200 machines.  Interest Expense      Interest expense in 2001 was $11.7 million compared to $10.5 million in 2000.  This increase of  approximately $1.2 million, or 10%, was due to higher average outstanding borrowings in 2001 of approximately $7.0 million, due principally to the Company's refinancing in August 2001, as well as a slightly higher average effective interest rate in 2001.  Loss On Early Retirement of Debt      In connection with the Company's August 2001 refinancing and early retirement of certain of its outstanding debt obligations (see Liquidity and Capital Resources, below), the Company incurred a loss for the early retirement of debt, totaling approximately $3.1 million, during the year ended December 31, 2001.  Other Income and Expense      Other income and expense, excluding interest income, in 2001 was net income of $1.0 million compared to a net expense in 2000 of $0.6 million, an increase of approximately $1.6 million. This increase was principally due to the recognition of a net gain of $1.3 million on the sale of a 50% interest in the Company's Australian subsidiary and systems sale.      Interest income remained constant at approximately $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 as an increase in average cash and cash equivalent balances during the latter part of 2001 resulting from the net cash proceeds of the Company's refinancing in August 2001 was offset by lower interest rates earned on cash deposits in 2001 and a decrease in interest income recorded from interest-bearing notes as certain charges have been deferred in 2001 pending cash receipt.  Income Tax Provision      During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a tax provision of approximately $0.8 million compared to a provision of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.  The primary component of the income tax provisions was an offset to a tax benefit recorded relative to discontinued operations losses. The tax provision offsets the tax benefit of losses from the discontinued operations for both periods. No tax benefit was recorded by the Company related to its loss from continuing operations, as the benefit would have been fully reserved.  Loss from Discontinued Operations  During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded losses from discontinued operations, net of    income tax benefits calculated at a 34% tax rate, of approximately $1.6 million, compared to a loss of approximately $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2000.  The losses relate to the Company's exterior sign operations, which was sold effective October 31, 2002.  The decision to sell this operation was made in August 2002.  Loss Per Share      Both basic and diluted loss per share for 2001 were $0.83 on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of 11,750,000. Both basic and diluted loss per share for 2000 were $2.02 on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of 10,968,000.  Stock options have not been included in the computations of diluted net loss per share as their effect would be antidilutive.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      For the year ended December 30, 2002, the Company incurred a net loss of $37.9 million.  Net cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2002 were $16.3 million, an increase of approximately $1.1 million from $15.2 million at December 31, 2001. Working capital decreased to $22.0 million at December 31, 2002 from $39.2 million at December 31, 2001. This working capital decrease was due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable and installment sales receivable of approximately $4.5 million and inventory of approximately $5.4 million, principally related to write-downs and charges from the restructuring plan, an increase in accrued liabilities of approximately $1.9 million, principally from accrued severance costs for separated officers, a decrease in deferred tax assets of $1.9 million that were reclassified to non-current deferred tax liabilities and a net decrease in assets and liabilities under disposal group of $3.6 million as a result of the Company's sale of its exterior sign operation.      Cash provided by operating activities was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.  The significant items affecting this amount were a net loss of $37.9 million offset by non-cash charges of: (i) $17.1 million for asset impairments, loss from discontinued operations and valuation provisions, (ii) $12.5 million for depreciation and amortization and (iii) $2.2 million for amortization of debt discount. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities also affecting cash provided by operating activities were increases in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, principally from accrued severance costs for separated officers and an accrual for long- term lease commitments, and a net decrease in accounts receivable and installment sales receivable of approximately $2.0 million, partially offset by a net increase in inventories of approximately $3.7 million and a decrease in accounts payable of approximately $1.2 million.      Cash provided by investing activities was $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, due primarily to cash provided by the divesture of the exterior sign operations of $2.6 million and sales of property and equipment of $1.8 million, partially offset by an increase in intangible assets of approximately $1.0 million and purchases of property and equipment of approximately $1.0 million.      Cash used in financing activities was $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily the result of principal payments on debt, deferred license fees and capital leases of approximately $2.9 million offset, in part, by proceeds of approximately $0.7 million from the issuance of common stock.      On August 22, 2001, the Company completed the private placement of $105.0 million of its 11.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2008 and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 420,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $7.70 per share.  Interest payments of approximately $6.2 million are due on May 1 and November 1 until 2008. The Senior Secured Notes due 2008 are secured by a security interest in certain of the Company's assets and certain assets of its subsidiaries. On or after August 15, 2005, the Company will have the right to redeem all or some of the notes at a price that will decrease over time from 105.938% of the principal amount in 2005 to 100.0% of the principal amount in 2007, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Senior Secured Notes due 2008 include a covenant whereby the Company may only purchase additional slot machines if it maintains $5.0 million of available liquidity, as defined. The Company is in compliance with this covenant as of December 31, 2002.      Following each fiscal year, if the Company has excess cash flow for such fiscal year, the Company will offer to purchase up to an aggregate principal amount of notes equal to 50.0% of such excess cash flow at a price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.        In February 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of a $17.5 million working capital revolving line of credit facility (the "Facility") with Foothill Capital Corporation ("Foothill").  Borrowings under the Facility are based on (i) eligible accounts receivable, as defined, up to $7.5 million with interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% or prime plus 0.75% and (ii) Table Game EBITDA, as defined, up to $10.0 million with interest at prime plus a range of 2.0% to 3.5% depending on Debt Coverage Ratios, as defined in the Facility.  Any borrowings under the Facility are secured by a first secured interest in substantially all of the Company's assets.  The Company pays a 0.5% per annum unused line fee.  The Facility has early payoff penalties during the term of the line at 3.0% during the first year, 2.0% during the second year, and 1.0% during the third year. The Facility has an initial term of three years and includes certain restrictive financial covenants, including maintenance of $20.0 million of annual EBITDA, minimum table games revenue of $0.75 million monthly and a table game installed base of not less than 600 games.  At June 30 and September 30, 2002, the Company was not in compliance with its covenant to maintain minimum amounts of annual EBITDA. The Company and Foothill subsequently amended the EBITDA covenant to require the Company to maintain a trailing twelve months EBITDA of $15.0 million for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2002, December 31, 2002, and March 31, 2003. The calculation of EBITDA was also amended to allow for certain non-cash charges to be excluded. The EBITDA covenant increases to $17.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, and increases to the original amount of $20.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, and each quarter thereafter for the remaining term of the Facility.  The capacity of the Facility will be $12.5 million until the Company has achieved EBITDA of $20.0 million for three consecutive quarters, at which point the capacity of the Facility will revert to the original $17.5 million. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants associated with the Facility.      Based on the amount of cash and cash equivalents held of approximately $16.3 million, cash generated from operations and credit available under its Facility with Foothill, management believes the Company has sufficient working capital on both a short- and long-term basis.      A lease agreement for a building in Las Vegas, NV contains a minimum net worth requirement stating that if the net worth of the Company falls below a specified threshold, the Company must provide the landlord with a letter of credit to secure future rent payments. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, the Company's minimum net worth did not meet the requirements under the lease agreement. Because of the violations, the Company paid $0.8 million for a letter of credit to secure future rent payments and potentially could be obligated to purchase an additional $2.2 million letter of credit.      The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations for long-term debt, capital leases, operating leases, license fees, slot machine purchases and employment agreements for the periods shown:    	                                          Less than       1-3         4-5        After 5     (Amounts in thousands)	       Total       1 year        years       years        years                                        -----       ------        -----       -----        -----            Contractual Obligations 	Long-term debt	             $105,579     $    144     $    151	    $    284     $105,000 	Capital lease obligations	2,137	     1,509	    625	           3	        - 	Operating leases	       29,371	     9,031	  6,577	       4,360	    9,403  	License fees	                  902          451          451	           -	        - 	Purchase of slot machines         600          600            -            -            - 	Employment agreements	        6,391	     2,247	  3,054	       1,090	        -                                       -------      -------      -------      -------      -------           Total	                     $144,980	  $ 13,982     $ 10,858	    $  5,737	 $114,403                                      ========     ========     ========     ========     ========       The table above includes accretion of debt discount of $4.7 million for the periods shown.  Capital Expenditures and Other      During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company spent approximately $1.0 million for purchases of property and equipment. The Company presently plans to spend approximately $3.0 million for property and equipment for the year ending December 31, 2003.  The Company plans to purchase inventory for lease to others only to the extent that specific machines not currently on lease or participation at casinos are used or based on contractual commitments with the supplier of its gaming machines. Purchases of property and equipment are limited to $6.0 million under the terms of the Company's Facility.        In March 2002, the Company entered into a contractual commitment to purchase a minimum of 125 slot machines each calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003 for a new slot machine introduction. These purchases will total approximately $3.5 million. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has not purchased any slot machines under this agreement and may be obligated to pay a cancellation fee of up to $0.6 million. In March 2003, the Company paid $0.3 million to the supplier to be used as an advance against future slot machine purchases or as part of the cancellation fee.      In October 2002, the Company entered into a development and licensing agreement with Aristocrat whereby Aristocrat will be an exclusive supplier of hardware for our branded slot machine products in certain North America jurisdictions. Under the agreement, we will be responsible for game development and theme licensing and Aristocrat will integrate the games onto its latest game platforms. In January 2003, this agreement was expanded to allow us to outsource our servicing, maintenance and refurbishing requirements to Aristocrat, so we may focus our efforts on game development, including game conceptualization, art and software program design. Aristocrat will receive royalties for service and hardware rendered per game per day. On a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, we plan to replace our existing slot machines placed in casinos with Aristocrat versions of these machines.      The Company is a party to post-employment agreements entered into in August 2002 with its former CEO and CFO. The agreements require payments subsequent to December 31, 2002 of approximately $2.0 million plus medical costs through August 2006. In March 2003, the Company reached an agreement with its former CEO whereby he resigned from the Company's board of directors and specifically as chairman of the board. In March 2003, the Company paid its former CEO all outstanding future payments, according to the chief executive officer severance agreement, totaling approximately $1.4 million and agreed to pay certain legal costs incurred by the former CEO in the approximate amount of $0.4 million.      Presently, the Company owns or leases approximately 800 machines which are not currently in use at casinos.  Due to the number of slot machines owned or leased by the Company which are not currently in use at casinos as well as the new agreement with Aristocrat, planned purchases for slot machines (inventory leased to others) for 2003 should be significantly less than in previous years.      A former supplier to the Company has alleged that the Company has an outstanding commitment to purchase certain electronic components in the amount of approximately $0.5 million.  The Company does not believe that the amount or the alleged contractual relationship are valid and does not plan to acquire the components.      In April 2002, the Company acquired certain rights to develop software from its primary supplier of slot machines in exchange for an advance payment on royalties.  The advance royalty payment made by the Company in April 2002 was approximately $1.6 million. At December 31, 2002, the amount of the advance royalty payable was approximately $1.1 million.  Share Repurchase Plan      On August 13, 2002 the Company's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $2.0 million of the Company's common stock. The purchases will be made from time to time in the open market. The timing and actual number of shares to be purchased will depend on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company purchased approximately 76,000 shares at an average price of $2.94. Additionally, the Company acquired 100,000 shares as the result of foreclosures or forfeitures on obligations owed to the Company which were secured by the shares.  As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 195,000 shares of common stock held in treasury.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES      Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant estimates, judgments and assumptions, that we believe are reasonable, in calculating the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our    observance of know industry trends, and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. On a regular basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to lives assigned to our assets, the determination of bad debts, inventory valuation reserves, asset impairment and self-insurance reserves. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates.      We have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations: revenue recognition, receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories and obsolescence, and long-lived asset impairment. To provide an understanding of the methodology we apply to these and other significant accounting policies are discussed below and where appropriate in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.  Revenue Recognition      The Company recognizes revenue depending on the line of business as follows:      Product sales are executed by a signed contract or customer purchase order. Revenue is recognized when the completed product is delivered.  If the agreement calls for Mikohn to perform an installation after delivery, revenue related to the installation is recognized when the installation has been completed and accepted by the customer.      System sales consist of a suite of products (some of which are sold separately) that enable gaming entities to track customer gaming activity, account for slot machine activity and operate progressive jackpot systems. There are proprietary hardware and software components to the systems.  The Company accounts for system sales in accordance with Statement of Position 97- 2 - Software Revenue Recognition ("SOP 97-2").  System sales are considered multiple element arrangements because they include hardware, software, installation, training and post-sale customer support.  System sales are evidenced by a signed contract.  Follow-up spare parts and hardware-only sales are evidenced by a purchase order.  Revenue for system sales is recognized when: (i) there is a signed contract with a fixed determinable price; (ii) collectibility of the sale is probable; and (iii) the hardware and software have been delivered, installed, training has been completed and acceptance has occurred. Not all systems contracts require installation.  Examples include sales of hardware only to (i) previous customers that are expanding their systems, (ii) customers that have multiple locations and do the installation themselves and require an additional software license and hardware and (iii) customers purchasing spare parts.      Maintenance and support are sold under agreements with established vendor- specific objective evidence of price.  These contracts are generally for a period of 12 months and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract service period. Further training is also sold under agreements with established vendor-specific objective evidence of price, which is based on daily rates and is recognized upon delivery.      The leasing of proprietary table games to casino customers occurs under signed lease agreements. Table game lease contracts are typically for a 36- month period with a 30-day cancellation clause.  The lease revenue is recognized on a monthly basis.      The leasing of proprietary slot machines occurs under signed lease agreements. These contracts will either be on participation or a fixed-rental basis.  Slot machine lease contracts are typically for a month-to-month period with a 30-day cancellation clause. On a participation basis, the Company earns a share of the revenue that the casino earns from these slot machines.  On a fixed-rental basis, the Company charges a fixed amount per slot machine per day.  Revenues from both types of lease arrangements are recognized on the accrual basis.  Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts      We regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors. When a customer's account becomes past due, we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause. If it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing, deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business, we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available. We also record reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with    individual customers. If circumstances related to specific customers change, our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change.  Inventory and Obsolescence      We regularly evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, estimated service period, product end of life dates, estimated current and future market values, service inventory requirements and new product introductions, as well as other factors. Purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure. Raw materials and work in progress with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed at least quarterly by our engineering and operating personnel for obsolescence. Such raw material and work in progress write-downs are typically caused by engineering change orders or product end of life adjustments. Finished goods are reviewed at least quarterly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices. Service inventory is systematically reserved for based on the estimated remaining service life of the inventory. We record reserves for inventory based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand in our analysis. If circumstances related to our inventories change, our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change.  Long-Lived Asset Impairment      Long-lived assets and intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment quarterly or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." We evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expected the assets to generate. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources in the future, which could result in an impairment of long lived assets.      For indefinite lived assets including perpetual licenses and goodwill, an independent valuation is performed at least annually to determine if any impairment has occurred.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS      In September 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees.  Statement No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2002. Management does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on the Company.      In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 145, "Rescission of Statement Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections". Among other things, Statement No. 145 rescinds various pronouncements regarding early extinguishment of debt and allows extraordinary accounting treatment for early extinguishment only when the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" are met. Statement No. 145 provisions regarding early extinguishment of debt are generally effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Management adopted Statement No. 145, and the impact was a reclassification of approximately $3.1 million from an extraordinary item to an other income and expense of a loss from the early retirement of debt during 2001.      In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities", which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs.  Statement No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3.  The Company will adopt the    provisions of Statement No. 146 for restructuring activities initiated after December 31, 2002.  Statement No. 146 requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.  Under EITF 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of a company's commitment to an exit plan.  Statement No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. Accordingly, Statement No. 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amount recognized.      In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure", which amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock- Based Compensation". Statement No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, Statement No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements of the effects of stock-based compensation. The transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of Statement No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The adoption of Statement No. 148 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet or results of operations. The Company will provide the interim disclosures required by Statement No. 148 beginning in the first quarter of 2003 and has provided the required annual disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.      In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others," which disclosures are effective for financial statements issued after December 15, 2002.  While the Company has various guarantees included in contracts in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of indemnities, these guarantees would only result in immaterial increases in future costs, but do not represent significant or contingent liabilities of the indebtedness of others.      In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which requires the consolidation of variable interests entities, as defined. FIN 46 is applicable to financial statements issued after 2002, however, disclosures are required currently if the Company expects to consolidate any variable interests entities. The Company does not expect to identify any variable interest entities that must be consolidated, but may be required to make additional disclosures. The maximum exposure of any investment that may be determined to be in a variable interest entity is limited to the amount invested.  Item 7A.	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  MARKET RISK  Foreign Currency Risk  There are two types of foreign currency exchange risks that a company may be subject to: transaction and translation gains or losses. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are distinguished from translation gains or losses as follows: (i) translation adjustments do not involve the movement of cash, they are accounting conversion    calculations of an existing functional currency to a reporting currency and (ii) transaction gain or losses, however, are based on an actual transaction that requires formal payment at a future point in time.      We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk relating to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' asset, liability, income and expense accounts. Our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at the end of the period. The income and expense accounts are translated using the average rate of exchange during the period. Due to the long-term nature of our investment in our foreign operations, 60% of our intercompany translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component in stockholders' equity, and the remaining amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. Although we do not regularly incur gains or losses from specific foreign currency transactions and do not believe that these amounts would be material, these gains and losses would be reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not have any forwards, options or other derivative contracts in force. We do not consider our existing foreign currency translation exposure to be material.  Interest Rate Risk  We have total interest-bearing debt of approximately $108.0 million before discounts. The components of this amount have fixed rates of interest and therefore, we do not have exposure to the fluctuation of market interest rates. However, in February 2002, we acquired a $17.5 million revolving line of credit which bears floating rate interest on outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2002, we had not made any borrowings under this line of credit. Any future borrowings will be exposed to market rate risk. We periodically review our interest rate exposure, if any, on our long-term debt and, as market conditions warrant, we may enter into an interest rate cap or swap agreements in order to manage this exposure. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not have any agreements in force. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    Item 8.
