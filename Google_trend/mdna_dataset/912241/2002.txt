Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and           Results of Operations   GENERAL    All amounts (including dollar amounts and number of shares) reported in this section (from this point forward) are expressed in thousands and are rounded to the nearest thousand unless otherwise stated. However, numbers of units are expressed in whole amounts.  All percentages reported are based on those rounded numbers.  See Note 19 - Segment Reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   YEAR-END ASSET VALUATION AND CHARGES    Subsequent to the events of September 11, 2001, the impact of which was felt throughout the worldwide economy, and based on the current economic and business environment relative to financial reporting practices, the Company performed a detailed, comprehensive review of its balance sheet relative to the changed economic and business environment conditions.  Specifically identified during this review, management analyzed goodwill assets for impairment, slow moving, excess or obsolete inventories, customer debts in light of changing economic conditions and other miscellaneous assets.    This review and analysis resulted in the Company taking various charges in its fourth quarter for (i) impaired assets (principally goodwill and nonoperating fixed assets of approximately $2,900 included in the "Write off of Assets and Other" and "Impairment Loss" captions), (ii) receivables, including significant amounts owed from debtors who purchased certain patent and internet rights, for which collectibility is now considered doubtful (approximately $2,800 which is included in the operating income segments below), (iii) inventory reserves, including those related to the energy crisis and the economic decline (approximately $2,200 included in the operating income segments below), (iv) losses incurred in foreign operations due to the collapse of the Argentina economy and softness in the Australasian market (approximately $600 included in revenues below) and (v) miscellaneous charges related to medical insurance claims and certain international slot leasing revenues of $1,000 (included in operating income segments below).   ACQUISITION / DIVESTITURE OF SUBSIDIARIES    In October 2001, the Company completed the sale of 50% of its interest in Mikohn Latin America S.A. Certain officers and management of Mikohn Latin America, through RLP Holdings, purchased a 50% interest for approximately $400 in cash and a $100 note.  The Company accounts for the financial results of this entity using the equity method since October 2001.  Equity in earnings and losses of the unconsolidated subsidiary is now charged to revenues on a monthly basis with a corresponding charge to the Company's investment in subsidiary account.  Prior to the 50% divestiture, the financial results of Mikohn Latin America were included in the consolidated results of operations.  Through September 30, 2001, Mikohn Latin America accounted for approximately $2,200 in revenues, $900 in gross profit, and net income of approximately $100 and these amounts are included in the financial analysis below.  From October to December 2001, approximately $297 of equity in losses of affiliates is included in product sales revenues below.    On November 15, 2001, the Company converted $518 of debt owing from Mikohn Gaming Australasia Pty., Ltd ("MGA") into 20,000 shares of MGA, thereby increasing our ownership from 50% to approximately 93%.  Previous to this transaction, the Company had accounted for this unconsolidated subsidiary using the equity method whereby the Company would record a 50% share of earnings or losses of this subsidiary.  Subsequent to this transaction, the Company now consolidates all accounts of this subsidiary into its consolidated financial statements.  From January 1, 2001 to November 15, 2001, approximately $700 was charged to product sales revenues below for the equity in losses of this unconsolidated subsidiary.   For the period November 15, 2001 to December 31, 2001, MGA accounted                                         23   for approximately $1,000 in revenues, $250 in gross profit and $400 in net loss. These amounts are included in the financial analysis below.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    During 2001, the Company entered into various material transactions with related parties. Specifically, the Company sold approximately $280 of products to its 50% owned affiliate in Latin America subsequent to the Company's divestiture of 50% of this subsidiary on October 1, 2001. Additionally, the Company charged its Latin American affiliate approximately $36 in interest expense. The Company also had significant transactions with its Australian affiliate from prior to the Australian affiliate being consolidated with the Company on November 15, 2001. Specifically, the Company charged its Australian affiliate $172 in interest charges, $213 in royalty fees relating to electronic sales, charges for table games of $465, and $194 in net sales of various products. Approximately $600 of net costs were charged from the Australian affiliate to the Company for various costs from January 1, 2001 to November 15, 2001. All sales and expense charges to or from affiliates were deemed be arms- length transactions.                                          24   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000  REVENUES                                                          Change                                                         ------ Business segment:           2001         2000      Amount     %      Comment - -----------------           ----         ----      ------     --     -------  Gaming operations         $ 44,074     $ 34,796    $ 9,278   26.7%      1 Product sales               66,983       65,970      1,013    1.5%      2                           --------     --------    -------            Total revenues  $111,057     $100,766    $10,291   10.2%                           ========     ========    =======  Percentage of total      revenues:      Gaming operations        39.7%        34.5%      Product sales            60.3%        65.5%                           --------     --------           Total              100.0%       100.0%                           ========     ========  1.  Gaming operations revenues in 2001 were $44,074, a $9,278 increase from     $34,796 in 2000. This 26.7% increase resulted from (i) an increase in     recurring revenues from leased slot machines of approximately $12,700 in the     2001 period attributable to the addition of approximately 1,200 average     branded units in operation (at December 31, 2001, the Company had     approximately 2,700 branded slot machines on lease as compared to     approximately 2,000 at December 31, 2000) and (ii) a decrease of     approximately $3,400 in table games revenues reflecting the absence of a     nonrecurring sale of certain video and internet license rights of $2,587     which occurred in 2000 and a slight decrease in the average monthly lease     payment on leased table games during 2001.  2.  Product sales revenues in 2001 were $66,983 as compared to $65,970 in 2000,     an increase of $1,013, or 1.5%. This marginal increase during 2001 was due     principally to (i) an increase of approximately $5,000 in electronic display     products and (ii) an increase in international revenues of approximately     $1,500 offset, in part, by declines in interior and exterior visual display     products of approximately $5,000 and in systems revenues of approximately     $600.                                         25   OPERATING INCOME                                                                     Change                                                                  ------ Business segment:                       2001         2000     Amount      %      Comment - -----------------                       ----         ----     ------      --     -------            Gaming operations                    $ 15,738     $ 14,651    $ 1,087      7.4%      1 Product sales                           3,561       (2,404)     5,965   -248.1%      2                                      --------     --------    -------      Total segment      operating income                  19,299       12,247      7,052     57.6%  Corporate expenses                    (12,860)     (13,926)     1,066      7.7%      3 Impairment losses                      (1,702)                 (1,702)  -100.0%      4 Write-off of assets and other          (1,201)      (9,852)     8,651     87.8%      5                                      --------     --------    -------     Total operating income (loss)    $  3,536     $(11,531)   $15,067    130.7%                                      ========     ========    =======     Depreciation and amortization     -----------------------------     (included above):     -----------------          Gaming operations           $  7,730     $  6,346    $ 1,384     21.8%      6          Product sales                  1,419        1,592       (173)   -10.9%      6          Corporate                      3,257        3,179         78      2.5%      6                                      --------     --------    -------               Total depreciation               and amortization       $ 12,406     $ 11,117    $ 1,289     11.6%      6                                      ========     ========    =======   1. Gaming operations operating income in 2001 increased to $15,738 from $14,651    in 2000. This increase of $1,087, or 7.4%, was primarily due to the    aforementioned increase of $9,278 in gaming operations revenues offset, in    part, by an increase in bad debt provisions of approximately $1,400, an    increase in depreciation and rent expense of approximately $4,400 in the 2001    period and the absence of a nonrecurring sale and gross profit of certain    video and internet rights, which occurred in 2000, of $2,587. The increase in    bad debt provisions during the 2001 period occurred as a result of a    reevaluation of certain significant obligations of customers whose ability to    pay has been effected by the slowness in developing internet gaming in    various legalized jurisdictions. The increase in rent and depreciation    expense during the 2001 period was the result of the significant growth in    placements of branded slot machines in the Company's route operation, from an    average of approximately 1,300 machines in 2000 to approximately 2,300 in    2001 and, beginning in the latter part of 2000, the use of operating leases    to finance the purchase and placement of the machines.  2. Product sales operating income in 2001 increased by $5,965, from $(2,404) in    2000 to $3,561 in 2001. This improvement in operating income resulted from    the aforementioned increase in revenues of $1,013 and an improvement in the    gross profit percentage from 27% in 2000 to 33% in 2001. This gross margin    improvement of approximately $4,000 was primarily the result of (i) an    approximate $1,200 margin reduction in 2000 caused by start up costs related    to a new LED product, (ii) reduced provisions for inventory obsolescence of    approximately $1,000 in 2001 and (iii) a shift in the product sales mix. In    2001, the Company had a greater percentage of higher margin electronic    displays sold versus 2000 and a lower percentage of lower margin interior and    exterior sign displays sold. Additionally, product sales operating income in    2000 was adversely affected by the recording of approximately $3,700 of bad    debt provisions as compared to approximately $1,500 in 2001.  3. Corporate expenses in 2001 decreased by $1,066 or 7.7% from $13,926 in 2000    to $12,860 in 2001. This decrease was due to a decline in marketing expenses    due to reduced trade show expenses and promotional costs as well as a decline    in administrative incentive compensation.  4. During 2001, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $1,702 after an    analysis of the Company's business operations relating primarily to its    domestic exterior sign business and two of its foreign                                         26      business operations revealed that the carrying values were in excess of the    present net realizable values.  5. During 2001, the Company wrote-off certain non-producing fixed assets of    approximately $759, other assets related to its domestic exterior sign    business of approximately $142 and certain rights associated with the    Company's TableLink(TM) products of $300. This charge to write-off of assets    and other of $1,201 represents a decrease of $8,651 compared to the write-off    of assets and other in 2000 of $9,852, which related primarily to the write-    off of two older slot product lines of $2,430, surveillance assets of $720,    prepaid royalties of $3,356 and a charge to operations of $3,200 from the    effects of an adverse decision in a patent lawsuit.  6. Depreciation and amortization in 2001 increased by $1,289, or 11.6%, from    $11,117 in 2000 to $12,406 in 2001. This increase was primarily due to a    significant increase in the average number of leased slot machines in service    from 2000 to 2001 of approximately 1,200 machines.   INTEREST EXPENSE    Interest expense in 2001 was $11,729 compared to $10,516 in 2000.  This increase of $1,213, or 11.5%, was due to higher average outstanding borrowings in 2001 of approximately $7,000, due principally to the Company's refinancing in August, 2001, as well as a slightly higher average effective interest rate in 2001.  OTHER INCOME AND (EXPENSE)    Other income and expense, excluding interest income, in 2001 was net income of $1,023, an increase of $1,669 over the $646 of net expense incurred in 2000. This increase was principally due to the recognition of a net gain of $1,334 on the sale of a 50% interest in the Company's Australian subsidiary and systems sale.    Interest income in 2001 was $605 compared to $588 in 2000.  This increase of $17 was due principally to a significant increase in average cash and cash equivalent balances during the latter part of 2001 resulting from the net cash proceeds of the Company's refinancing in August 2001 offset, in part, by lower interest rates earned on cash deposits in 2001 and a decrease in interest income recorded from interest-bearing notes as certain charges have been deferred in 2001 pending cash receipt.  INCOME TAXES    During 2001 and 2000, the Company did not recognize an income tax benefit on the net loss of $9,700 and $22,105, respectively.  The Company has net operating loss carryforwards and believes it will recognize the benefits from the loss carryforwards as it earns income on a going-forward basis.  EXTRAORDINARY ITEM    In connection with the Company's August 2001 refinancing and early extinguishment of certain of its outstanding debt obligations (see Liquidity and Capital Resources, below), the Company incurred extraordinary charges for the early extinguishment of debt, totaling $3,135, during the year ended December 31, 2001.  LOSS PER SHARE    Both basic and diluted loss per share before extraordinary item for 2001 were $0.56 on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of 11,750. Both basic and diluted loss per share for 2001 were $0.83 on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of 11,750. Both basic and diluted loss per share for 2000 were $2.02 on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of 10,968.                                         27   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999  REVENUES                                                                  Change                                                               ------ Business segment:                 2000        1999      Amount       %         Comment - -----------------                 ----        ----      ------       --        -------            Gaming operations               $ 34,796    $ 25,256    $  9,540    37.8%     1 Product sales                     65,970      81,628     (15,658)  -19.2%     2                                ---------    --------    --------       Total                      $100,766    $106,884    $ (6,118)   -5.7%                                =========    ========    ======== Percentage of total revenues:      Gaming operations              34.5%       23.6%      Product sales                  65.5%       76.4%                                ---------    --------           Total                    100.0%      100.0%                                =========    ========   1. Gaming operations revenues in 2000 increased by $9,540 or 37.8% from $25,256    in 1999 to $34,796 in 2000, which was due to:  (i) an increase in recurring    revenues from leased slot machines of $8,764 attributable to the addition    during the year of 1,800 branded units placed in operation and (ii) an    increase of $776 reflecting a 2.8% increase in the number of table games on    lease and slightly higher revenues per game.  Sales of license rights related    to our table game products of $2,587 in 2000 and $2,750 in 1999 are included    in gaming operations revenues.  2. Product sales revenues in 2000 decreased by $15,658 or 19.2% from $81,628 in    1999 to $65,970 in 2000, which was primarily due to:  (i) a decrease of    $7,650 representing the 1999 revenues of our former Australian subsidiary    which could not be consolidated in 2000 due to the divestiture of a 50%    interest at the end of 1999 and our share of the loss experienced by the    Australian affiliate in 2000, which amounted to $215, (ii) a decrease of    $5,183 in systems revenues due to a large system sale in Canada during 1999    that was not matched in 2000 by a comparable sale and (iii) a decrease of    $2,949 in revenues from European operations.                                         28   OPERATING INCOME                                                                                                Change                                                                                            ------ Business segment:                               2000                1999             Amount                 %             Comment - -----------------                               ----                ----             -------                -             -------            Gaming operations                             $ 14,651            $ 11,660           $  2,991               25.7%            1 Product sales                                   (2,404)             10,678            (13,082)            -122.5%            2                                               --------            --------           --------      Total segment       operating income                          12,247              22,338            (10,091)             -45.2%  Write-off of assets and other                   (9,852)             (1,352)            (8,500)             628.7%            3 Corporate expenses                             (13,926)            (12,266)            (1,660)              13.5%            4                                               --------            --------           --------       Total operating income       (loss)                                  $(11,531)           $  8,720           $(20,251)            -232.2%                                               ========            ========           ========       Depreciation and Amortization      -----------------------------      (included above):      -----------------           Gaming operations                   $  6,346            $  4,832           $  1,514               31.3%            5           Product sales                          1,592               2,030               (438)             -21.6%            5           Corporate                              3,179               2,487                692               27.8%            5                                               --------            --------           --------                Total depreciation and                Amortization                   $ 11,117            $  9,349           $  1,768               18.9%            5                                               ========            ========           ========   1.   Gaming operations operating income in 2000 increased by $2,991, or 25.7%,      from $11,660 in 1999 to $14,651 in 2000, which was primarily due to an      111.6% increase in gross profits from leased slot machines attributable to      the substantial increase in the installed base, as 1,800 new branded slot      machines were placed in service in 2000. Equipment rental expense of $547      in 2000, related to slot machine operating leases, was included in gaming      operations operating expenses. Gaming operations expense for 2000 included      $347 in bad debt expense. Included in gaming operations costs of sales was      $1,553 of inventory writedowns related to an older slot machine product      line.   2.   Product sales operating income in 2000 decreased by $13,082, or 122.5%,      from $10,678 in 1999 to $(2,404) in 2000, which was primarily due to the      $15,658 decrease in gaming product revenues, thus the primary reason for a      decrease in gaming product gross profit margin of $11,248. Gross profit      margins decreased to 27.0% from 35.6% in 1999. The margin reduction      reflects lower margins for the exterior sign business, resulting from a      $1,231 reduction in gross profit due primarily to startup costs related to      a new LED product. The Gulfport, Mississippi, interior sign factory also      had lower margins prior to the phase-out of that manufacturing facility,      which reduced gross profit by $756. Included in the lower operating profits      are the effects of $3,752 in inventory charges and $3,687 in reserves for      bad debts which we believe are higher than the historical amounts of      inventory and bad debt reserves and charges. This increase relates to the      strategic repositioning initiative, changing economic conditions and      changing customer credit circumstances. A summary of the major cost impacts      described above for the product sales segment for 2000 is as follows:                                         29                                 Description                                           Amount                             -----------                                           ------           Lower exterior sign gross margins due primarily to the LED           startup costs                                                            $1,231      Lower margins in the Gulfport, Mississippi  interior sign           facility prior to phasing out production                                    756      Inventory reserves                                                             3,752      Bad debt expenses                                                              3,687                                                                                 ---------                                                                                    $9,426                                                                                 =========   3.  As a result of our increased focus on our gaming operations and branded slot     machines following the review conducted as part of our strategic     repositioning initiative, we determined that certain of our older non-     branded slot machine games, surveillance assets and prepaid royalties     related to a licensing agreement had balance sheet values in excess of their     present realizable value. This resulted in charges to revalue assets related     to two older slot product lines of $2,430, surveillance assets of $720 and     prepaid royalties of $3,356. In addition, we accounted for the effects of an     adverse decision in a patent suit on March 27, 2001 resulting in a charge to     operations of $3,200. See Note 9 - Impairment, Write-Off of Assets, and     Other and Extraordinary Item in the Notes to Consolidated Financial     Statements.   4.  Corporate expenses in 2000 increased by $1,660 or 13.5% from $12,266 in 1999     to $13,926 in 2000, which was primarily due to including the costs related     to two major trade shows in the current year resulting in an increase of     $546. We also had non-cash charges related to stock options of $210 and     professional services related to the restated financial statements of $397.     Corporate depreciation and amortization also increased $692. See Note 5     below.   5.  Depreciation and amortization in 2000 increased by $1,768 or 18.9% from     $9,349 in 1999 to $11,117 in 2000. Gaming operations depreciation and     amortization increased by $1,514 or 31.3% to $6,346 due to additional slot     games that were placed in service. Product sales depreciation and     amortization decreased $438 or 21.6% due to the removal of a leased exterior     sign that was being depreciated. Corporate depreciation and amortization     increased due to new investments for patents, licenses, software development     and related warrants.  INTEREST EXPENSE      Interest expense in 2000 increased by $1,666 or 18.8% from $8,850 in 1999 to $10,516 in 2000. The increase was due to increases in the interest rate on our variable rate loans reflecting changes in the market interest rate as well as an amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that resulted in a 0.5% interest rate increase.  The average interest rate, which includes amortization of loan costs, on the average amount of all outstanding debt for 2000 was 11.9%, as compared to 9.2% for 1999.  See Note 10 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  OTHER INCOME AND (EXPENSE)      Other income and expense excluding interest income in 2000 was a net expense increase of $1,001, from a net other income of $355 in 1999 to a net other expense of $646 in 2000.  The difference was due primarily to a gain on the sale of real estate in 1999 as well as to various tax and miscellaneous expenses in 2000.      Interest income in 2000 increased by $223 or 61.1% from $365 in 1999, to $588 in 2000. The increase was primarily due to interest received related to a license agreement as well as interest from our non-consolidated Australian affiliate.                                         30   INCOME TAXES       In 2000, we did not recognize an income tax benefit on the net loss of $22,105, as compared to 1999 when we recognized a tax benefit of $342.  We believe we will recognize the tax benefit on this loss as we earn income on a going-forward basis.  EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE       Both basic and diluted loss per share for 2000 were $2.02 on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of 10,968. Both basic and diluted earnings per share for 1999 were $0.09 on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of 10,720 and 10,784, respectively.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company incurred a net loss of $9,700.  Net cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2001 were $15,124, an increase of $14,662 from $462 at December 31, 2000. This increase was principally due to the receipt of approximate net cash proceeds of $17,900 from the refinancing of certain notes and the issuance of additional common stock in August 2001 offset by the payment of outstanding notes and obligations to First Source Financial and the payment of debt issue costs. Working capital increased to $38,462 at December 31, 2001 from $36,977 at December 31, 2000, an increase of $1,485.  This working capital increase was principally the result of an increase in cash of approximately $14,700 offset by decreases in receivables and inventories of approximately $11,300 and an increase to accrued liabilities of approximately $1,600.       Cash provided by operating activities was $9,774 in 2001.  The significant items affecting this amount were a net loss of $9,700 offset by non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization, impairment and extraordinary losses, other non- cash gains, valuation provisions and other asset write-offs of approximately $27,300.  Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities also affecting cash provided by operating activities were primarily net increases of receivables of approximately $2,100, other assets of approximately $1,400 and inventories of approximately $2,600 and net decreases of current liabilities, deferred revenue and other liabilities of approximately $1,700.       Cash used in investing activities was $12,631 in 2001. The significant items affecting this amount were the purchases of inventory leased to others of approximately $13,000, purchases of property and equipment of approximately $2,300 and an increase to intangible assets of approximately $1,400 offset, in part, by proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions of $3,500.       Cash provided by financing activities was $17,462 in 2001. The significant items affecting this amount were proceeds from the issuance of notes payable of approximately $99,700, proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants of approximately $9,400 and proceeds from capital lease transactions of $2,000 offset, in part, by principal payments on notes, capital leases and payments for debt issuance costs of approximately $93,100.       On August 22, 2001, the Company completed the private placement of $105,000 of its 11.875% Senior Secured Notes ("Indenture") due 2008 and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 420,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $7.70 per share. Interest payments of $6,234 are due on May 1, and November 1, until 2008. The Senior Secured Notes due 2008 are secured by a security interest in certain of the Company's assets and certain assets of the Guarantor subsidiaries. The Indenture includes a covenant whereby the Company is to maintain $5,000 of available liquidity as defined in the Indenture. On or after August 15, 2005, the Company will have the right to redeem all or some of the notes at a price that will decrease over time from 105.938% of the principal amount in 2005 to 100% of the principal amount in 2007, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following each fiscal year, if the Company has excess cash flow for such fiscal year, the Company will offer to purchase up to an aggregate principal amount of notes equal to 50% of such excess cash flow at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company also completed, on August 10, 2001, the sale of 1,500,000                                         31   shares of its common stock to institutional investors in a private placement for $8,250. The total proceeds were used to retire certain term loans and other credit facilities, to fund related fees and expenses and for working capital purposes.       In February 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of a $17,500 working capital revolving line of credit facility (the "Facility") with Foothill Capital Corporation. Borrowings under the Facility are based on (i) eligible accounts receivable, as defined in the Facility, up to $7,500 with interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% or prime plus 0.75% and (ii) Table Game EBITDA, as defined in the Facility, up to $10,000 with interest at prime plus a range of 2.0% to 3.5% depending on debt coverage ratios. Any borrowings under the Facility will be secured by a first secured interest in substantially all of the Company's assets. We are subject to a 0.5% per annum unused line fee. The Facility has early payoff penalties during the term of the line at 3.0% during the first year, 2.0% during the second year and 1.0% during the third year. The Facility includes certain restrictive financial covenants, including maintenance of $20,000 of annual EBITDA, minimum table games revenue of $750 monthly and a table game installed base of no less than 600 games. The Facility has an initial term of three years.       Based on the amount of cash in banks of approximately $15,100, cash generated from operations and based on the availability of funds from the Company's recently acquired line of credit facility, management believes the Company has sufficient working capital on both a short and long-term basis.

During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into a series of sale-leaseback transactions with various third party finance companies.  The transactions involve gaming equipment, have a term of 40 months, a fair value purchase option at the end of the term, and are being accounted for as operating leases. Proceeds from these sale-leaseback transactions totaled $15,000.       Also during 2000, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with respect to one of its buildings in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a term of 17 years and a fair value purchase option at the end of the term. The leaseback is being accounted for as an operating lease. Proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction were $2,668. The Company recorded a deferred gain from this transaction of $269 which is being amortized, straight-line over the term of the lease as a reduction in rental expense. The lease contains a minimum net worth requirement with which the Company was in violation at December 31, 2001. Because of the violation, the Company paid $800 in 2001 for a letter of credit to secure future rent payments to the landlord and potentially could be obligated to purchase an additional $2,200 letter of credit.       During 2001, the Company entered into two sale-leaseback transactions with various third party finance companies. The transactions involve gaming equipment, have terms of 40 months and 44 months and are being treated as capital leases. Proceeds from these sale-leaseback transactions totaled $2,000.       During 2000, the Company entered into a series of sale-leaseback transactions with various third party finance companies. The transactions involve gaming equipment, have a term of 40 months and are being treated as capital leases. Proceeds from these sale-leaseback transactions totaled $3,000.                                         32                                                  Total Other Commercial                            Amount              Less than              1-3                 4-5              After 5 Commitments                                Committed             1 year               years               years              years - -----------                                ---------             ------               -----               -----              -----             Standby letters of credit                  $2,300               $1,500                $  -                $  -              $800                                             ------               ------                ----                ----              ----       Total commercial commitments          $2,300               $1,500                $  -                $  -              $800                                             ======               ======                ====                ====              ====   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES       Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Certain of our accounting policies, including the estimated lives assigned to our assets, the determination of bad debts, inventory valuation reserves, asset impairment and self insurance reserves require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of industry trends, information provided by or gathered from our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates. To provide an understanding of the methodology we apply, our significant accounting policies are discussed where appropriate in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS       In June 2001, the FASB issued two new standards, SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Together these statements will change the accounting for business combinations and goodwill. SFAS 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of- interests method. SFAS 142 changes the accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach. Thus, amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded in past business combinations, will cease upon adoption of SFAS 142. Amortization will still be required for identifiable intangible assets with finite lives. The provisions of SFAS 142 are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Early application is permitted for entities with fiscal years beginning after March 15, 2001, provided that the first interim financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 142 at the beginning of 2002. The impact that SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 will have on our financial condition or results of operations will be to reduce amortization expense of certain assets previously amortized by approximately $1,700 annually beginning in 2002.  The Company will also be required to make an initial impairment assessment and review goodwill for impairment on an ongoing basis, at least annually.       In July 2001, the SEC issued SAB No. 102, Selected Loan Loss Allowance Methodology and Documentation Issues. SAB 102 gives guidance on the documentation and methodologies used in the determination of loan loss allowances. We believe the adoption of this bulletin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.       In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, which will begin January 1, 2002.  Based on a recent analysis, we believe the adoption of this bulletin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.                                         33   CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER       During 2001, the Company spent approximately $2,300 for purchases of property and equipment and approximately $13,000 for purchases of inventory leased to others. Purchases of property and equipment are limited to $6,000 per year under the terms of the Company's recently acquired revolving Facility. The Company presently does not plan any significant purchases of property and equipment for the year ending December 31, 2002. The Company plans to purchase inventory for lease to others only to the extent that specific machines not currently on lease or participation at casinos are used or based on contractual commitments with the supplier of its gaming machines. The Company, in March 2002, entered into a contractual commitment to purchase a minimum of 125 slot machines each calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003 for a new slot machine introduction. These purchases will total approximately $4,000. Presently, the Company owns or leases approximately 500 machines which are not currently in use at casinos. Planned purchases for slot machines (inventory leased to others), therefore, for 2002 should be significantly less than in 2001. The Company acquired certain rights to develop software from its supplier of slot machines in exchange for an advance payment on royalties. The advance royalty payment made by the Company in April 2002 was approximately $1,600.       In March 2002, the Company closed a transaction with an owner of patents and intellectual property relating to two unique poker games. As part of this transaction, the Company loaned $1,500 to the owner, to be paid back to the Company within three years at a 10.0% rate of interest.                                         34   Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  MARKET RISK       All dollar amounts reported in this section are expressed in thousands and rounded to the nearest thousand while units are expressed in whole amounts unless otherwise stated.  Foreign Currency Risk       There are two types of foreign currency exchange risks that a company may be subject to: transaction and translation gains or losses. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are distinguished from translation gains or losses as follows: (i) translation adjustments do not involve the movement of cash, they are accounting conversion calculations of an existing functional currency to a reporting currency and (ii) transaction gain or losses, however, are based on an actual transaction that requires formal payment at a future point in time.       We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk relating to the translation of the our foreign subsidiaries' asset, liability, income and expense accounts. Our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at the end of the period. The income and expense accounts are translated using the average rate of exchange during the period. Due to the long-term nature of our investment in our foreign operations, 75% of our intercompany translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component in stockholders' equity, and the remaining amount is recognized in the our consolidated statement of operations. Although we do not regularly incur gains or losses of specific foreign currency transactions and do not believe that these amounts would be material, these gains and losses would be reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. For the year ended 2001, we did not have any forwards, options or other derivative contracts in force. We do not consider our existing foreign currency translation exposure to be material.  Interest Rate Risk       We have total interest bearing debt of approximately $110,000 before discounts. The components of this amount have fixed rates of interest and we therefore, do not have exposure to the fluctuation of market interest rates. However, we recently acquired a $17,500 revolving line of credit which bears floating rate interest on outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2001, we had not yet obtained this line of credit. Any future borrowings will be exposed to market rate risk. We periodically review our interest rate exposure, if any, on our long-term debt and, as market conditions warrant, we may enter into an interest rate cap or swap agreements in order to manage this exposure. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we did not have any agreements in force.
