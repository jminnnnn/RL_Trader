Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein. Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include risks detailed in Part I, Item I under the caption Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on  Form 10-K .    Overview     We are a leading developer and marketer of technology-based products for the gaming industry. Our business consists of two reportable segments:                       Slot and Table Games.  Our table and slot games segment develops, acquires, licenses and distributes proprietary and non-proprietary branded and non-branded table and slot games. We lease our table and slot games and license our content to customers in exchange for recurring revenue consisting of (i) fixed periodic fees, (ii) a percentage of the net win (net win produced by a gaming device is defined as the gross revenue minus all jackpots, payouts and any approved claims) of the gaming devices for our more popular titles or (iii) license fees for any proprietary slot game content provided to third parties for use on their game hardware. We also receive one-time license fees for our table and slot game content. During 2003, we shifted our business model from focusing on table and slot hardware assembly operations to third party manufacturers and distributors. In connection with this transition, we incurred approximately $2.5 million of other expenses related to the write-down of obsolete slot machines and related hardware, as well as $0.6 million in related severance expense. This shift allowed us to focus our human and capital resources on developing and distributing game content, a business with higher margins and lower capital expenditures.                           Systems.  Our systems segment consists of the license of our management and progressive jackpot systems. These systems enable casinos to track the wagers placed by both table and slot players as well as accurately account for the performance of each table and slot game. These systems also enable casinos to implement their own progressive jackpots and bonusing. Systems revenues are primarily comprised of software, hardware and support services, which comprise of both upfront payments as well as recurring fees based on the total number of gaming devices under management.       Our historical products segment, which included our interior sign division sold in the second quarter of 2005 and our electronic jackpot and mystery systems, has been revised. We will now include electronic jackpot and mystery systems in our system segment.   A significant portion of our revenues is generated from the license of systems, intellectual property and game content. Our licensing revenues were 20% and 13% of our overall revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in license revenues is primarily a result of our continued focus on our technology and content business model. In both 2004 and 2005, approximately half of our license fees related to game content and half related to systems and intellectual property licenses. Significant licensing transactions during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 include the license of our Caribbean Stud ®  game to certain large customers and distributors, and the license of certain intellectual property to other gaming suppliers for use in their products.   In December 2004, we announced our intent to focus the business on game content and technology and completed several strategic transactions immediately following this decision (see Acquisitions / Divestitures below). We revised our business segment reporting in the third quarter of 2005 as a result of the realignment of the business. Also, in 2003, we expanded the disclosure of our revenues and expenses. The principal changes from previous presentations were related to the disclosure of direct and indirect costs of revenues by segment, and separate disclosure of significant expenses related to slot rent, research and development, and depreciation and amortization. This more expanded view of our operating lines of business classifies royalties as a cost of revenue along with other direct costs of revenues by business segment. Previous presentations classified this cost as a reduction of revenues. Operating income or loss, net income or loss, and basic and fully diluted earnings or loss per share for prior periods are unchanged from previous presentations. With respect to our current segments, we evaluate performance and allocate resources based upon profit or loss from operations before income taxes. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of critical accounting policies below.   Acquisitions / Divestitures     In December 2004, we entered into two strategic transactions to enhance our table games and table systems products. First, we agreed to acquire the table games management system, PitTrak ® , including its existing customer base from Hotel Systems Pty, Ltd. of Sydney Australia. PitTrak ®  has a similar functionality as TableLink ®  and provided us with an existing installed base of over 400 tables and access to sell its management solutions worldwide. The purchase of PitTrak ®  was completed in January 2005. We also purchased and exclusively licensed certain suites of patents related to player card image based recognition (IBR) and licensed the exclusive rights to develop and distribute an IBR card recognition shoe.   In connection with our focus on game content and technology we sold our interior sign division during May 2005.   In June 2005, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license with Magellan, a developer of advanced, high-speed ISO-compliant RFID systems. We licensed, on an exclusive basis, for the life of the subject patents, Magellans rights to its RFID reader, tag and related intellectual property for any gaming applications. We also purchased a minority equity stake in Magellan.   In conjunction with the development of our slot and content technology, we acquired VirtGame Corp. during the fourth quarter of 2005 in a stock swap in which we will issue 1,758,498 shares of our common stock. VirtGame Corp. was a provider of open architecture gaming software primarily focused on the delivery of central server-based slot games and centrally managed sports betting.   On November 28, 2005, we acquired EndX, a global gaming management systems software company headquartered in the United Kingdom, for approximately $29.2 million in cash, including transaction costs. EndX had been one of our key strategic partners for over three years.   Financing and Other Matters     Debt Retirement.  During 2003, we completed a private placement for approximately $45.0 million from selling 8.4 million shares of our Common Stock at a price of $5.34 per share and warrants to acquire an additional 2.1 million shares at an exercise price of $5.875 per share. Proceeds from the transaction were used to repurchase and retire $40.0 million of the Companys 11.875% senior secured notes due 2008, or the Notes, and to pay the associated fees and costs. This transaction will reduce our annual interest expense by approximately $4.0 million. This refinancing resulted in the incurrence of $9.5 million of non-cash charges ($5.3 million related to the write-off of unamortized bond discounts and $4.2 million related to the implied fair value of warrants issued in the refinancing), including $3.4 million of transaction fees and expenses.   - 32 -        We retired $20.0 million of our Notes during 2005. We have recognized a loss on early retirement of $3.0 million, comprising $1.8 million of non-cash charges related to the write-off of unamortized bond discounts and unamortized debt issue costs, and a call premium of $1.2 million paid in cash.   Equity Offering.  During 2005, we completed a public equity offering of approximately 8.3 million shares of our Common Stock at a price of $9.25 per share. Proceeds from the transaction were approximately $70.0 million, and were used to repurchase and retire $20.0 million of the Companys Notes, fund strategic developments and acquisitions, including the acquisition of EndX, and provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes.

Slot and table games.  During 2005, we announced our intent to dispose of our legacy slot route to allow us to focus on central-server based gaming technology. In September 2005, we licensed our legacy slot operating system to a third party as more fully described in Note 1 in the accompanying financial statements. As a result of these events, our legacy slot revenues declined in 2005. We plan to introduce our central-server based games in certain jurisdictions during 2006.   We continue to increase our pipeline of new slot content to replace legacy slot brands as they expire or decline in popularity. In December 2005 our license arrangement with Hasbro for the Yahtzee ®  and Battleship ®  brands expired. However, the Company has recently introduced new brands such as KISS ® , the Beach Boys ® , and Ed McMahon as well as 34 non-branded slot titles. We expect our revenues from legacy brands to decline but anticipate a significant increase in revenues from this new pipeline of slot content during 2006.   Historically our table games arrangements were lease agreements, generally with terms of one to three years. In late 2004, we began selling our Caribbean Stud ®  table games to certain large customers and distributors under perpetual license / sale arrangements. Our Texas HoldEm Bonus poker / World Series of Poker ®  game will continue to be leased under arrangements with terms of one to three years.   Slot and table game revenues for 2005 decreased by 17% compared to 2004. Slot revenues decreased 42.4% for the year ended December 31, 2005, and table revenues decreased 27.6 % for the same period. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in slot and table revenues under daily fee arrangements, partially offset by higher licensing revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our slot route revenues declined due to a decrease in the installed base under daily fee arrangements (from 1,666 in 2004 to 336 in 2005) and slightly lower net win (net win produced by a slot machine is defined as the gross revenue minus all jackpots, payouts, fills and any approved claims). We anticipate our slot revenues will increase during 2006 as we release new slot machine brands and obtain regulatory approvals for existing products. Our table games installed base under daily fee arrangements declined from 932 in 2004 to 785 in 2005, primarily due to the conversion of Caribbean Stud ®  tables from lease arrangements to perpetual license arrangements. These conversions resulted in a decline of our recurring revenue base but increased our one-time licensing revenues. Overall, table game revenues declined as a result of these conversions and as a result of a lower daily fee under our remaining lease arrangements. We expect our daily fees under our lease arrangements to increase as we place our progressive version of Texas HoldEm Bonus poker / World Series of Poker ®  in 2006.   Slot and table game revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 were consistent with revenues earned in 2003. Revenues from slot contracts under daily fee arrangements declined, but were offset by increases in revenues under our periodic fee arrangements and increases in license fees from intellectual property rights. The decline in daily fee arrangements was attributable to a slight decrease in win per unit and a lower installed base. Table games revenues were also flat in 2004 compared to 2003 and there was no material shift in the installed base or fee per day of outstanding table game contracts in the same periods.   Interior signage.  The interior signage segment, which was sold in the second quarter of 2005, manufactured and sold interior casino signage and related products. The interior signage operation previously was combined with the electronic jackpot and mystery systems in the Products Segment. In 2005, we revised our segment information to be more consistent with our new business model. We now report our revenues in two segments: (1) slot and table games and (2) systems and electronic jackpot and mystery systems. As a result of this change, we have reclassified our 2004 revenues to conform to the current segment presentation. We have not made   - 33 -        these conforming changes for 2003 because the information necessary to conform to the current presentation is not available.   Systems.  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, our systems revenues were $39.3 million, representing an increase of 9.8% as compared to 2004. This improvement was primarily due to increased demand for our CasinoLink ®  Enterprise Edition products. Our table management installed base grew approximately 80% over 2004. We continue to report consistent increases in our slot management installed base, including an 18% growth in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, systems revenues were $15.0 million, representing a 7.9% increase over the prior year. TableLink Systems revenue nearly doubled in 2004 compared to 2003 due to several large installations in Canada and Native American jurisdictions. Maintenance revenues also increased year-over-year as we continue to grow our installed base of both CasinoLink and TableLink.   Gross profit.  Gross profit decreased in 2005 versus 2004 due to higher systems hardware sales in 2005 compared to 2004. Gross profit increased in 2004 versus 2003 as a result of changes in our product mix with higher margin generated from slot contracts under periodic fee arrangements.

SG&A increased by approximately $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004, and decreased by approximately $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was due primarily to additional legal and compliance costs necessary to continue to achieve regulatory approvals for our new products, costs incurred in connection with the documentation and testing of our business processes under the new corporate governance requirements and continued investments in upgrading our human capital. In 2003, selling, general and administrative expense included a $5.8 million write-down of assets that no longer generated sufficient cash flow to support their carrying value, severance and other costs associated with the reductions in service, international and management personnel and the closing of the manufacturing facility at our European subsidiary; and the separation and post-employment agreement costs for certain officers and directors.   Slot rent expense.  Slot rent expense is the use of operating leases to finance the purchase and placement of slot machines. Slot rent expense decreased substantially in 2004 due to the expiration of slot leases during the current fiscal year. As of December 31, 2004, substantially all of our slot leases were expired or terminated.   Research and development expense (R&D).  Our R&D spending continues to increase as we focus on developing game content for licensing to third parties and the further development of our casino management systems products through CasinoLink ®  Enterprise Edition  Modular Casino Management System. During 2005, research and development expense increased by 32.1% compared to the same period in 2004. During 2004, research and development expense increased by 18.3% compared to the same period in 2003. We expect R&D to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue during fiscal 2006 as part of this change in our business model.   Depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization decreased 45.1% in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of the $4.9 million write-down of our legacy slot hardware in June 2005. Depreciation and amortization also decreased 37.8% in 2004 compared to 2003 due to a change in the depreciable lives of our fixed assets. During 2003, the Company had determined that the useful lives of its existing slot machines should be accelerated as these assets were expected to be replaced. As of September 2004, the Company had not replaced these slot machines and has subsequently invested in refurbishment hardware for these devices. As such, the useful lives of these machines have been extended consistent with industry standards.   Net gain on disposition of non-core assets.  During 2005, we recognized a net gain on disposition of non-core assets of $2.5 million as a result of completing two key strategic transactions. During the second quarter, we completed the sale of the interior sign division, which resulted in a gain of approximately $7.4 million including transaction costs. Additionally, we commenced the process of repositioning our existing slot machine platform to focus on central-server based game and third party content development. In connection with this repositioning, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell certain non-gaming slot hardware related to our existing   - 34 -        platform. In connection with the repositioning, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.9 million equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair value determined by the selling price.   Gain on sale of core intellectual property.  During the third quarter of 2005, we completed a strategic licensing transaction, whereby we sold the remaining rights to certain intellectual property in a barter transaction, but retained a non-exclusive license in the intellectual property for use in our operations.   Interest expense.  Interest expense decreased $0.8 million during 2005 due to the retirement of $20 million of the Senior Secured Notes during the fourth quarter, and due to the completion of amortizing certain debt issue costs. Interest expense decreased $4.6 million during 2004 due to the retirement of $40.0 million of Senior Secured Notes in late 2003.   Loss on early retirement of debt . During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a $3.0 million loss on the early retirement of $20.0 million of our Senior Secured Notes. Of this charge, $1.2 million was a call premium paid in cash, and $1.8 million was a non-cash charge related to writing off related debt discount and prepaid debt issue costs.   Other income.  Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash deposits. Other income increased in 2005 compared to 2004, and in 2004 compared to 2003, due to larger accumulations of cash and cash equivalents during those years.   Income taxes.  The Company did not recognize a tax benefit or provision related to its domestic operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 or 2003 due to the Companys net operating loss position. In 2004 and 2003, the income tax benefits recorded in the statements of operations related primarily to foreign tax credits and state income tax adjustments.   Earnings (loss) per share.  Basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $(0.24) on 25.1 million basic and diluted average common shares outstanding. The basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $0.01 on 21.9 million basic and 22.4 million diluted average common shares outstanding. Both basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2003 were ($2.33) on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 14.7 million.   Liquidity and Capital Resources     During 2005, cash generated from operations, warrant and option exercises and from our equity offering in the fourth quarter was used primarily for the acquisitions of PitTrak, VirtGame and EndX, the acquisition of various types of strategic IP, the retirement of a portion of our high yield debt, debt service and working capital.   For 2005, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $6.0 million. Net cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2005 were $14.1 million, an increase of approximately $1.8 million from $12.3 million at December 31, 2004. Working capital increased from $18.3 million at December 31, 2004 to $31.9 million at December 31, 2005. The working capital increase of approximately $13.6 million was due principally to a $1.8 million increase in cash, a $9.3 million increase in receivables, a $1.0 million increase in prepaids, a $0.2 increase in inventories, and a $1.8 million decrease in customer deposits, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The increase in receivables was related to a significant increase in the contract sales of IP and content, reflected in contracts receivable, offset by payment receipts and a reduction from the sale of the interior sign division.   Significant components of cash flows from operations are as follows:                                   (Amounts in millions)                             Net loss         $    (6.0          )      Non-cash items              6.6           Gain on disposition of non-core assets              (2.5          )      Loss on early retirement of debt              3.0           Other changes in assets and liabilities              (22.4          )                                                       Net cash used in operations         $    (21.3          )                             Other changes in assets and liabilities includes an increase in receivables of $11.1 million, primarily due to a significant increase in the licensing and sale of intellectual property and content, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $6.6 million, primarily prepaid royalties for game content.   Cash used in investing activities during 2005 was approximately $36.2 million, consisting primarily of $36.2 million in net cash payments for acquisitions, $8.7 million in capitalized costs of intangible assets, and $2.8 million purchases of fixed assets, partially offset by $11.5 million in net proceeds from sales of non-core assets and fixed assets.   Cash provided by financing activities was approximately $59.6 million during 2005. The significant components of this amount were $69.9 million in net cash received from an equity offering, $11.4 million from the exercise of options and warrants, partially offset by $21.2 million in principal and call premium paid to retire a portion of our Senior Secured Notes, $0.4 million in treasury stock purchases, and $0.1 million paid on capital leases and other noncurrent debt.   The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations for long-term debt, capital leases, interest expense, operating leases, license fees and employment agreements for the periods shown:                                                                                                                                                 Less than         1  3         4  5         After 5      (Amount in thousands)         Total         1 year         Years         Years         Years         Contractual Obligations                                                                                                          Long-term debt         $    45,284              $    284              $    45,000              $                  $               Capital lease obligations              28                   28                                                                    Interest expense              15,586                   5,344                   10,242                                                 Operating leases              9,777                   2,714                   4,637                   2,251                   175           License / Development              21,861                   7,834                   9,970                   1,972                   2,085           Employment agreements              413                   413                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Total         $    92,949              $    16,617              $    69,849              $    4,223              $    2,260                                                                                              - 35 -         The table above excludes accretion of debt discount of $1.0 million for the periods shown.   Although there can be no assurance, we believe that the cash on hand of $14.1 million at December 31, 2005, along with the expected increase in cash flows from operations over the next 12 months, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital needs through December 31, 2006. Additionally, management is in the process of evaluating financing alternatives, including a credit facility. This financing would likely be used for ongoing contractual commitments, strategic investments in intellectual property, and other operating purposes.    Employment Agreements     We have entered into employment contracts, with our corporate officers and certain other key employees. Significant contract provisions include minimum annual base salaries, healthcare benefits, life insurance benefits, bonus compensation if performance measures are achieved, changes in control (CIC), grants of restricted stock, incentive stock options and non-compete provisions. These contracts are primarily at will employment agreements, under which we or the employee may terminate employment. If we terminate any of these employees without cause, then we are obligated to pay the employee severance benefits as specified in their individual contract.   Purchase Commitments     From time to time, we enter into commitments with our vendors to purchase inventory at fixed prices or in guaranteed quantities. From time to time we also enter into certain intellectual property license arrangements that require upfront payments upon signing and/or additional payments upon our election to renew the licenses. In addition, we may choose to negotiate and renew licenses upon their normal expiration. No assurances can be given as to the terms of such renewals, if any.   In August 2004, we signed a license and development agreement with IGT to license segments of our patent portfolio of technology and to develop video slot games based on our content, for a term continuing until the last to expire of the patent rights under the agreement. The new games are to be developed on IGTs game platform and distributed by us. Pursuant to this agreement, IGT also licenses aspects of its intellectual property to us for its games and we are committed to purchase from IGT a minimum of 600 slot machines carrying our game content on them over the life of the agreement. The Company will be required to pay for the slot machines through a daily fee arrangement whereby IGT will receive an amount equal to 25% of the Companys gross revenue derived from the slot machines, with a minimum of $12.50 per day per machine, as defined in the agreement.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons.   Capital Expenditures and Other     During 2005, we spent approximately $1.9 million for purchases of property and equipment and $.9 million for purchases of inventory leased to others. We expect to spend approximately the same amount for capital expenditures in 2006.   We are a party to post-employment agreements entered into in August 2002 with our former CEO and CFO to provide cash payments of approximately $2.8 million and $0.8 million respectively. The agreements require payments subsequent to December 31, 2002 of approximately $2.0 million plus medical costs through August 2006. In March 2003, we reached an agreement with our former CEO whereby he resigned from the board of directors and specifically as chairman of the board. In March 2003, we paid our former CEO all outstanding future payments totaling approximately $1.4 million and agreed to pay certain legal costs incurred by the former CEO in the approximate amount of $0.5 million.   Share Repurchase Plan     On August 13, 2002 our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $2.0 million of our common stock. The purchases may be made from time to time in the open market. The timing and actual number of shares to be purchased will depend on market conditions. Through December 31, 2005, we have purchased approximately 254,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $1.3 million.   Critical Accounting Policies     Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant estimates, judgments and assumptions, that we believe are reasonable, in calculating the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of known industry trends, and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. On a regular basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to lives assigned to our assets, the determination of bad debts, inventory valuation reserves, asset impairment and self-insurance reserves. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates.   We have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations: revenue recognition, receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories and obsolescence, and long-lived asset impairment. To provide an understanding of the methodology we apply these and other significant accounting policies discussed below and where appropriate in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.   Revenue Recognition     The Company recognizes revenue as follows:   Slot and Table Games.  We lease and sell proprietary slot and table games to casino customers. Table game lease contracts are typically for a 36-month period with a 30-day cancellation clause. The lease revenue is recognized on a monthly basis. Slot machine lease contracts are either on revenue participation or a fixed-rental basis. Slot machine lease contracts are typically for a month-to-month period with a 30-day cancellation clause. On a participation basis, we earn a share of the revenue that the casino earns from these slot machines. On a fixed-rental basis, we charge a fixed amount per slot machine per day. Revenues from both types of lease arrangements are recognized on the accrual basis. The sales agreements for proprietary table games and slot games consist of the sale of hardware and a perpetual license for the proprietary intellectual property. Slot and table game sales are executed by a signed contract or a customer purchase order. We generally recognize revenues for these sales agreements when the hardware and intellectual property is delivered to the customer.    - 36 -         Systems.  System sales consist of a suite of products (some of which are sold separately) that enable gaming entities to track customer gaming activity, account for slot machine activity and operate progressive jackpot systems. There are proprietary hardware and software components to the systems. The Company accounts for system sales in accordance with Statement of Position 97- 2 - Software Revenue Recognition (SOP 97-2). System sales are considered multiple element arrangements because they include hardware, software, installation, training and post-sale customer support. System sales are evidenced by a signed contract. Follow-up spare parts and hardware-only sales are evidenced by a purchase order. Revenue for system sales is recognized when: (i) there is a signed contract with a fixed determinable price; (ii) collectibility of the sale is probable; and (iii) the hardware and software have been delivered, installed, training has been completed and acceptance has occurred. Not all systems contracts require installation. Examples include sales of hardware only to (i) previous customers that are expanding their systems, (ii) customers that have multiple locations and do the installation themselves and require an additional software license and hardware and (iii) customers purchasing spare parts.   Postcontract Customer Support.  Maintenance and support for all of our products are sold under agreements with established vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value in accordance with the applicable accounting literature. These contracts are generally for a period of three years and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract service period. Further training is also sold under agreements with established vendor-specific objective evidence of price, which is based on daily rates and is recognized upon delivery.   License Arrangements .  A significant portion of our revenues are generated from the license of intellectual property, software and game content. These licenses are sold on a stand-alone basis or in multiple element arrangements. We recognize revenues from these transactions in accordance with the applicable accounting literature. Revenues under perpetual license arrangements are generally recognized when the license is delivered. Revenues under fixed term arrangements are generally recognized over the term of the arrangement or in a manner consistent with the earnings process. For arrangements with multiple deliverables, revenue is generally recognized as the elements are delivered so long as the undelivered elements have established fair values as required in the applicable accounting literature.   Interior Signage.  Product sales are executed by a signed contract or customer purchase order. Revenue is recognized when the completed product is delivered. If the agreement calls for the Company to perform an installation after delivery, revenue related to the installation is recognized when the installation has been completed and accepted by the customer.   Inventory and Obsolescence     We routinely evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, estimated service period, product end of life dates, estimated current and future market values, service inventory requirements and new product introductions, as well as other factors. Purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure. Raw materials and work in progress with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed at least quarterly by our engineering and operating personnel for obsolescence. Such raw material and work in progress write-downs are typically caused by engineering change orders or product end of life adjustments. Finished goods are reviewed at least quarterly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices. Service inventory is systematically reserved for based on the estimated remaining service life of the inventory. We record reserves for inventory based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand in our analysis. In 2005 and 2004, we reduced our reserves through write-offs of obsolete inventories and adjusted the level of reserves in accordance with our accounting policies. If circumstances related to our inventories change, our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change.   Long-Lived Asset Impairment     Long-lived assets and intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment quarterly or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. We evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expected the assets to generate. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources in the future, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets.   For indefinite-lived assets including perpetual licenses and goodwill, an independent valuation is performed at least annually to determine if any impairment has occurred.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards     In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costsan amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. The amendment clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The guidance is effective for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2006. We believe that the adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact to our overall results of operations or financial position.   In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) that establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that is based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. The primary focus of this pronouncement is on issuing share-based payments for services provided by employees. This pronouncement also requires recognition of compensation expense for new equity instruments awarded or for modifications, cancellations or repurchases of existing awards starting January 1, 2006. Compensation expense for new equity awards, in most cases, will be based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant and will be recognized over the vesting service period. An award of a liability instrument, as defined by this pronouncement, will initially be recorded at fair value and will be adjusted each reporting period to the new fair value through the date of settlement. Additionally, in March 2005, the SEC issued SAB 107,  Share-Based Payment,  providing interpretive guidance on SFAS 123R valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS 123R with existing SEC guidance. SAB 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense to the same financial statement line item as cash compensation, and therefore, may impact cost of sales and service, related gross profits and margins, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. As a public company, we are allowed to select from two alternative transition methods, each having different reporting implications. While management has not yet completed its evaluation of this statement, the adoption of this statement is expected to have a material negative impact on our results of operations. However, due to the non-cash nature of stock option expense, we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have an impact on our cash flows.   In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-1, Application of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified   - 37 -        Production Activities provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP No. 109-1). FSP No. 109-1 states that the qualified production activities deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with SFAS No. 109. This statement was effective upon issuance. The adoption of this statement had no material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.   In December 2004, the FASB reached unanimous consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share. EITF 04-8 requires that the dilutive effect of outstanding contingent convertible notes shares be included in diluted earnings per share calculation, regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent conversion feature has been met. Since the Company currently has no outstanding contingent convertible debt, the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our overall results of operations or financial position.   In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections  a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 changes the requirement for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and guidance for retrospective application of a change in accounting principle. The statement also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization or depletion method for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. The statement carries forward, without change, the guidance contained in APB Opinion No. 20 for reporting the correction of errors in previously issued financial statements and changes in accounting estimates. The provisions of SFAS 154 will be effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material impact on our results of operations or consolidated financial position.      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     Market Risk    Foreign Currency Risk     There are two types of foreign currency exchange risks that a company may be subject to: transaction and translation gains or losses. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are distinguished from translation gains or losses as follows: (i) translation adjustments do not involve the movement of cash, they are accounting conversion calculations of an existing functional currency to a reporting currency and (ii) transaction gain or losses, however, are based on an actual transaction that requires formal payment at a future point in time.   We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk relating to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries asset, liability, income and expense accounts. Our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at the end of the relevant period. The income and expense accounts are translated using the average rate of exchange during the relevant period. Due to the long-term nature of our investment in our foreign operations, most of our intercompany transactions and translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component in stockholders equity. Although we do not regularly incur gains or losses from specific foreign currency transactions and do not believe that these amounts would be material, these gains and losses would be reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we did not have any forwards, options or other derivative contracts in force. We do not consider our existing foreign currency translation exposure to be material.   Interest Rate Risk     We have total interest-bearing debt of approximately $45.3 million before discounts. The components of this amount have fixed rates of interest and therefore, we do not have exposure to the fluctuation of market interest rates.   Any future borrowings will be exposed to market rate risk. We periodically review our interest rate exposure, if any, on our long-term debt and, as market conditions warrant, we may enter into an interest rate cap or swap agreements in order to manage this exposure. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we did not have any agreements in force. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   - 38 -           Item 8.
