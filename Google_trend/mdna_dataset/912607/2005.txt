ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     The following discussion reviews our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere herein.   The following discussion includes Forward-Looking Statements. The accuracy of such statements depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations. Certain of these factors are discussed under  Description of Business  Factors Influencing Future Results and Accuracy of Forward-Looking Statements  included in Item 1 of this report.   Summary of Critical Accounting Policies    The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Companys financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.   Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Companys critical accounting policies are described below.   Revenue Recognition    Revenues from the Companys Car and Truck Wash Segment are recognized, net of customer coupon discounts, when services are rendered or fuel or merchandise is sold. The Company records a liability for gift certificates, ticket books, and seasonal and annual passes sold at its car care locations but not yet redeemed. The Company estimates these unredeemed amounts based on gift certificate and ticket book sales and redemptions throughout the year as well as utilizing historical sales and tracking of redemption rates per the car washes point-of-sale systems. Seasonal and annual passes are amortized on a straight-line basis over the time during which the passes are valid.   Revenues from the Companys Security Segment are recognized when shipments are made, or for export sales when title has passed. Shipping and handling charges billed are included in revenues; the cost of which is included in SG&A expenses.   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets    In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , we periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used, and assets to be disposed of, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. If significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets, rather than a single asset. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for information regarding impairment charges incurred with respect to our truck wash operations.    21          Goodwill     In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company completed annual impairment tests as of November 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, and will be subject to an impairment test each year thereafter and whenever there is an impairment indicator. The Companys annual impairment testing corresponds with the Companys determination of its annual operating budgets for the upcoming year. The Companys valuation of goodwill is based on a discounted cash flow model applying an appropriate discount rate to future expected cash flows and managements annual review of historical data and future assessment of certain critical operating factors, including, car wash volumes, average car wash and detailing revenue rates per car, wash and detailing labor cost percentages, weather trends and recent and expected operating cost levels. Estimating cash flows requires significant judgment including factors beyond our control and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Weather, particularly in our Northeast and Texas regions, continues to negatively influence our operating results. This negative influence continues to affect our future cash flow assumptions during our annual goodwill impairment testing resulting in further goodwill impairment charges in 2004 as part of our November 30, 2004 annual testing. See Note 3 of the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for information regarding impairment charges incurred with respect to our Northeast and Texas reporting units. Adverse business conditions could affect recoverability of goodwill in the future and accordingly, the Company may record additional impairments in subsequent years.   Other Intangible Assets    Other intangible assets consist primarily of deferred financing costs, customer lists, product lists, trademarks, and a registered national brand name. In accordance with SFAS 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , our trademarks and brand name are considered to have indefinite lives, and as such, are not subject to amortization. These assets are tested for impairment using discounted cash flow methodology annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Several impairment indicators are beyond our control, and cannot be predicted with any certainty whether or not they will occur. Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective debt instruments. Customer lists, product lists, and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.   Income Taxes    Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) represents the change during the period in the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities. Deferred income tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.   Supplementary Cash Flow Information    Interest paid on all indebtedness was approximately $2.0 million, $2.0 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively. Income taxes paid were approximately $340,000, $144,000, and $169,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Noncash investing and financing activities of the Company excluded from the statement of cash flows include a property addition financed by common stock of $1.6 million, real estate partially funded by a mortgage of approximately $825,000, and the sale of property and simultaneous pay down of a related mortgage of $325,000, all in 2004 and property additions financed by debt of $343,000 and $1.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.   Introduction     Revenues           Car and Truck Wash Services    We own full service, exterior only and self-service car wash locations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Texas, Florida and Arizona, as well as truck washes in Arizona, Indiana, Ohio and Texas. We earn revenues from washing and detailing automobiles; performing oil and lubrication services, minor auto repairs, and state inspections; selling fuel; and selling merchandise through convenience stores within the car wash facilities. Revenues generated for 2004 for the Car and Truck Wash Segment were comprised of approximately 81% from car washing and detailing, 9% from lube and other automotive services, and 10% from fuel and merchandise. The majority of revenues from our Car and Truck Wash Segment are collected in the form of cash or credit   22           card receipts, thus minimizing customer accounts receivable.   Weather has had and continues to have a significant impact on volume, and therefore revenue, at the individual locations. We believe that the geographic diversity of our operating locations in different regions of the country helps mitigate the risk and impact of adverse weather-related influence on our volume.         Security    Our Security Segment designs, manufactures, markets and sells a wide range of products. The Companys primary focus in the Security Segment is the design of digital video surveillance systems and components that it produces and sells, primarily to installing dealers, system integrators and end users. A video system is typically a private network that can transmit and receive video, audio and data signals. Other products in our Security Segment are less-than-lethal defense sprays and other security devices such as biometric locks and plasma monitors. The main marketing channels for our products are industry shows, catalogs, internet, sales through a call center and sales through mass merchants and trade publications. Prior to 2002, this segments main business was the production and sale of less-than-lethal defense sprays.   Cost of Revenues           Car and Truck Wash Services    Cost of revenues consists primarily of direct labor and related taxes and benefits, certain insurance costs, chemicals, wash and detailing supplies, rent, real estate taxes, utilities, car damages, maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities, as well as the cost of the fuel and merchandise sold.         Security    Cost of revenues within the Security Segment consists primarily of costs to purchase or manufacture the security products including direct labor and related taxes and benefits, and raw material costs. Product warranty costs related to the electronic security surveillance products business have been minimal in that the majority of customer product warranty claims are reimbursed by the supplier.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist primarily of management, clerical and administrative salaries, professional services, insurance premiums, sales commissions, and other costs relating to marketing and sales.   We capitalize direct incremental costs associated with acquisitions. Indirect acquisition costs, such as executive salaries, corporate overhead, public relations, and other corporate services and overhead are expensed as incurred.   Depreciation and Amortization     Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of buildings and equipment, and amortization of certain intangible assets. Buildings and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Intangible assets, other than goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, are amortized over their useful lives ranging from three to 15 years, using the straight-line method.   Costs of Terminated Acquisitions     Our policy is to charge as an expense any previously capitalized expenditures relating to proposed acquisitions that in our current opinion will not be consummated. At December 31, 2004, there were no capitalized costs related directly to proposed acquisitions that were not yet consummated. We periodically review the future likelihood of these acquisitions and record appropriate provisions against capitalized costs associated with projects that are not likely to be completed.   23           Goodwill and Asset Impairment Charges     In accordance with SFAS 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , we periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used, and assets to be disposed of, for possible impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we wrote down assets determined to be impaired by approximately $1.2 million. The asset write-down related to one of our full service car wash sites in Texas and two full service car wash sites in Arizona. We have determined that due to changing demographics and increased competition in the geographic areas of these sites, their future expected cash flows will not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values. During the quarter ended June 30, 2003, we further wrote down the assets related to one of the full service car wash sites in Arizona, which we partially wrote down at December 31, 2002, by an additional $351,000. The additional write-down was the result of the impending loss of a significant customer of this site resulting in an additional reduction of the future expected cash flows of this site and the ability to recover the sites carrying value. We closed the facility effective September 30, 2003. During the quarter ended June 30, 2004, we sold the other Arizona car wash site recording a loss of $51,000 on the disposition. We continue to market the Texas site for sale and have written down these assets to their estimated fair market values. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2004, we wrote down assets related to our truck wash operations determined to be impaired by approximately $500,000. We have determined that due to a reduction in truck wash volumes resulting from an increase in inclement weather, increased competition, the significant increase in fuel costs which had the effect of reducing spending on truck washing, and demographic changes to certain of our facilities, their future expected cash flows would not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values.   In accordance with SFAS 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,  we perform the annual impairment testing of Goodwill and Other Intangibles as of November 30 each year which corresponds with the Companys determination of its annual operating budgets for the upcoming year. Our valuation of goodwill is based on a discounted cash flow model applying an appropriate discount rate to future expected cash flows and managements annual review of historical data and future assessment of certain critical operating factors, including, car wash volumes, average car wash and detailing revenue rates per car, wash and detailing labor cost percentages, weather trends and recent and expected operating cost levels. In the fourth quarter of 2003, as a result of the annual impairment test of Goodwill and Other Intangibles in accordance with SFAS 142, we recorded an impairment of approximately $3.4 million related to our Northeast region reporting unit of our Car and Truck Wash Segment. This was principally due to a reduction in future projected cash flow as determined during our 2004 budgeting process, which we undertook in November, 2003. The projection of cash flow from the Northeast region reporting unit was reduced because fewer cars were washed in 2003 than we had projected in November 2002 for 2003. We projected our car wash volume for 2003 based on the number of cars washed in the Northeast region reporting unit in the previous four years. We believe that fewer cars were actually washed during 2003 as a result of more inclement weather than in 2002 and a slower economy. In the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the annual impairment test of Goodwill and Other Intangibles in accordance with SFAS 142, we recorded an impairment of approximately $1.0 million related to our Northeast region reporting unit of our Car and Truck Wash Segment. Additionally, we recorded an impairment of approximately $6.7 million related to our Texas region reporting unit of our Car and Truck Wash Segment. These impairments were principally due to reductions in future projected cash flows as determined during our 2005 budgeting process, which we completed in December, 2004. The projections of cash flows from these reporting units were reduced because of two successive years of reductions in number of cars washed. We projected our car wash volume for 2004 based on the number of cars washed in these reporting units in the previous five years. We believe that fewer cars were actually washed during 2004 as a result of more inclement weather than in 2003, and increased competition near certain of our facilities in Texas and New Jersey.   In 2002, the income tax benefit related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was recorded at an effective tax rate of 36% for the impairments in the Arizona and Truck Wash reporting units. In 2004, the income tax benefit related to the Texas regions goodwill impairment was recorded at an effective tax rate of 36%. No income tax benefit was recorded for the Northeast region reporting units impairment due to the non-deductibility of the goodwill. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year primarily due to state and local income taxes, non-deductible costs related to intangibles, fixed asset adjustments, and changes to the valuation allowance.   24           Other Income     Other income consists primarily of rental income received on renting out excess space at our car wash facilities and includes gains and losses on the sale of property and equipment.   Results of Operations for Each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2004     The following table presents the percentage each item in the consolidated statements of operations bears to total revenues:                                                                                     Year ended December 31,                     2004              2003              2002              Revenues              100.0    %              100.0    %              100.0    %      Cost of revenues              73.0                   73.1                   71.3           Selling, general and administrative expenses              21.9                   19.4                   18.0           Depreciation and amortization              4.3                   4.0                   4.2           Costs of terminated acquisitions              0.1                                      0.1           Goodwill and asset impairment charges              14.3                   7.7                   2.5                                                               Operating (loss) income              (13.6    )              (4.2    )              3.9           Interest expense, net              (3.3    )              (4.0    )              (4.8    )      Other income              0.5                   0.9                   0.7                                                                Loss from continuing operations before income taxes              (16.4    )              (7.3    )              (0.2    )      Income tax benefit              (5.3    )              (0.1    )              (0.1    )                                                          Loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle              (11.1    )              (7.2    )              (0.1    )      Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax benefit                                                    (12.3    )                                                          Net loss              (11.1    )%              (7.2    )%              (12.4    )%                                                            Revenues           Car and Truck Wash Services    Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $41.0 million as compared to $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $2.4 million or 5.5%. Of the $41.0 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, $33.4 million or 81% was generated from car wash and detailing, $3.5 million or 9% from lube and other automotive services, and $4.1 million or 10% from fuel and merchandise sales. Of the $43.4 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, $35.7 million or 82% was generated from car wash and detailing, $4.1 million or 10% from lube and other automotive services, and $3.6 million or 8% from fuel and merchandise sales. The decrease in wash and detailing revenues was principally due to an overall car wash volume decline of 10.2% in 2004 from 2003, including 3.9% from the closing or divesting of five car wash locations. Partially offsetting this decline in volume, the Company experienced an increase in average wash and detailing revenue per car to $15.14 in 2004, from $14.52 in 2003, a 4.3% increase. This increase in average wash and detailing revenue per car was the result of managements continued focus on aggressively selling detailing and additional on-line car wash services. Revenue from lube and other automotive serivces was approximately $3.5 million in 2004 compared to $4.1 million in 2003, a decrease of $0.6 million or 15%. This decrease in revenue, principally within our Texas region, is the result of the reduction in car wash volume within this market combined with increased competition.The increase in fuel and merchandise revenues is primarily the result of higher fuel prices and the addition of higher quality merchandise in our car wash lobbies. Management expects car wash volumes to increase as weather trends return to more historic levels of inclement weather resulting in an improvement in car wash and detailing revenue levels.   Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $43.4 million as compared to $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $0.7 million or 1.6%. Of the $43.4 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, $35.7 million  25         or 82% was generated from car wash and detailing, $4.1 million or 10% from lube and other automotive services, and $3.6 million or 8% from fuel and merchandise sales. Of the $44.1 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, $36.7 million or 83% was generated from car wash and detailing, $4.2 million or 10% from lube and other automotive services, and $3.2 million or 7% from fuel and merchandise sales. The decrease in wash and detailing revenues was principally due to closing or divesting of three of our car wash locations and a lube facility during 2003; the temporary closure of a car wash location in Arizona due to fire damage; a departure from historic revenue levels within the Northeast region due to several significant snow storms in the first quarter of 2003, an increase in inclement weather, particularly on weekends, within the Texas region and the impact of a slower economy. Overall car wash volumes declined 6.9% in 2003 from 2002, including 1.8% from the closing or divesting of the three car wash locations noted above. Partially offsetting this decline in volume, the Company experienced an increase in average wash and detailing revenue per car to $14.52 in 2003, from $13.89 in 2002. This increase in average wash and detailing revenue per car was the result of managements continued focus on aggressively selling detailing and additional on-line car wash services. The increase in fuel and merchandise revenues is the result of more aggressive pricing on fuel to attract traffic into our car wash facilities and the addition of higher quality merchandise in our car wash lobbies.         Security    Revenues of the Security Segment were approximately $16.6 million, $5.6 million and $2.5 million in 2004 and 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in revenues is due principally to internal growth in sales to security systems installers, $7.8 million of sales generated by IVS and S&M which we acquired in July of 2004, and sales growth in 2004 of $1.1 million generated by Vernex, which was acquired in September 2003. Management expects revenues to continue to increase in the electronic surveillance systems area as the Company expands its sales staff and marketing efforts. Pursuant to a Management Agreement, we earned $80,000 in 2002. This amount is included under revenues from operating agreements. Effective May 1, 2002, the Company recommenced operation of the Security Segment.   Cost of Revenues           Car and Truck Wash Services    Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $30.1 million or 73% of revenues with car washing and detailing costs at 71% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 78% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 87% of respective revenues. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $32.3 million, or 74% of revenues with car wash and detailing costs at 73% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 78% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 87% of respective revenues. The Company experienced a slight improvement in wash and detailing operating margins in 2004, despite a decrease in wash volume of 10.2% as compared to the prior year, as a result of a decline in insurance related claim costs, lease termination costs recorded in the prior year related to an underperforming car wash property closed in 2003, and the divestitive or closing of five unprofitable or marginally profitable car wash sites in 2003 and 2004. Additionally, due to managements emphasis on monitoring labor staffing on a daily basis, we were successful in maintaining relatively stable labor costs as a percent of revenues in 2004 and 2003 despite the decrease in volume.   Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $32.3 million or 74% of revenues with car washing and detailing costs at 73% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 77% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 87% of respective revenues. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $31.8 million, or 72% of revenues with car wash and detailing costs at 70% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 78% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 87% of respective revenues. In 2003, as compared to 2002, the Company experienced a deterioration in wash and detailing operating margins largely due to the decrease in wash volume of 6.9% as compared to the prior year, combined with increased insurance premiums and related claim costs, lease termination costs related to an underperforming car wash property closed in 2003, and an increase in labor costs as a percent of revenues of approximately two percentage points. This deterioration in wash and detailing operating margins was partially offset by certain temporary and permanent cost savings measures instituted in March of 2003, including reductions in payroll and related benefit costs, repairs and maintenance costs and certain other operating expenses.         Security    Cost of revenues were $12.0 million, or 72% of revenues, $3.5 million or 62% of revenues and $1.5 million or 61% of revenues for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For the first four months of 2002, pursuant to a Management Agreement, no costs were incurred by us. The increase in cost of revenues in 2004 is principally due to the growth in the sale of video surveillance systems and components which have gross profit margins typically lower than less-then-lethal defense sprays; an increase in sales of  26         monitors, which are typically sold at lower profit margins than other video system components; an increase in sales to larger distributors and system installers at lower profit margins to gain market share; and the acquisition of IVS and S&M with sales margins lower than the Companys previously existing security operations. Management does not expect the cost of revenues as a percent of revenues to increase substantially from current levels.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses     Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $12.6 million compared to $9.5 million for the same period in 2003, an increase of approximately $3.1 million or 33%. SG&A costs as a percent of revenues were 21.9% for 2004 as compared to 19.4% in 2003. The increase in SG&A costs is primarily the result of growth of the Security Segment, which added $2.5 million of SG&A costs in 2004, and an increase of $497,000 in Corporate SG&A costs. The SG&A cost increase in the Security Segment was comprised of $1.6 million related to the do it yourself video surveillance system business and the high end digital camera business acquired in July 2004 including $105,000 of transaction and integration costs as well as increases in costs of our existing Ft. Lauderdale, FL based video surveillance systems operation. These increases were in the areas of marketing and selling costs and administration personnel costs as additional staff was added to handle planned growth. Corporate cost increases related principally to increased insurance costs, the cost of settling a legal matter for $55,000, and a management bonus and increased corporate salaries totaling $298,000 in 2004. Management does not expect SG&A costs as a percent of revenues to substantailly increase in the future.   Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $9.5 million compared to $8.4 million for the same period in 2002, an increase of approximately $1.1 million or 13%. SG&A costs as a percent of revenues were 19.4% for 2003 as compared to 18.1% in 2002. The increase in SG&A costs is primarily the result of recommencing operation of the Security Segment in May 2002, which along with the growth in the video surveillance system and components operation added a combined $1.2 million of SG&A costs in 2003. The Company also incurred approximately $168,000 of legal fees through December 31, 2003 related to the investigation being conducted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. These increases in costs were partially offset by certain temporary and permanent cost saving measures initiated in March of 2003, including reductions in payroll and related benefit costs.   Depreciation and Amortization     Depreciation and amortization totaled $2.5 million, $2.0 million and $2.0 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an adjustment to reflect the appropriate balances for certain assets classified as buildings and leasehold improvements that had been depreciated using incorrect useful lives. Specifically, the Company recognized $338,000 in additional depreciation and amortization expense in its consolidated statement of operation for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 to correct the aforementioned error in accounting. We decided to record the correction in the current period and not restate our previously issued financial statements after taking into consideration (i) that the adjustment, net of applicable income taxes, did not have a material impact on the financial statements of prior interim or annual periods taken as a whole; and (ii) that the cumulative impact of the adjustment on stockholders equity was not material to the financial statements of prior interim or annual periods.   Costs of Terminated Acquisitions    Our policy is to charge as an expense any previously capitalized expenditures relating to proposed acquisitions that in our current opinion will not be consummated. The costs of previously capitalized expenditures related to proposed acquisitions totaled approximately $53,000, $0 and $57,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, repectively. These costs, which principally related to several possible acquisitions we pursued in the Security Segment, are primarily related to due diligence costs.   Asset Impairment Charges     In accordance with SFAS 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , we periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used, and assets to be disposed of, for possible impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value, net of costs to sell. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we wrote down assets determined to be impaired by approximately $1.2 million. The asset write-down related to one of our full service car wash sites in Texas and two full service car wash sites in Arizona. We have determined that due to changing demographics and increased competition in the geographic areas of these sites, their future expected cash flows will not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values. During the quarter ended June 30, 2003, we further wrote down the assets related to one of the full service car wash sites in Arizona, which we partially wrote down at December 31, 2002, by an additional $351,000. The additional write-down was the result of the impending loss of a significant customer of this site resulting in an additional reduction of the future expected cash flows of this site and the ability to recover the sites carrying value. We closed the facility effective September 30, 2003. During the quarter ended June 30, 2004, we sold the other Arizona car wash site recording a loss of $51,000 on the disposition. We continue to market the Texas site for sale and have written down these assets to their estimated fair market values. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2004, we wrote down assets related to our truck wash operations determined to be impaired by approximately $500,000. We have determined that due to a reduction in truck wash volumes resulting from an increase in inclement weather, increased competition, the significant increase in fuel costs which had the effect of reducing spending on truck washing, and demographic changes to certain of our facilities, their future expected cash flows would not be sufficient to recover their respective  27         carrying values.   In the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the annual impairment test of Goodwill and Other Intangibles in accordance with SFAS 142, we recorded impairments of approximately $1.0 million and $6.7 million related to our Northeast and Texas reporting units, respectively. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded an impairment of approximately $3.4 million related to our Northeast region reporting unit of our Car and Truck Wash Segment.These 2004 and 2003 impairments were principally due to reductions in future projected cash flows resulting from extended departures from our historic revenue levels as a result of inclement weather, and increased competition near several of our facilities in Texas and New Jersey.   Interest Expense, Net     Interest expense, net of interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2004, was $1.9 million compared to $2.0 million for 2003. This decrease in our interest expense was the result of a reduction in our outstanding debt as a result of routine monthly principal payments, partially offset by an increase in interest rates in the last quarter of 2004 on approximately 50% of our long-term debt which has interest rates tied to the prime rate.   Interest expense, net of interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $2.0 million compared to $2.2 million for 2002. This decrease in our interest expense was the result of a decrease in interest rates on approximately 50% of our long-term debt which has interest rates tied to the prime rate and a reduction in our outstanding debt as a result of routine monthly principal payments.   Other Income     Other income was $267,000, $438,000, and $327,000 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Included in 2003 is a $107,000 gain on the sale of a car wash facility in our Northeast region.   Income Taxes     We recorded income tax benefits of $3.0 million, $50,000, and $32,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Income tax benefit reflects the recording of income taxes on loss before income taxes at effective rates of approximately 32%, 1%, and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. In 2004 and 2003 no income tax benefit was recorded on the Northeast region reporting unit goodwill impairments of approximately $1.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively, due to the non-deductibility of the goodwill. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year primarily due to state and local income taxes, non-deductible costs related to intangibles, fixed asset adjustments and changes to the valuation allowance.   In 2002, we recorded an income tax benefit related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately $2.2 million which reflects an effective rate of 36% for the impairment in the Arizona and truck wash reporting units. No income tax benefit was recorded for the Northeast region reporting unit goodwill impairment due to the non-deductibility of the goodwill.   At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $16.0 million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. Components of the net operating loss carryforwards include $14.8 million from continuing operations and $1.2 million from acquired net operating losses attributable to the acquisition of Colonial Full Service Car Wash, Inc.   Liquidity and Capital Resources           Liquidity    Cash and cash equivalents were $14.5 million at December 31, 2004. The ratio of our total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt plus stockholders equity, was 30.5% at December 31, 2004, and 37% at December 31, 2003. The improvements in the Companys cash position and total debt to total capitalization ratio are directly related to equity infusions as noted below.   Our business requires a substantial amount of capital, most notably to pursue our expansion strategies, including our current expansion in the Security Segment, and for equipment purchases and upgrades for our Car and Truck Wash Segment. We plan to meet these capital needs from various financing sources, including borrowings, internally generated funds, and the issuance of common stock if the market price of the Companys stock is at a desirable level.   As of December 31, 2004, we had working capital of approximately $17.5 million. At December 31, 2003, working capital was  28         approximately $270,000. The significant improvement in working capital at December 31, 2004 is primarily attributable to: 1) $8.95 million of proceeds received from the removal of a restriction on outstanding shares of the Companys common stock; 2) $9.4 million of proceeds, net of issuance costs, from the sale of approximately 1.9 million shares of the Companys common stock to two private institutions through three seperate sale transactions and the sale of 150,000 shares of the Companys stock to Fusion under a Master Facility Agreement; 3) $1.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options; and 4) $795,000 of proceeds from the sale of an exterior-only car wash in New Jersey and a full-service car wash in Arizona. Working capital was also positively affected by the renewal and reclassification to non-current liabilities of approximately $3.3 million of 15-year amortizing loans with Bank One. The increase in working capital was partially offset by the use of $5.6 million of cash for the acquisitions of IVS and S&M on July 1, 2004; capital expenditure investments for further growth within the Car and Truck Wash Segment and the Security Segment, as more fully detailed below; and the reclassification to current liabilities of an additional loan for $290,000 which is up for renewal in April 2005. The Company intends to renew this loan with the current lender. Although the Company has been successful in renewing similar loans with the current lender in the past, including the renewal of loans in 2004 and 2003 totaling $3.3 million and $6.4 million, respectively, there can be no assurance that our lender will continue to provide us with renewals or with renewals at favorable terms.   During the year ending December 31, 2004 and 2003, we made capital expenditures of $1.46 million and $872,000, respectively, within our Car and Truck Wash Segment. We estimate aggregate capital expenditures for our Car and Truck Wash Segment, exclusive of acquisitions of businesses, of approximately $1.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2005. The Company believes its current cash balance at December 31, 2004 of $14.5 million and cash flow from operating activities in the remainder of 2005 will be sufficient to meet its car wash capital expenditure funding needs through at least the next twelve months. In years subsequent to 2005, we estimate that our Car and Truck Wash Segment will require annual capital expenditures of $750,000 to $1.25 million. Capital expenditures within our Car and Truck Wash Segment are necessary to maintain the efficiency and competitiveness of our sites. If the cash provided from operating activities does not improve in 2005 and future years and if current cash balances are depleted, we will need to raise additional capital to meet these ongoing capital requirements.   We have spent approximately $4.9 million through June 30, 2004 in developing our video surveillance systems operations in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. including the acquisition costs of Micro-Tech and Vernex and the cost of developing and purchasing inventory for our expanded product line. Additionally, on July 1, 2004 the Company paid approximately $5.6 million of cash for the acquisition of the S&M and IVS security operations. We also made capital expenditures of approximately $1.9 million for the purchase and furnishing of a new facility in Farmers Branch, Texas for our newly acquired S&M and IVS security operations. Approximately $825,000 of the Farmers Branch, Texas facility purchase price was financed. We estimate capital expenditures for the Security Segment at approximately $150,000 for 2005, principally related to improvements and equipment for the new facilities in Farmers Branch, Texas and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.   We intend to continue to expend significant cash for the purchasing of inventory as we grow and introduce new video surveillance products in 2005 and in years subsequent to 2005. We anticipate that inventory purchases will be funded from cash collected from sales and working capital. At December 31, 2004, we maintained an unused $500,000 revolving credit facility with Bank One to provide financing for additional video surveillance product inventory purchases. This revolving credit facility is subject to an availability calculation based on inventory and accounts receivable (as defined in our bank agreement). Based upon availability calculations at December 31, 2004, the full amount of the revolving credit facility is currently available. The amount of capital that we will spend in 2005 and in years subsequent to 2005 is largely dependent on the marketing success we achieve with our video surveillance systems and components. We believe our cash balance of $14.5 million at December 31, 2004 and the revolving credit facility will provide for growth in 2005. Unless our operating cash flow improves, our growth will be limited if we deplete our cash balance.   In the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing by selling common stock and obtaining mortgage loans. Our ability to obtain new financing can be adversely impacted by our stock price. Our failure to maintain the required current debt service coverage ratios on existing loans also adversely impacts our ability to obtain additional financing. We are reluctant to sell common stock at market prices below our per share book value. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2004 we would have been in default on certain of our debt covenants had we not obtained waivers. Our ability to obtain new financing will be limited if our stock price is not above our per share book value and our cash from operating activities does not improve. Currently, we cannot incur additional long term debt without the approval of one of our commercial lenders. The Company must demonstrate that the cash flow benefit from the use of new loan proceeds exceeds the resulting future debt service requirements.   Debt Capitalization and Other Financing Arrangements    At December 31, 2004, we had borrowings, including capital lease obligations, of approximately $29.2 million. We had three letters  29         of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004, totaling $908,000 as collateral relating to workers compensation insurance policies. We maintain a $500,000 revolving credit facility, subject to an availability calculation based on inventory and accounts receivable, to provide financing for additional video surveillance product inventory purchases. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004. The Company also maintains a $600,000 line of credit for commerical letters of credit for the importation of inventory. There were no outstanding commerical letters of credit under this commitment at December 31, 2004.   Several of our debt agreements, as amended, contain certain affirmative and negative covenants and require the maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth, maintenance of certain unencumbered cash and marketable securities balances, limitations on capital spending and the maintenance of certain debt service coverage ratios on a consolidated level.   At December 31, 2004, we were not in compliance with our semi-annual consolidated debt coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 related to our GMAC notes payable. The Companys debt coverage ratio related to the GMAC notes payable was .92:1 at December 31, 2004. GMAC granted us a waiver of acceleration related to the non-compliance with the debt coverage ratio covenant at December 31, 2004, and for measurement periods through January 1, 2006 and, accordingly, a portion of the GMAC notes payable was reflected as non-current on our financial statements at December 31, 2004. If we are not able to increase our debt coverage ratio to at least 1.25:1, or we cannot obtain further waivers of acceleration, the GMAC notes may be reflected as current in future balance sheets and as a result our stock price may decline.   The Company has entered into amendments to the Bank One term loan agreements effective March 31, 2004. The amended debt coverage ratio with Bank One requires the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization to debt service of 1.05:1 at December 31, 2004 and thereafter. The Companys debt coverage ratio was .89:1 at December 31, 2004, which was not in compliance with this Bank One covenant as amended. The Company received a waiver of acceleration with respect to this debt coverage ratio from Bank One through January 1, 2006 and, accordingly, a portion of the Bank One notes payable was reflected as non-current on our financial statements at December 31, 2004. The Bank One amendment also requires the maintenance of a minimum total unencumbered cash and marketable securities balance of $5 million. This cash balance requirement will be lowered to $1 million upon the Company returning to a debt coverage ratio of at least 1.10 to 1. If we are unable to satisfy these covenants or obtain further waivers, the Bank One notes may be reflected as current in future balance sheets and as a result our stock price may decline.   The Company sold or closed five unprofitable or marginally profitable car wash facilities and a lube facility in 2003 and 2004 and increased its prices in March 2004 within the Car and Truck Wash Segment to help improve cash flows for fiscal 2004. If our future cash flows are less than expected or debt service including interest expense increases more than expected causing us to further default on any of the Bank One covenants or the GMAC covenant in the future, the Company will need to obtain further amendments or waivers from these lenders. If the Company is unable to obtain waivers or amendments in the future, Bank One debt currently totaling $14.5 million and GMAC debt currently totaling $10.6 million, including debt recorded as long-term debt at December 31, 2004, would become payable on demand by the financial institution upon expiration of the current waivers.   The Companys ongoing ability to comply with its debt covenants under its credit arrangements and refinance its debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow. Our cash flow has been and could continue to be adversely affected by weather patterns, economic conditions, and the requirements to fund the growth of our security business. In the event that non-compliance with the debt covenants should reoccur, the Company would pursue various alternatives to attempt to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments, or refinancing debt with other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that further debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained or that the debt would be refinanced with other financial institutions at favorable terms. If we are unable to obtain renewals on maturing loans or refinancing of loans on favorable terms, our ability to operate would be materially and adversely affected.   The Company is obligated under various operating leases, primarily for certain equipment and real estate within the Car and Truck Wash Segment. Certain of these leases contain purchase options, renewal provisions, and contingent rentals for our proportionate share of taxes, utilities, insurance, and annual cost of living increases.   30           The following are summaries of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at December 31, 2004 (in thousands):                                                                                                                             Payments Due By Period                                         Less than              Two to              Four to Five              More Than           Contractual Obligations(1)         Total              One Year              Three Years              Years              Five Years              Long-term debt (2)         $    29,021              $    2,541              $    5,137              $    13,542              $    7,801           Capital leases (2)              174                   93                   81                                                 Minimum operating lease payments              4,212                   1,093                   1,371                   815                   933                                                                                                       $    33,407              $    3,727              $    6,589              $    14,357              $    8,734                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Amounts Expiring Per Period                                         Less Than              Two to              Four to Five              More Than           Other Commercial Commitments         Total              One Year              Three Years              Years              Five Years              Line of credit(3)         $    500              $    500              $                  $                  $               Standby letters of credit(4)              908                   908                                                                                                                                                                $    1,408              $    1,408              $                  $                  $                                                                                                            (1)         Potential amounts for inventory ordered under purchase orders are not reflected in the amounts above as they are typically cancelable prior to delivery and, if purchased, would be sold within the normal business cycle.           (2)         Related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule. Our interest payments for the next twelve month period, based on current market rates, are expected to be approximately $1.9 million.           (3)         There were no borrowings outstanding under the Companys line of credit at December 31, 2004.           (4)         The Company also maintains a $600,000 line of credit for commerical letters of credit for the importation of inventory. There were no outstanding commerical letters of credit under this commitment at December 31, 2004. Outstanding letters of credit of $908,000 represent collateral for workers compensation insurance policies        Mace currently employs Louis D. Paolino, Jr. as its President and Chief Executive Officer under a three-year employment agreement dated August 12, 2003. The principal terms of the employment agreement include: an annual salary of $400,000; a car at a lease cost of $1,500 per month: provision for certain medical and other employee benefits; prohibition against competing with Mace during employment and for a three-month period following a termination of employment; and a $2.5 million payment in the event that Mr. Paolinos employment is terminated for certain reasons set forth in the employment agreement. The termination payment is not due in the event of termination due to death or disability or certain prohibited conduct, as more fully set forth in the employment agreement. The termination payment is due if Mr. Paolino is terminated for unsatisfactory job performance. The employment agreement also entitles Mr. Paolino to a $2.5 million change-of-control bonus.   The Master Facility Agreement between the Company and Fusion Capital Fund II, LLC (Fusion) and the Equity Purchase Agreement between the Company and Fusion has been terminated. Under the Master Facility Agreement, the Company had entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement on April 17, 2000. Under the Equity Purchase Agreement, Fusion had the right and obligation to purchase up to $10 million of the Companys common stock under certain conditions. On April 21, 2004, the Company and Fusion entered into a termination and release agreement under which the Company sold Fusion 150,000 registered shares of the Companys common stock at $2.32 per share and terminated the Equity Purchase Agreement.         Cash Flows    Operating Activities.  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $137,000 in 2003. The Company generated approximately $147,000 in cash from working capital accounts. The cash generated from working capital was mainly due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. This was partially offset by growth in the Companys inventory of approximately $1.4 million from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. The increase in inventory was  31         due primarily to growth within our existing Ft. Lauderdale, Florida and recently acquired Farmers Branch, Texas video surveillance systems and components operations. The Company also incurred $2.5 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense.   Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $137,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The reduction in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was pricipally due to an increased net loss from operations in 2003 and a decrease in cash generated from the changes in working capital accounts of $2.3 million. The decrease in cash generated from working capital is mainly attributed to an increase in the Companys inventory and accounts receivable totaling $1.95 million, due primarily to the increase in inventory and accounts receivable related to the growth and expansion of the Companys Security Segment. The increase in the loss from operations is mainly due to the expansion of the Security Segment and the effect of increased inclement weather, especially in the Northeast and Texas regions, together with a slower economy, which negatively affected the Companys car count.   Investing Activities . Cash used in investing activities totaled $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 which includes $5.6 million for the July 1, 2004 acquisition of IVS and S&M, $1.5 million for capital expenditures relating to ongoing car care operations, and $1.4 million for capital expenditures relating to the Security Segment. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds of approximately $795,000 received from the sale of an exterior-only car wash in New Jersey and a full-service car wash in Arizona. Cash used in investing activities totaled $569,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 which includes $873,000 for capital expenditures relating to ongoing car care operations, and $234,000 for the Security Segment. These amounts were partially offset by $598,000 of cash proceeds from the sale of a car wash facility in our Northeast region.   Financing Activities . Cash provided by financing activities was $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 which includes $11.3 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options and $8.95 million of proceeds from the removal of restrictions on shares, partially offset by routine principal payments on debt of $2.6 million. Cash used in financing activities was $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 which was pricipally for routine principal payments on debt.   Seasonality and Inflation    The Company believes that its car washing and detailing operations are adversely affected by periods of inclement weather. In particular, long periods of rain and cloudy weather adversely affects our car wash volumes and related lube and other automotive services as people typically do not wash their cars during such periods. Additionally, extended periods of warm, dry weather, usually encountered during the Companys third quarter, may encourage customers to wash their cars themselves which also can adversely affect our car wash business. The Company has attempted to mitigate the risk of unfavorable weather patterns by having operations in diverse geographic regions. The Company also experiences a seasonal reduction in volume during the third quarter within the Companys Arizona and Florida regions as a result of a migration of a significant portion of those areas populations to cooler climates.   The Company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the near future.     ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS     We are not materially exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices.   Interest Rate Exposure    A significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates, and as such, changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results unless and until such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity. Substantially all of our variable rate debt obligations are tied to the prime rate, as is our incremental borrowing rate. A one percent increase in the prime and Libor rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2004 and would have had the impact of increasing interest expense by approximately $170,000 in 2004.   On October 14, 2004, we entered into an interest rate cap that effectively changes our interest rate exposure on approximately $7 million of variable rate debt. The variable rate debt floats at prime plus .25% (5.5% at December 31, 2004). The hedge contract has a 36-month term and caps the interest rate on the $7 million of variable rate debt at 6.5%. The derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and, accordingly, is marked to market with gains and losses on the contract reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and is classified into earnings in the earlier of (i) the period the hedged transaction affects earnings, or (ii) the  32           termination of the hedge contract. At December 31, 2004 the contract which was originally purchased for $124,000, is included in other assets, at its fair market value of approximately $79,000.     ITEM 8.
