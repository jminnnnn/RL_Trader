ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion reviews our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere herein.  The following discussion includes Forward Looking Statements. The accuracy of such statements depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations. Certain of these factors are discussed under Description of Business -- Factors Influencing Future Results and Accuracy of Forward-Looking Statements included in Item 1 of this report.  Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company's financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company's critical accounting policies are described below.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue from the Company's Car Care segment is recognized, net of customer coupon discounts, when services are rendered or fuel or merchandise is sold. The Company records a liability for gift certificates and ticket books sold at its car care locations but not yet redeemed. The Company estimates these unredeemed amounts based on gift certificates and ticket book sales and redemptions throughout the year as well as utilizing historical sales and redemption rates.  Revenue from the Company's Security Products Segment is recognized when shipments are made, or for export sales when title has passed.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method for security and car care products. Inventories at the Company's Car Care locations consist of various chemicals and cleaning supplies used in operations and merchandise and fuel for resale to consumers. Inventories within the Company's Security Products segment consist of defense sprays, child safety products, electronic security monitors, cameras and digital recorders, and various other consumer security and safety products.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  In accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment on a reporting unit basis using undiscounted                                         18    after-tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect to one full service car wash site in our Texas region and two in our Arizona region.  Goodwill  Prior to 2002, goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over 25 years.  On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142, and as required, discontinued amortization of goodwill acquired prior to July 1, 2001. Additionally, SFAS 142 required that, within six months of adoption, the first phase of the goodwill transitional impairment testing be completed at the reporting unit level as of the date of adoption. SFAS 142 requires that any goodwill impairment loss recognized as a result of initial application be reported in the first interim period of adoption as a change in accounting principle and that the income per share effects of the accounting change be separately disclosed. The transitional impairment testing was completed during the third quarter of 2002 and as of January 1, 2002 (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company also completed a 2002 annual impairment test as of November 30, 2002, and will be subject to impairment test each year thereafter and whenever there is an impairment indicator. Significant estimates and assumptions are used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and determining impairment to goodwill (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company cannot guarantee that there will not be impairments in subsequent years.  Other Intangible Assets  Other intangible assets consist primarily of deferred financing costs, trademarks, and establishing a registered national brand name. Prior to 2002, our trademarks and brand name were amortized on a straight line basis over 15 years. In accordance with SFAS 142, our trademarks and brand name are considered to have indefinite lives, and as such, are no longer subject to amortization. These assets will be tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator. Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective debt instruments. Customer lists and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.  Income Taxes  Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) represents the change during the period in the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Introduction  Revenues       Car Care Services  We own full service, exterior only and self-service car wash operations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Texas, Florida and Arizona, as well as truck washes in Arizona, Indiana, Ohio and Texas. We earn revenues from washing and detailing automobiles; performing oil and lubrication services, minor auto repairs, and state inspections; selling fuel; and selling merchandise through convenience stores within the car wash facilities. Revenues generated for 2002 for the car care segment were comprised of approximately 83% car wash and detailing, 10% lube and other automotive services, and 7% fuel and merchandise.  The majority of revenues are collected in the form of cash or credit card receipts, thus minimizing customer accounts receivable.  Weather can have and has had a significant impact on volume at the individual locations. We believe that the geographic diversity of our operating locations mitigates the risk of adverse weather-related influence on our volume.                                         19         Security Products  During 2000, 2001, and for the first four months of 2002, the Company was paid $20,000 per month under a Management Agreement pursuant to which Mark Sport, an entity controlled by Jon E. Goodrich, a director of the Company, operated the Security Products Segment. Effective May 1, 2002, the Management Agreement expired and the Company recommenced operation of the Security Products Segment. Prior to the acquisition of Micro-Tech, the Company operated its Security Products Segment solely as the Consumer Products Division. The Company's Consumer Products operations manufacture and market personal safety, and home and auto security products which are sold through retail stores, major discount stores, domestic and international distributors, and at the Company's car care facilities.  With the acquisition on August 12, 2002 of certain of the assets and operations of Micro-Tech, a manufacturer and retailer of electronic security and surveillance devices, the Company added an additional division to its Security Products Segment. The Company has added security cameras, closed-circuit monitors, digital video recording devices and related electronic security components to its line of well-known personal security products. The Company is purchasing these items for resale from OEM manufacturers.  Cost of Revenues       Car Care Services  Cost of revenues consists primarily of direct labor and related taxes and benefits, chemicals, wash and detailing supplies, rent, real estate taxes, utilities, car damages, maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities, as well as the cost of the fuel and merchandise sold.       Security Products  During 2000, 2001, and for the first four months of 2002, the Security Products Segment was operated under a Management Agreement by Mark Sport. Accordingly, during that time, no costs were incurred by the Company. Beginning in May of 2002, cost of revenues consists primarily of costs to manufacture the security products including direct labor and related taxes and benefits, and raw material costs. It is anticipated that the new electronic surveillance device business unit acquired during the current year will incur costs related to product returns and warranties and customer support, but those were insignificant during the current year.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management, clerical and administrative salaries, professional services, insurance premiums, sales commissions, and other costs relating to marketing and sales.  We capitalize direct incremental costs associated with purchase acquisitions. Indirect acquisition costs, such as executive salaries, corporate overhead, public relations, and other corporate services and overhead are expensed as incurred.  Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of buildings and equipment, and amortization of certain intangible assets. Buildings and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method. Intangible assets, other than goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, are amortized over their useful lives ranging from three to 15 years, using the straight-line method. In 2000 and 2001, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over 25 years. With the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, we no longer amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets, namely trademarks and service marks, determined to have indefinite useful lives, thereby eliminating approximately $900,000 in annual amortization expense.  Costs of Terminated Acquisitions  Our policy is to charge as an expense any previously capitalized expenditures relating to proposed acquisitions that in our current opinion will not be consummated. At December 31, 2002, there were no costs related directly to proposed acquisitions that were                                         20    not yet consummated. We periodically review the future likelihood of these acquisitions and record appropriate provisions against capitalized costs associated with projects that are not likely to be completed.  Asset Impairment Charges  In accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of for possible impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we wrote down assets determined to be imparied by approximately $1.2 million. The asset write-down related to one of our full service car wash sites in Texas and two full service car wash sites in Arizona. We have determined that due to poor demographics and increased competition in the geographic areas of these sites, their future expected cash flows will not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values. We are marketing these sites for sale and have written down these assets to their estimated fair market values based on expected proceeds upon sale.  In 2000, we wrote down the value of our Berlin, New Jersey facility by $138,000 to reflect the sales price of those assets in January 2001.  Other Income  Other income consists largely of rental income received on renting out excess space at our car wash facilities along with gains and losses on the sale of property and equipment.  Income Taxes  Income tax (benefit) expense reflects the recording of income taxes on (loss) income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle at effective rates of 36%, 37% and 32% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the income tax benefit related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was recorded at an effective tax rate of 36% for the impairments in the Arizona and truck wash reporting units. No income tax benefit was recorded for the Northeast Region reporting unit's impairment due to the non-deductibility of the goodwill. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year primarily due to state and local income taxes, non-deductible costs related to intangibles, fixed asset adjustments and changes to the valuation allowance.                                         21    Results of Operations for Each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2002  The following table presents the percentage each item in the consolidated statements of operations bears to total revenues:                                                                                          Year ended December 31,                                                                               ---------------------------------------                                                                                  2002           2001          2000                                                                               ----------     ----------    ----------        Revenues                                                                           100.0%         100.0%        100.0% Cost of revenues                                                                    71.1           70.7          73.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses                                        18.2           15.3          15.2 Depreciation and amortization                                                        4.2            5.8           5.1 Costs of terminated acquisitions                                                     0.1            0.3           1.2 Asset impairment charges                                                             2.5              -           0.3                                                                               ----------     ----------    ---------- Operating income                                                                     3.9            7.9           5.0 Interest expense, net                                                               (4.8)          (6.0)         (6.3) Other income                                                                         0.7            1.1           0.9                                                                               ----------     ----------    ---------- (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes                        (0.2)           3.0          (0.4) Income tax (benefit) expense                                                        (0.1)           1.1          (0.1)                                                                               ----------     ----------    ---------- (Loss) income from continuing operations                                            (0.1)           1.9          (0.3) Discontinued operations                                                                -              -           1.0                                                                               ----------     ----------    ---------- (Loss) income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle            (0.1)           1.9           0.7 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax benefit            (12.3)             -             -                                                                               ----------     ----------    ---------- Net (loss) income                                                                  (12.4)%          1.9%          0.7%                                                                               ==========     ==========    ==========   Revenues     Car Care Services  Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $44.1 million as compared to $48.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $3.9 million or 8.1%. Of the $44.1 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, $36.7 million or 83% was generated from car wash and detailing, $4.2 million or 10% from lube and other automotive services, and $3.2 million or 7% from fuel and merchandise sales. Of the $48.0 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, $39.9 million or 83% was generated from car wash and detailing, $4.5 million or 9% from lube and other automotive services, and $3.6 million or 8% from fuel and merchandise sales. The decrease in wash and detailing revenues was principally due to the divesting of two of our car wash locations during 2001 combined with a departure from our historic revenue levels within our Northeast region due to the unusual lack of snow and pollen in the first six months of 2002 and increased rainfall in the quarter ending December 31, 2002. The Company also experienced more challenging weather within its Texas region for the quarters ended September 30 and December 31, 2002. Overall car wash volume declined 8.4% in 2002 from 2001. In addition to these declines in volume, the Company experienced a slight reduction in average wash and detailing revenues per car to $13.89 in 2002, from $13.90 per car in 2001. Despite management's continued aggressive focus on selling detailing and additional on-line car wash services, more aggressive coupon and discount promotions to encourage volume reduced the average revenue per car. As to the decline in revenues from lube and other automotive services, we discontinued the practice of providing a free wash to lube customers, resulting in decreased lube revenues but benefitting our overall site gross margin performance. The decline in fuel and merchandise revenues is the result of instituting certain minimum gross margin criteria which reduced fuel sales and the sale of certain low margin merchandise.  Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $48.0 million as compared to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $0.2 million or 0.4%. Of the $48.0 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, $39.9 million or 83% was generated from car wash and detailing, $4.5 million or 9% from lube and other automotive services, and $3.6                                         22    million or 8% from fuel and merchandise sales. Of the $47.8 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, $37.8 million or 79% was generated from car wash and detailing, $4.9 million or 10% from lube and other automotive services, and $5.1 million or 11% from fuel and merchandise sales. The net increase in total revenue in 2001 is attributable to a full year of revenue earned at two car washes and five truck washes we acquired during 2000; internal growth through a continued aggressive focus on selling detailing and additional on-line car wash services which increased the average wash and detailing revenue per car by 8.1% or $1.04 to $13.90 in 2001, from $12.86 per car in 2000. This increase was offset partially by a reduction in wash volumes due to the divestiture of two car wash sites during 2001, a temporary decrease in car wash volume in all of our regions due to the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, and slightly more rain and cloud days in certain of our operating regions in 2001. In 2001, approximately 44% of our operating days within our markets were rainy or cloudy as compared to 43% in 2000. Additionally, we experienced an approximate $1.8 million or 18% decline in lube services, fuel and merchandise sales. We discontinued the practice of providing a free wash to lube customers resulting in decreased lube revenues but improved overall site gross margin performance. The decline in fuel and merchandise gross revenues is the result of instituting certain minimum sale margin criteria which reduced gross fuel sales and the sale of certain low margin merchandise.  During a portion of 2000, we managed several car wash locations under operating agreements, under which we were entitled to all profits generated from the operation of those locations. The income earned under the agreements is shown as revenue net of related operating expenses. Gross revenue generated by the locations under operating agreements for 2000 was $857,000. No locations were operated under operating agreements during 2002 or 2001.     Security Products  Pursuant to a Management Agreement, we earned $80,000, $240,000 and $220,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These amounts are included under revenues from operating agreements. Effective May 1, 2002, the Company recommenced operation of the Security Products Segment. Revenues for 2002 for the Consumer Products Division were approximately $2.1 million. Additionally, in August 2002, the Company purchased the inventory and certain assets and operations of Micro-Tech, an electronic surveillance and security device business. Revenues for this business unit were approximately $373,000 in 2002.  Cost of Revenues     Car Care Services  Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $31.8 million or 72% of revenues with car washing and detailing costs at 70% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 78% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 87% of respective revenues. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $34.1 million, or 71% of revenues with car wash and detailing costs at 69% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 77% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 89% of respective revenues.  With only a slight decrease in average wash and detailing revenues per car in 2002 and our continued emphasis on controlling direct labor and other operating costs such as wash and detailing chemicals and supplies, car damages, uniform expense, and repairs and maintenance costs, we experienced only a one percentage point reduction in wash and detailing gross margins in 2002 despite the 8% volume decline previously noted. We also experienced a slight increase in our direct wash and detailing labor costs as a percent of car wash and detail revenues to 48% in 2002 as compared to 47% in 2001 as a result of the volume decline.  Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $34.1 million or 71% of revenues with car washing and detailing costs at 69% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 77% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 89% of respective revenues. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $35.1 million, or 73% of revenues with car wash and detailing costs at 71% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 78% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 88% of respective revenues.  With our increase in average wash and detailing revenues per car of $1.04 or 8.1% in 2001 and our continued emphasis on controlling direct labor and other operating costs, we achieved improved wash and detailing gross margins in 2001. Additionally, the overall gross profit margin improved in 2001 as compared to 2000 as a result of less fuel, merchandise and lube sales, which carry higher costs as a percentage of revenues compared to wash and detail sales.                                         23       Security Products  During 2000, 2001 and for the first four months of 2002, pursuant to a Management Agreement, no costs were incurred by us. Cost of revenues were $1.4 million or 58% of revenues for the period during 2002 that we operated this segment.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $8.5 million compared to $7.4 million for the same period in 2001, an increase of approximately $1.1 million or 15%. SG&A costs as a percent of revenues were 18.2% for 2002 as compared to 15.3% in 2001. The increase in SG&A costs is primarily the result of recommencing operation of the Security Products Segment in May 2002, which along with the acquisition of Micro-Tech added a combined $1.0 million of SG&A costs in 2002. We also experienced an increase in certain credit card and bank charges and a significant increase in insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in administrative salaries and certain office costs.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $7.4 million compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.9%. Most of this increase is a result of SG&A costs incurred at the six additional locations acquired during 2000 and three sites transitioned from operating agreements to being owned. The remainder of the increase is primarily the result of increases in advertising, insurance costs and business taxes. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of administrative costs as a result of efficiencies gained through consolidating all of our regional back office activity into the Mt. Laurel, New Jersey corporate office.  Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization totaled $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $2.8 million for 2001. This decrease is primarily attributable to the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, under which the Company no longer amortizes goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives. This decrease of approximately $900,000 in amortization costs is partially offset by increased depreciation expense as a result of recent property and equipment purchases and recommencing operation of the Security Products Segment in May 2002.  Depreciation and amortization totaled $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2000, an increase of 14%. This increase is primarily the result of a full year of depreciation and amortization in 2001 on assets acquired through acquisitions during 2000.  Costs of Terminated Acquisitions  Our policy is to charge as an expense any previously capitalized expenditures relating to proposed acquisitions that in our current opinion will not be consummated. During 2002 and 2001, the costs of previously capitalized expenditures related to proposed acquisitions totaled approximately $57,000 and $135,000, respectively. These costs, which principally related to several possible acquisitions we pursued outside the car wash industry, are primarily related to due diligence costs. In 2000, costs of previously capitalized expenditures principally related to the termination of the Planet Truck Wash acquisition and acquisition related expenses associated with the proposed Wash Depot Holdings, Inc. ("Wash Depot") merger. We terminated the Wash Depot Merger Agreement on September 30, 2000, as a result of certain conditions precedent to closing not being satisfied by Wash Depot. Of the $580,000 in costs of terminated acquisitions in 2000, approximately $209,000 represented unrecoverable cash and stock deposits and approximately $371,000 represented external incremental transaction costs including legal, accounting, consulting and due diligence costs.  Asset Impairment Charges  In accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of for possible impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we wrote down assets determined to be imparied by approximately $1.2 million. The asset write-down related to one of our full service car wash sites in Texas and two full service car wash sites in Arizona. We have determined that due to poor demographics and increased competition in the geographic areas of these sites, their future expected cash flows will not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values. We are marketing these sites for sale and have written down these assets to their estimated fair market values based on expected proceeds upon sale.                                         24    In 2000, we wrote down the value of our Berlin, New Jersey facility by $138,000 to reflect the sales price of those assets in January 2001.  Interest Expense, Net  Interest expense, net of interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $2.2 million compared to $2.9 million for 2001. This decrease in our interest expense is the result of a decrease in interest rates on approximately 50% of our long term debt which has interest rates tied to the prime rate and a reduction in our outstanding debt as a result of normal principal payments.  Interest expense, net of interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $2.9 million compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This is the result of additional interest expense on borrowings relating to several acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2000, and additional working capital borrowings through a refinancing in the last quarter of 2000. This increase was offset by a decrease in interest rates on approximately 50% of our long term debt which has interest rates tied to the prime rate.  Other Income  Other income for 2002 was $327,000 compared to $514,000 for 2001. The primary reason for the decrease is that the 2001 figure includes a $216,000 gain on the sale of a car wash facility in August of 2001.  Other income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $514,000 compared to $408,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $106,000. This increase was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of approximately $216,000 on the sale of our facility in Morrisville, Pennsylvania in 2001, offset partially by a reduction in certain rental income in 2001.  Income Taxes  We recorded income tax (benefit) expense from continuing operations of $(32,000), $534,000, and $(66,000) for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Income tax (benefit) expense reflects the recording of income taxes on (loss) income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle at effective rates of 36%, 37% and 32% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We recorded an income tax benefit related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The income tax benefit reflects an effective rate of 36% for the impairment in the Arizona and truck wash reporting units. No income tax benefit was recorded for the Northeast Region reporting unit impairment due to the non-deductibility of the goodwill. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year primarily due to state and local income taxes, non-deductible costs related to intangibles, fixed asset adjustments and changes to the valuation allowance.  At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $15.5 million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. Components of the net operating loss carryforwards include $14.3 million from continuing operations and $1.2 million from acquired net operating losses attributable to the Colonial Full Service Car Wash, Inc. acquisition.  Liquidity and Capital Resources     Liquidity  Cash and cash equivalents were $6.2 million at December 31, 2002. The ratio of our total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt plus stockholders' equity, was 37% at December 31, 2002, 35% at December 31, 2001, and 37% at December 31, 2000.  Our business requires a substantial amount of capital, most notably to pursue our expansion strategies, including our current expansion in the electronic surveillance products business, and for equipment purchases and upgrades for our car care segment. We plan to meet these capital needs from various financing sources, including borrowings, internally generated funds, and the issuance of common stock if the market price of the Company's stock improves.  As of December 31, 2002, we had negative working capital of approximately $2.2 million. At December 31, 2001, working capital was $4.8 million and cash and cash equivalents were $6.6 million. The change in working capital at December 31, 2002 is primarily attributable to the reclassification of approximately $6.4 million of 15 year amortizing loans from long term to current                                         25    liabilities as a result of these loans being due in July 2003 and November 2003. The Company intends to renew these loans with the current lender. Although the Company has been successful in renewing similar loans with the current lender in the past, including the renewal of two loans in February 2003 totaling $4.7 million for a five year period, there can be no assurance that our lender will continue to provide us with renewals or with renewals at favorable terms.  We estimate aggregate capital expenditures for our car care segment, exclusive of acquisitions of businesses, of approximately $500,000 for the year ending December 31, 2003. In October 2002, we purchased a building as a warehouse, production and administrative facility for our new electronic surveillance products operations. We financed a portion of the $505,000 purchase price of this building with a long term mortgage of approximately $400,000. In addition to the purchase of the electronic surveillance products business and facility, we will also expend significant cash for the purchasing of inventory as we introduce new electronic surveillance products and for improvements to the new building. We estimate we will spend approximately $1 million for our initial inventory of electronic surveillance products through the first quarter ending March 31, 2003 and approximately $100,000 for capital improvements to the recently purchased building through the second quarter ending June 30, 2003.     Debt Capitalization and Other Financing Arrangements  At December 31, 2002, we had borrowings of approximately $33.3 million. We had three letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2002, totaling $525,000 as collateral relating to workers' compensation insurance policies. Additionally, we had four commercial letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2002 totaling $552,000 for the purchase of inventory for our new electronic surveillance products business. We maintain a revolving credit facility to provide financing for additional electronic surveillance product inventory purchases.  During 2000 and 2001, we refinanced on a long term basis under favorable terms the majority of our short term debt related to our 1999 and 2000 acquisitions. We also had various other long term mortgage notes up for periodic review during 2001 which we have been successful in renewing. Several of our debt agreements, as amended, contain certain affirmative and negative covenants and require the maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth and the maintenance of certain debt coverage ratios on an individual subsidiary and consolidated level. At December 31, 2002, we were not in compliance with our consolidated debt coverage ratios related to our Bank One, Texas, N.A. ("Bank One") term notes, our GMAC notes payable and our Wachovia Bank N.A. ("Wachovia") note payable. At December 31, 2002, we were also not in compliance with a debt coverage ratio requirement related to certain Bank One notes payable with our subsidiary, Colonial Full Service Car Wash, Inc. ("Colonial"). With respect to the GMAC notes payable and the Bank One notes payable related to Colonial, the Company has received waivers of acceleration of the notes as of December 31, 2002 and through January 1, 2004. Additionally, the Company has entered into amendments to the Bank One term loan agreements and a modification agreement to the Wachovia note payable. The Company is currently in compliance with the covenants as amended. The amended debt coverage ratio with Bank One requires the Company to maintain a consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") to debt service ("the debt coverage ratio") of 1.2 to 1 at December 31, 2002, and at December 31, 2003 and thereafter, and a 1.1 to 1 ratio for the twelve month periods ending March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003. As of March 17, 2003, the preliminary operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 through this date indicate that we should meet the required debt coverage ratio as of March 31, 2003; however, we cannot provide assurance that favorable operating trends will continue through March 31, 2003. If we default on the Bank One covenants, the Company will need to obtain a further amendment or waiver from Bank One. If the Company is unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, Bank One debt totaling $8,424,000 currently recorded as long-term debt at December 31, 2002 would become due on demand.  The Company's ongoing ability to comply with its debt covenants under its credit arrangements and refinance its debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow. Our cash flow has been and can continue to be adversely affected by weather patterns and the economic climate. In the event that non-compliance with the debt covenants should reoccur, the Company would pursue various alternatives to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments, or refinancing of debt with other financial institutions. Although the Company believes that it will be successful in resolving potential non-compliance with its debt covenants, or refinancing its current debt, there can be no assurance that further debt covenant waivers or amendments will be attained or that the debt will be refinanced with other financial institutions at favorable terms.  The Company is obligated under various operating leases, primarily for certain equipment and real estate within the car care segment. Certain of these leases contain purchase options, renewal provisions, and contingent rentals for proportionate share of taxes, utilities, insurance, and annual cost of living increases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases with initial                                         26    or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2002 are as follows: 2003 - $1.5 million; 2004 - $1.5 million; 2005 - $1.1 million; 2006 - $759,000; 2007 - $665,000; and thereafter - $2.4 million.

On April 5, 2000, we executed a master facility agreement with Fusion Capital Fund II, LLC ("Fusion") pursuant to which Fusion agreed to enter into up to two equity purchase agreements, each with an aggregate principal amount of $12.0 million. The master facility agreement expired on February 20, 2003. The first equity purchase agreement was executed by Fusion on April 17, 2000. Proceeds from purchased shares through December 31, 2001 totaled approximately $1.3 million. There were no purchased shares in 2002.     Cash Flows  Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was impacted by a mild winter and a spring with low pollen in our Northeast operating region, and unusually high precipitation throughout the majority of the year, especially in our Texas and East operating regions.  Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The use of cash in 2002 reflects $682,000 for capital expenditures relating to ongoing car care operations, $171,000 for ongoing security products operations and $217,000 expended for the acquisition of our new Electronic Surveillance Products business in August 2002.  Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This reflects routine principal payments on debt of $2.2 million and $422,000 for the purchase and retirement of shares of our common stock.  Seasonality and Inflation  The Company believes that its car washing and detailing operations are adversely affected by extended periods of inclement weather. In particular, long periods of rain and cloudy weather adversely affect our car wash volumes and related lube and other automotive services as people typically do not wash their cars during such periods. Additionally, extended periods of warm, dry weather may encourage customers to wash their cars themselves which also can adversely affect our car wash business. The Company has mitigated the risk of unfavorable weather patterns by having operations in diverse regions.  The Company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had, and are not expected to have any material adverse effect on its results of operations in the near future.                                         27    ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS  We are not materially exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices.  Interest Rate Exposure  A significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates, and as such, changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results unless and until such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity. All of our variable rate debt obligations are tied to the prime rate, as is our incremental borrowing rate. Therefore, a one percent increase in the prime rate would not have a material effect on the fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2002.  ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
