ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion reviews our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere herein.  The following discussion includes Forward Looking Statements. The accuracy of such statements depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations. Certain of these factors are discussed under Description of Business -- Factors Influencing Future Results and Accuracy of Forward-Looking Statements included in Item 1 of this report.  Introduction  Revenues    Car Care Services  We own full service, exterior only and self-service car wash locations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Texas, Florida and Arizona as well as truck washes in Arizona, Indiana, Ohio and Texas.  We earn revenues from washing and detailing automobiles; performing oil and lubrication services, minor auto repairs, and state inspections; selling fuel; and selling merchandise through convenience stores within the car wash facilities.  Revenues generated for the year ended December 31, 2001 for the car care segment were comprised of approximately 83% car wash and detailing, 9% lube and other automotive services, 8% fuel and merchandise.  The majority of our revenues are collected in the form of cash or credit card receipts, thus minimizing customer accounts receivable.  Weather can have a significant impact on volume at the individual locations. However, we believe that the geographic diversity of our operating locations minimizes overall weather-related influence on our volume.    Security Products  The Security Products Division manufactures and markets personal safety, and home and auto security products.  These products are sold through retail stores, major discount stores, and at our car care facilities.  Effective January 1, 2000, we entered into a Management Agreement, under which we earn $20,000 per month, which allows Mark Sport, an entity controlled by Jon E. Goodrich, a director of the Company, to operate the Security Products Division.    Computer Products and Services  Our computer products and services subsidiary, ICS, was sold in June of 2000 and has accordingly been reflected as discontinued operations.  Cost of Revenues    Car Care Services  Cost of revenues consists primarily of direct labor and related taxes and benefits, chemicals, wash and detailing supplies, rent, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities, as well as the cost of the fuel and merchandise sold.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management, clerical and administrative salaries, professional services, insurance premiums, and costs relating to marketing and sales.  We capitalize direct incremental costs associated with purchase acquisitions. Indirect acquisition costs, such as executive salaries, corporate overhead, public relations, and other corporate services and overhead are expensed as incurred.                                         16   Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of buildings and equipment, and  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets. Buildings and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method.  Goodwill was amortized on a straight- line basis over 25 years through December 31, 2001.  Other intangibles are amortized over their useful lives ranging from three to twenty years, using the straight line method.  With the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, we will no longer amortize goodwill.  Costs of Terminated Acquisitions  Our policy is to charge as an expense any previously capitalized expenditures relating to proposed acquisitions that in our current opinion will not be consummated.  At December 31, 2001, there were no capitalized costs related directly to proposed acquisitions that were not yet consummated.  We periodically review the future likelihood of these acquisitions and record appropriate provisions against capitalized costs associated with projects that are not likely to be completed.  Merger Costs  In connection with acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method, we recorded various merger costs. Merger costs consisted of transaction- related expenses including deal costs, legal, accounting and other professional and consulting fees, filing fees, external due diligence costs, contractual costs, and finder fees as well as employee severance and termination costs.  Restructuring, Asset Write-Downs and Change in Control Charges  In conjunction with our 1999 change in control, we recorded costs relating to restructuring of certain of our security products operations, abandoning certain operations and assets, and incurring certain other change in control related costs.  Additionally, in 2000, we wrote down the value of our Berlin, New Jersey facility by $137,904 to reflect the sales price of those assets in January 2001.  Other Income and Expense  Other income and expense includes gains and losses on the sale of equipment and rental income received on renting out excess space at our car wash facilities.  Income Taxes  Income tax expense (benefit) reflects the recording of income taxes at an effective rate of 37%, 32% and 32% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 , respectively.  The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year primarily due to state and local income taxes, non-deductible costs related to intangibles, the use of net operating loss carryforwards, fixed asset adjustments and changes to the valuation allowance.                                         17   Results of Operations for Each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2001    The following table presents the percentage each item in the consolidated statements of operations bears to total revenues:                                                                    Year ended December 31,                                                               --------------------------                                                                 2001     2000     1999                                                               -------- -------- --------                Revenues                                                  100.0%   100.0%   100.0%        Cost of revenues                                           70.7     73.2     64.6        Selling, general and administrative expenses               15.3     15.2     22.3        Depreciation and amortization                               5.8      5.1      4.3        Costs of terminated acquisitions                            0.3      1.2        -        Merger costs                                                  -        -      7.3       Restructuring, asset write-downs and change        in control charges                                           -      0.3      5.9                                                               -------  -------  -------       Operating income (loss)                                     7.9      5.0     (4.4)        Interest expense, net                                      (6.0)    (6.3)    (4.0)        Other income                                                1.1      0.9      0.8                                                               -------  -------  -------       Income (loss) from continuing operations before income      3.0     (0.4)    (7.6)        Income tax expense (benefit)                                1.1     (0.1)    (2.4)                                                               -------  -------  -------       Income (loss) from continuing operations                    1.9     (0.3)    (5.2)        Discontinued operations                                       -      1.0      0.3                                                               -------  -------  -------       Net income (loss)                                           1.9%     0.7%    (4.9)%                                                               =======  =======  =======   Revenues   Car Care Services  Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $48.0 million as compared to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $0.2 million or 0.4%.  Of the $48.0 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, $39.9 million or 83% was generated from car wash and detailing, $4.5 million or 9% from lube and other automotive services, and $3.6 million or 8% from fuel and merchandise sales.  Of the $47.8 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, $37.8 million or 79% was generated from car wash and detailing, $4.9 million or 10% from lube and other automotive services, and  $5.1 million or 11% from fuel and merchandise sales.  The net increase in total revenue in 2001 is attributable to a full year of revenue earned at two car washes and five truck washes we acquired during 2000; internal growth through a continued aggressive focus on selling detailing and additional on-line car wash services which increased the average wash and detailing revenue per car by 8.1% or $1.04 to $13.90 in 2001, from $12.86 per car in 2000.  This increase was offset partially by a reduction in wash volumes due to the divestiture of two car wash sites during 2001, a temporary decrease in car wash volume in all of our regions due to the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, and slightly more rain and cloud days in certain of our operating regions in 2001. In 2001, approximately 43.6% of our operating days within our markets were rainy or cloudy as compared to 42.9% in 2000.  Additionally, we experienced an approximate $1.8 million or 18% decline in lube services, fuel and merchandise sales.  We discontinued the practice of providing a free wash to lube customers resulting in decreased lube revenues but improved overall site gross margin performance.  The decline in fuel and merchandise gross revenues is the result of instituting certain minimum sale margin criteria which reduced gross fuel sales and the sale of certain low margin merchandise.  During a portion of 2000 and 1999, we managed several car wash locations under operating agreements, under which we were entitled to all profits generated from the operation of those locations.  The income earned under the agreements is shown as revenue net of related operating expenses.  Gross revenue generated by the locations under operating agreements for 2000 and 1999 was $857,000 and $10.1 million, respectively.  No locations were operated under operating agreements during 2001.                                         18   Revenues for 2000 of $47.8 million were $25.5 million or 114% greater than revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 of $22.3 million.  Of the $22.3 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999, $17.1 million or 77% was generated from car wash and detailing, $2.7 million or 12% from lube and other automotive services,  $2.1 million or 9% from fuel and merchandise sales and $462,000 or 2% from operating agreements.  Revenues for 1999, including gross revenue generated by locations under operating agreements were $32.0 million consisting of $25.6 million, or 80%, from car wash and detailing, $3.3 million, or 10%, from lube and other automotive services, and $3.1 million, or 10%, from fuel and merchandise sales. This increase in total revenues was primarily attributable to the 15 purchase acquisitions completed from May 1999 to December 31, 2000.  Revenue increases were also realized through internal growth from selling detailing and additional on-line car wash services.    Security Products  Pursuant to a Management Agreement, we earned $240,000 and $220,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively.  These amounts are included under revenues from operating agreements.  Revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999, prior to the Management Agreement, were $3.4 million.  Cost of Revenues    Car Care Services  Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $34.1 million or 71% of revenues with car washing and detailing costs at 69% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 77% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 89% of respective revenues.  Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $35.1 million, or 73% of revenues with car wash and detailing costs at 71% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 78% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 88% of respective revenues.  With our increase in average wash and detailing revenues per car of $1.04 or 8.1% in 2001 and our continued emphasis on controlling direct labor and other operating costs, we achieved improved wash and detailing gross margins in 2001. Additionally, the overall gross profit margin improved in 2001 as compared to 2000 as a result of less fuel, merchandise and lube sales, which carry higher costs as a percentage of revenues compared to wash and detail sales.  Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $14.8 million, or 64% of revenues.  However, because income earned under operating agreements is shown as a net figure in revenue, already reduced by cost of revenues, the cost of revenue percentage for this segment is better analyzed on a gross method.  With revenues and cost of revenues for locations under operating agreement shown on a gross basis, total cost of revenues for 1999 was $22.2 million or 69% of revenues for this segment, with car wash and detailing costs at 66% of respective revenues, lube and other automotive services costs at 78% of respective revenues, and fuel and merchandise costs at 84% of respective revenues.  The increase in cost of revenues as a percent of revenues in 2000 compared to 1999 is largely a result of certain direct labor inefficiencies present with significant inclement weather combined with an increase in detailing services which require more labor than wash services.  In 2000, approximately 42.9% of our operating days within our markets were rainy or cloudy as compared to 33.9% in 1999.  Additionally, significant time invested by us in 2000 on the terminated Wash Depot acquisition, combined with certain turnover in our regional management resulted in this increase in our labor expense and in labor as a percent of revenues.    Security Products  During 2001 and 2000, pursuant to a Management Agreement, no costs were incurred by us.  Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999, prior to the Management Agreement, were $1.8 million.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $7,366,000 compared to $7,303,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $63,000, or 0.9%.  Most of this increase is a result of SG&A costs incurred at the six additional locations acquired during 2000 and three sites transitioned from operating agreements to being owned.  The                                         19   remainder of the increase is primarily the result of increases in advertising, insurance costs and business taxes. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of administrative costs as a result of efficiencies gained through consolidating all of our regional back office activity into the Mt. Laurel, New Jersey corporate office.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $5.8 million as compared to the $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $1.5 million, or 26%.  The primary reason for this increase is the infrastructure established during the 21 months ended December 31, 2000 in order to effectively enter the car care industry and execute our growth strategy.  These increased costs included accounting, finance, legal and administrative costs necessary to integrate the acquisitions consummated.  This increase is partially offset by cost controls placed on previously private companies and favorable pricing for supplies, insurance, other indirect costs due to economies of scale, and the elimination of costs at our security products facility.  Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization totaled $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2000, an increase of 14%.  This increase is primarily the result of a full year of depreciation and amortization in 2001 on assets acquired through acquisitions during 2000.  With the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, we will no longer amortize goodwill.  Goodwill amortization expense was approximately $889,000 in 2001.  Depreciation and amortization increased $1.4 million or 125% to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 1999.  This increase is the result of entering the car care industry, which required a substantial investment in property and equipment.  Additionally, certain acquisitions resulted in the recording of goodwill, which increased amortization expense.  This increase was partially offset by the elimination of expenses at our security products facility.  Costs of Terminated Acquisitions  Our policy is to charge as an expense any previously capitalized expenditures relating to proposed acquisitions that in our current opinion will not be consummated.  During the year ended December 31, 2001, the costs of previously capitalized expenditures related to proposed acquisitions totaled approximately $135,000.  These costs, which principally related to several possible acquisitions we pursued outside the car wash industry, are primarily related to due diligence costs.  In 2000, costs of previously capitalized expenditures principally related to the termination of the Planet Truck Wash acquisition and acquisition related expenses associated with the proposed Wash Depot Holdings, Inc. ("Wash Depot") merger.  We terminated the Wash Depot Merger Agreement on September 30, 2000, as a result of certain conditions precedent to closing not being satisfied by Wash Depot.  Of the $580,000 in costs of terminated acquisitions in 2000, approximately $209,000 represented unrecoverable cash and stock deposits and approximately $371,000 represented external incremental transaction costs including legal, accounting, consulting and due diligence costs.  Merger Costs  In 1999, we incurred approximately $225,000, $120,000, and $1,530,000 in merger- related costs associated with the ICS, Classic, and Eager Beaver mergers, respectively.  Merger costs consisted of transaction-related expenses of $680,000 which includes deal costs, legal, accounting and other professional and consulting fees, filing fees, external due diligence costs, contractual costs, and finder fees as well as employee severance and termination costs which totaled $1,195,000.  Additionally, tax provisions of  $96,000, and $50,000 were recorded at the date of the mergers relating to net deferred tax liabilities with respect to the termination of the previous S Corporation elections of Classic and Eager Beaver, respectively.  This total of $146,000 was included within the income tax benefit for 1999.  Restructuring, Asset Write-Downs and Change in Control Charges  In conjunction with the Company's 1999 change in control, we restructured certain of our security products operations, abandoned certain operations and assets, and incurred certain other change in control related costs.  A restructuring, asset write-down and change in control charge totaling $1,519,000 was recorded in the second quarter ending June 30, 1999.  Of this charge, $1,178,000 was non-cash in nature consisting of a $218,000 write-off of certain assets as a result of abandoning certain product lines within our security products segment; a $373,000 write-off of leasehold improvements related to our plan to abandon a portion of our currently leased facilities in Vermont; and a $587,000 non-cash compensation charge relating to the vesting of variable options  to certain previous directors of the Company upon the Company's change in control.  The remaining charge of approximately                                         20   $341,000 included certain severance costs accrued as well as legal, accounting and other transaction costs related to the Company's change in control. Additionally, in 2000, we wrote down the value of our Berlin, New Jersey facility by $137,904 to reflect the sales price of those assets in January 2001.  Interest Expense, Net  Interest expense, net of interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $2.9 million compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This is the result of additional interest expense on borrowings relating to several acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2000, and additional working capital borrowings through a refinancing in the last quarter of 2000. This increase was offset by a decrease in interest rates on approximately 50% of our long term debt which has interest rates tied to the prime rate.  Interest expense, net of interest income, for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $1.0 million, compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase is principally the result of borrowings for acquisitions during 1999 and 2000.  Other Income and Expense  Other income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $514,000 compared to $408,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $106,000.  This increase was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of approximately $216,000 on the sale of our facility in Morrisville, Pennsylvania in 2001, offset partially by a reduction in certain rental income in 2001.  Other income for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $205,000 as compared to other income of $408,000 in 2000. This increase in other income was due primarily to additional rental income received from renting out excess space at wash facilities acquired during 1999 and 2000.  Income Taxes  We recorded income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations of $534,000, $(66,000) and $(618,519) for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Income tax expense (benefit) reflects the recording of income taxes at an effective rate of 37%, 32% and 32% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 , respectively.  The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year primarily due to state and local income taxes, non- deductible costs related to intangibles, the use of net operating loss carryforwards, fixed asset adjustments and changes to the valuation allowance.  At December 31, 2001, we had approximately $12.7 million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes.  Components of the net operating loss carryforwards include $11.5 million from continuing operations and $1.2 million from acquired net operating losses attributable to the Colonial Full Service Car Wash, Inc. acquisition.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our business requires substantial amounts of capital, most notably to pursue our acquisition strategy and for equipment purchases and upgrades. We plan to meet these capital needs from various financing sources, including borrowings, internally generated funds, and the issuance of common stock as the market price of our stock improves.  We estimate aggregate capital expenditures, exclusive of acquisitions of businesses, of approximately $750,000 for the year ending December 31, 2002.  As of December 31, 2001, we had working capital of approximately $4.8 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $6.6 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2001, net cash provided by operations was approximately $3.6 million, net cash used in financing activities was approximately $2.3 million and net cash provided by investing activities was approximately $430,000 resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year of approximately $1.8 million.  Capital expended during the period included $876,000 for the purchase of operating equipment and real estate.  At December 31, 2001, we had borrowings of approximately $34.3 million.  We had two letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2001, totaling $625,000 as collateral relating to worker compensation insurance policies.  We do not have a revolving credit facility.  During 2001, we refinanced on a long term basis under favorable terms the majority of our short term debt related to our 1999 and 2000 acquisitions.  In February 2000, we entered into a $4.8 million term loan with Bank One, Texas, NA ("Bank One") to refinance the remaining balance of a short term promissory note related to the Genie acquisition and entered into several new loan agreements with Bank One to finalize the assumption of notes held by Bank One relating to the Colonial acquisition.                                         21   Additionally, in November 2000, we entered into a $6.7 million three year term note (15 year amortization basis) with Bank One to refinance a $1.3 million convertible promissory note to Bullseye Properties assumed in connection with the acquisition of Eager Beaver, a $2.1 million SouthTrust Bank note scheduled to mature in May 2001, and a $1.0 million promissory note related to the Red Baron Truck Wash acquisition. The Bank One term note also provided approximately $800,000 for the purchase of the leased Beneva Car Wash property and approximately $1.6 million of additional funding, net of loan closing costs, for capital improvements and working capital.  We also had various other long term mortgage notes up for periodic review during 2001 which we have been successful in renewing.  Several of our debt agreements, as amended, contain certain affirmative and negative covenants and require the maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth and the maintenance of certain debt coverage ratios on an individual subsidiary and consolidated level.  On April 5, 2000, we executed a master facility agreement with Fusion Capital Fund II, LLC ("Fusion") pursuant to which Fusion agreed to enter into up to two equity purchase agreements, each with an aggregate principal amount of $12.0 million. The equity purchase agreements allow us to suspend the purchasing of our common stock by Fusion if the price of our common stock is less than $7.00 per share.  We are currently not permitting the purchase of our common stock under the equity purchase agreement due to the current low trading value of our common stock and the potentially dilutive effect of such stock purchases.  If and when we agree to the purchase of our stock, Fusion has the right to purchase from us shares of common stock up to $12.0 million at a price equal to the lesser of (1) 140% of the average of the closing bid prices for our common stock during the 10 trading days prior to the date of the applicable equity purchase agreement or $7.00, whichever is greater or (2) a price based upon the future performance of the common stock, in each case without any fixed discount to the market price.  As long as we have not suspended Fusion from purchasing our stock, the equity purchase agreement requires that at the beginning of each month, Fusion will pay us $1.0 million as partial prepayment for the common stock.  Once the $1.0 million has been applied to purchase shares of our common stock, Fusion will pay the remaining principal amount upon receipt of our common stock.  The first equity purchase agreement was executed by Fusion on April 17, 2000.  Proceeds from purchased shares through December 31, 2001 totaled approximately $1.3 million.  The first equity purchase agreement was extended to February 20, 2003.  The second equity purchase agreement will be executed after delivery of an irrevocable written notice by us to Fusion stating that we elect to enter into such purchase agreement with Fusion. The second equity purchase agreement may be entered into only after the principal amount under the first equity purchase agreement is fully converted into our common stock.  Seasonality and Inflation  We believe that our car washing and detailing operations are adversely affected by periods of inclement weather.  We have mitigated and intend to continue to mitigate the impact of inclement weather through geographic diversification of our operations.  We believe that inflation and changing prices have not had, and are not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations in the near future.  ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS  We are not materially exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices.  Interest Rate Exposure  A significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates, and as such, changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results unless and until such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity.  All of our variable rate debt obligations are tied to the prime rate, as is our incremental borrowing rate.  Therefore, a one percent increase in the prime rate would not have a material effect on the fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2001.  ITEM 8.
