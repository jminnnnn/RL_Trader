ITEM 7.           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL   CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following discussion reviews our operations for each of the two years in the periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere herein.    FACTORS INFLUENCING FUTURE RESULTS AND ACCURACY OF FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act (“Forward-Looking Statements”).  All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are Forward-Looking Statements.  Forward-Looking Statements are statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, Forward-Looking Statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," believe," "seek," or ''will." Forward-Looking Statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. For us, particular uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our Forward-Looking Statements include: the severity and duration of current economic and financial conditions; our success in selling our remaining car washes; the level of demand of the customers we serve for our goods and services; and numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business and competitive nature. These uncertainties are described in more detail in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Forward- Looking Statements made herein are only made as of the date of this filing, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such Forward-Looking Statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.             18                Introduction     Revenues    Security    Our Security Segment designs, manufactures, assembles, markets and sells a wide range of security products.  The products include less-than-lethal Mace® defense sprays, intrusion fencing, access control, security cameras and security digital recorders. The Security Segment also owns and operates a UL listed monitoring center that monitors video and security alarms for approximately 400 security dealer clients with over 41,000 end-user accounts. The Security Segment’s electronic surveillance products and components are purchased from Asian and European manufacturers.  Many of our products are designed to our specifications. We sell the electronic surveillance products and components primarily to installing dealers, distributors, system integrators and end-users.  Other products in our Security Segment are less-than-lethal Mace® defense sprays and other security devices such as monitors, high-end digital and machine vision cameras and professional imaging components.  The main marketing channels for our products are industry shows, trade publications, catalogs, the internet, telephone orders, distributors, and mass merchants.  Revenues generated for the year ended December 31, 2010 for the Security Segment were comprised of approximately 22% from our professional electronic surveillance operation, 7% from our consumer direct home and small business electronic surveillance operations, 25% from our machine vision camera and video conferencing equipment operation, 29% from our personal defense and law enforcement aerosol operation in Vermont, and 17% from our wholesale security monitoring operation in California.    Cost of Revenues    Security    Cost of revenues within the Security Segment consists primarily of costs to purchase or manufacture the security products including direct labor and related taxes and fringe benefits, and raw material costs, and telecommunication costs related to our wholesale monitoring operation. Product warranty costs related to the Security Segment are mitigated in that a portion of customer product warranty claims are covered by the supplier through repair or replacement of the product associated with the warranty claim.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consist primarily of management, clerical and administrative salaries, professional services, insurance premiums, sales commissions, and other costs relating to marketing and sales.    We expense direct incremental costs associated with business acquisitions as well as indirect acquisition costs, such as executive salaries, corporate overhead, public relations, and other corporate services and overhead.    Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of buildings and equipment, and amortization of leasehold improvements and certain intangible assets.  Buildings and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the lease term with renewal options. Intangible assets, other than goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, are amortized over their useful lives ranging from three to fifteen years, using the straight-line or an accelerated method.    Other Income    Other income consists primarily of gains and losses on short-term investments.    Income Taxes    Income tax expense is derived from tax provisions for interim periods that are based on the Company’s estimated annual effective rate.  Currently, the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes, non-deductible costs related to acquired intangibles, and changes to the valuation allowance.             19                Discontinued Operations    Digital Media Marketing    The Company’s Board of Directors committed to a plan to divest of the Digital Media Marketing Segment and, on November 11, 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to sell the e-commerce division of its Digital Media Marketing Segment, Linkstar Corporation. On November 22, 2010, we sold Linkstar Corporation for a sale price of $1.1 million to Silverback Network, Inc. (the “Purchaser”). Under terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser paid $1.1 million for the stock of Linkstar Corporation, $990,000 of which was received at closing with ten percent (10%) of the purchase price, or $110,000, placed into escrow, which funds will be released to the Company in six months provided there are no unsatisfied indemnity claims under the Stock Purchase Agreement. The results of the Digital Media Marketing Segment’s operations have been classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale in our balance sheet at December 31, 2010, and as discontinued operations in our statements of operations and our statements of cash flows.  Our Digital Media Marketing Segment consisted of two business divisions: (1) e-commerce and (2) online marketing. At December 31, 2010, the results of operations of our previously owned Digital Media Marketing operations are reported as discontinued operations; and accordingly, have been segregated from the revenue and expense discussions below.    Linkstar, the e-commerce division, was a direct-response product business that developed, marketed and sold products directly to consumers through the internet. We reached our customers predominantly through online advertising on third-party promotional websites. Linkstar also marketed products on promotional websites operated by Promopath, our online marketing division. Promopath, our online affiliate marketing company, secured customer acquisitions or leads for advertising clients principally by using promotional internet sites that offer free gifts.    Revenues within our Digital Media Marketing Segment for the year ended December 31, 2010 were approximately $5.9 million, consisting of $5.7 million, or 97%, from our e-commerce division and $172,000, or 3%, from our online marketing division.    Cost of revenues within the Digital Media Marketing Segment consisted primarily of amounts we pay to website publishers that are directly related to revenue-generating events, including the cost to enroll new members, fulfillment and warehousing costs, including direct labor and related taxes, fringe benefits and e-commerce product costs. Promopath’s largest expense is the purchasing of internet addresses to which it sends its promotional pages.    Car Wash Services    At December 31, 2010, we owned or leased four full service car wash locations in Texas which are reported as discontinued operations (see Note 5. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and accordingly, have been segregated from the following revenue and expense discussion.  We earn revenues from washing and detailing automobiles; performing oil and lubrication services, minor auto repairs, and state inspections; selling fuel; and selling merchandise through convenience stores within the car wash facilities.  The majority of revenues from our car wash operations are collected in the form of cash or credit card receipts, thus minimizing customer accounts receivable. Cost of revenues within the car wash operations consists primarily of direct labor and related taxes and fringe benefits, certain insurance costs, chemicals, wash and detailing supplies, rent, real estate taxes, utilities, car damages, maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities, as well as the cost of the fuel and merchandise sold.    On December 31, 2007, Eagle completed the purchase of the Company’s five truck washes for $1.2 million in consideration, consisting of $280,000 cash and a $920,000 note payable to the Company secured by mortgages on the truck washes. The $920,000 note, which has a balance of $832,000 at December 31, 2010, has a five-year term, with principal and interest paid on a 15-year amortization schedule.             20                Results of Operations for the Two Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009    The following table presents the percentage each item in the consolidated statements of operations bears to total revenues:               Year ended December 31,               2010          2009                               Revenues         100  %        100  %    Cost of revenues         70.0           69.9       Selling, general and administrative expenses         52.0           68.3       Arbitration award         25.1           -       Depreciation and amortization         3.2           3.0       Asset impairment charges         2.6           2.5       Operating loss         (52.9  )        (43.7  )    Interest expense, net         (0.2  )        (0.0  )    Other income         -           -       Loss from continuing operations before income taxes         (53.1  )        (43.7  )    Income tax expense         (0.2  )        -       Loss from continuing operations         (53.3  )        (43.7  )    Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax         (45.1  )        (15.2  )    Net loss         (98.4  )%        (58.9  )%      Revenues    Security    Revenues were approximately $18.4 million and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Of the $18.4 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, $3.9 million, or 22%, was generated from our professional electronic surveillance operations, $1.3 million, or 7%, from our consumer direct home and small business electronic surveillance operations, $4.6 million or 25%, from our high-end digital and machine vision cameras and professional imaging components operation, $5.4 million, or 29%, from our personal defense and law enforcement aerosol operations in Vermont, and $3.2 million, or 17%, from our wholesale security monitoring operation in California acquired on April 30, 2009. Of the $18.6 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, $4.7 million, or 25%, was generated from our professional electronic surveillance operation, $2.5 million, or 14%, from our consumer direct home and small business electronic surveillance operation, $4.1 million or 22% from our high-end digital and machine vision cameras and professional  imaging components operation, $5.0 million, or 27%, from our personal defense and law enforcement aerosol operation in Vermont and $2.3 million, or 12%, from our wholesale security monitoring operation.    Overall revenues within the Security Segment remained constant in 2010, despite increases in revenues from our wholesale security monitoring operation acquired in April 2009, our existing Vermont personal defense operation and from our machine vision operation.  Revenues decreased in our consumer direct electronic surveillance division and our professional electronic surveillance operation.  The combined $1.9 million, or 26%, decrease in sales within our consumer direct and professional electronic surveillance operations was due to several factors, including the impact on sales of increased competition and a reduction in spending by many of our customers impacted by low housing construction starts.  Our Vermont personal defense operations sales increased approximately $328,000, or 7%, from 2009 to 2010, with an increase noted in the sale of aerosol and non-aerosol products and TG Guard systems. Additionally, the Company’s machine vision camera and video conferencing equipment operations experienced an approximate $473,000, or 12%, increase in sales in 2010 over 2009, largely as a result of a focus on vertically integrating products, selling more system solutions, combined with increased sales in international markets.             21                Cost of Revenues    Security    Costs of revenues were $12.9 million and $13.0 million or 70% of revenues for 2010 and 2009, respectively.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    SG&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $9.6 million and $12.7 million, respectively.  SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 52% in 2010 as compared to 68% for 2009. The reduction in SG&A costs were the result of implementation of corporate wide cost savings measures in 2008 through 2010, including a significant reduction in employees throughout the entire Company.  The cost savings were partially realized from a reduction in costs with the consolidation of our security division’s surveillance equipment warehouse operations into our Farmers Branch, Texas facility, as well as the consolidation of customer service, accounting services, and other administrative functions within these operations.  SG&A costs decreased within our Florida and Texas electronic surveillance equipment operations by approximately $1.3 million, or 30%, partially as a result of our consolidation efforts to reduce SG&A expenses as noted above and partially as a result of our reduced sales levels.  In addition to these cost savings measures, we noted a reduction in stock option non-cash compensation expense from continuing operations from approximately $115,000 in 2009 to $66,000 in 2010.  SG&A expenses also include legal costs related to the recently settled arbitration proceedings with Mr. Paolino of approximately $344,000 and $798,000 for 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $224,000 and $163,000 of severance cost related to employee reductions in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Finally, in May 2010, the Company adjusted a contingent purchase price payout related to its April 2009 acquisition of the Company’s wholesale monitoring operation originally recorded at $276,000 after determining that acquired recurring monthly revenue (“RMR”) calculated at the acquisition’s one year anniversary date was less than the required amount as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement.  Accordingly, the Company recorded a reduction in SG&A expenses during the second quarter ended June 30, 2010 of $276,000 and reduced a portion of the previously recorded contingent liability at the date of the acquisition of CSSS.    Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation and amortization totaled $582,000 and $567,000 for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 was principally related to amortization expense on the CSSS acquired intangible assets.    Asset Impairment Charges    In accordance with ASC 360,  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  we periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used, and assets to be disposed of, for possible impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value, net of costs to sell.    Continuing Operations    In assessing goodwill for impairment, we first compare the fair value of our final reporting unit containing goodwill, our wholesale monitoring business, with its net book value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using discounted expected future cash flows, supported by the results of various market approach valuation models. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is not impaired, and no further testing is necessary. If the net book value of this reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. To measure the amount of any impairment loss, we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if our reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet, we record an impairment charge for the difference.    We performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market approaches, in our goodwill assessment process. The following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the fair value of the reporting units.              ·    Income Approach:  To determine fair value, we discounted the expected cash flows of the reporting unit. The discount rate used represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in our reporting units and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we used estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value.                22                          ·    Market-Based Approach:  To corroborate the results of the income approach described above, we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit using several market-based approaches, including the value that we derive based on our consolidated stock price as described above. We also used the guideline company method which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar/guideline publicly traded companies.       The determination of the fair value of the reporting unit requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit’s expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units or the goodwill impairment charge.    The allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, customer relationships, non-competition agreements and current replacement costs for certain property, plant and equipment.    Due to continuing challenges in our Mace Security Products, Inc. reporting unit, we performed certain impairment testing of our remaining intangible assets, specifically, the value assigned to customer lists, product lists, and trademarks as of June 30, 2009, December 31, 2009,  June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010. We recorded an impairment charge to trademarks of approximately $80,000 and an impairment charge of $142,000 to customer lists, both principally related to our consumer direct electronic surveillance operations as of June 30, 2009 and an impairment charge of $30,000 for trademarks related to our high end digital and machine vision cameras and professional imaging component operations at December 31, 2009.  With continuing deterioration in 2010, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $74,000 to customer lists, $81,000 to product lists, and $70,000 for trademarks as of June 30, 2010, and impairment charges of $260,000 at December 31, 2010 relating to trademarks, all principally related to our consumer direct electronic surveillance operations and our high end digital and machine vision cameras and professional imaging component operation.    Additionally, we conduct our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment for our wholesale security monitoring business reporting unit as of April 30 of each year. This is our remaining business reporting unit with recorded goodwill. With respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our wholesale security monitoring business as of April 30, 2010, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit exceeded the book value of its invested capital. Our wholesale security monitoring business has recorded goodwill of $1.98 million, which exceeds the book value of its invested capital by $249,000, or 7.8%. Subsequent to our most recent annual testing date of April 30, 2010, the operating results of this reporting unit have performed at expected levels and no impairment indicators were deemed present at December 31, 2010. The determination of the fair value of this reporting unit requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit’s expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, expected future revenues and expense levels, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures forecasts. We periodically update our forecasted cash flows of the wholesale security monitoring reporting unit considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our views of growth rates, anticipated future economic and relevant regulatory conditions.  The key or most significant assumption is our estimate of future recurring revenues. If monthly recurring revenue from security monitoring services within this reporting unit were to be adversely affected by the ongoing economic climate or by other events and we were unable to adjust operating costs to compensate for such revenue loss, this reporting unit would be adversely affected which would negatively impact the fair value of this business. Based on the Company’s April 30, 2010 assessment, a hypothetical reduction in the annual recurring revenue growth rate from a range of 5% to 6% to an annual recurring revenue growth ratio of 3% to 4%, without a corresponding decrease in operating expenses, would result in an approximate $500,000 impairment charge.  Additional events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on estimated fair value of this reporting unit include, but are not limited to, a loss of customers due to competition, pressure from our customers to reduce pricing, the purchase of our dealers by third parties who choose to obtain monitoring services elsewhere, the current adverse financial and economic conditions on revenues and costs, inability to continue to employ a competent workforce at current rates of pay, changes in government regulations, and accelerating costs beyond management’s control.    In the fourth quarter of 2008, we consolidated the inventory in our Fort Lauderdale, Florida warehouse into our Farmers Branch, Texas facility.  Certain of our administrative and sale staff of our Security Segment’s electronic surveillance products division remain in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida building, which we listed for sale with a real estate broker.  We performed an updated market evaluation of this property, listing the facility for sale at a price of $1,950,000.  We recorded an impairment charge of $275,000 related to this property at December 31, 2008, and additional impairment charges totaling $210,000 in 2009 to write-down the property to our estimate of net realizable value based on updated market valuations of the property.  On December 4, 2009, the Company sold the Fort Lauderdale, Florida building, subject to an Agreement of Sale entered into on October 5, 2009, and recorded a loss of $107,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009 after closing costs and broker commissions.             23                Discontinued Operations    As noted in  Note 4 .  Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,  in the accompanying financial statements, the agreements of sale related to the three car washes the Company owned in Austin, Texas were amended to modify the sale price to $8.0 million. This amended sale price, less costs to sell, was estimated to result in a loss upon disposal of approximately $175,000. Accordingly, an impairment loss of $175,000 was recorded as of September 30, 2009 and included in the results from discounted operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The sale of the Austin, Texas car washes was completed on November 30, 2009. During the quarter ended December 31, 2009, we wrote down three Arlington, Texas car wash sites for a total of $1.2 million, including a $200,000 write down of a car wash site for which the Company entered into an agreement of sale on January 27, 2010 for a sale price below its net book value; and a $37,000 write down related to a Lubbock, Texas car wash sold on March 10, 2010. In April 2010, we reduced the sale price of a Lubbock, Texas car wash location based on recent offers of $1.7 million for this location and our decision to negotiate a sale of this site at this price, which was below the net book value of $1.85 million.  Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $150,000 related to this site at March 31, 2010. Finally, in October 2010, we accepted an offer to purchase our Arlington, Texas oil lubrication and self serve car wash facility for a sale price of $340,000, which was below the site’s net book value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $53,000 related to this site as of September 30, 2010.  We have determined that, due to further reductions in car wash volumes at these sites resulting from increased competition and a deterioration in demographic in the immediate geographic areas of these sites, current economic pressures, along with current data utilized to estimate the fair value of these car wash facilities, future expected cash flows would not be sufficient to recover their carrying values.    Prior to the disposition of our Digital Media Marketing Segment in the fourth quarter of 2010, we conducted our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment for this reporting unit as of June 30 of each year.  We updated our forecasted cash flows of these reporting units during the second quarter of each year.  These updates considered current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results for the launch of new products as well as non-product revenue growth, and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.  Based on the results of our assessment of goodwill impairment at June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010, the net book value of our Digital Media Marketing Segment reporting unit exceeded its fair value at both measurement dates.  With the noted potential impairment at June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010, we performed the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  The resulting implied goodwill was $5.9 million at June 30, 2009 and $2.8 million at June 30, 2010, which were less than the recorded value of goodwill at these respective dates. Accordingly, we recorded impairments to write down goodwill of this reporting unit by $1.0 million and $3.1 million at June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010, respectively. Additionally, during our June 30, 2010 review of intangible assets, we determined that trademarks within our Digital Media Marketing Segment were also impaired by $275,000. Finally, as noted in  Note 5. Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale,  we entered into an agreement of sale on November 11, 2010 to sell the e-commerce division of our Digital Media Marketing Segment, Linkstar, for a sale price of $1.1 million. Accordingly, an impairment loss of $3.6 million was recorded as of September 30, 2010 and included in the results from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The $3.6 million impairment charge included a write-off of the remaining goodwill of the Digital Media Marketing Segment of $2.8 million and $800,000 related to other intangible assets, including software, trademarks, and non-compete agreements. With the closing of the sale of the e-commerce division of our Digital Media Marketing Segment on November 22, 2010, a final loss of $191,000 on disposal was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010.    Interest Expense, Net    Interest expense, net of interest income, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $51,000 and $7,000, respectively. The increase in net interest expense is due to an increase in interest expense of approximately $14,000 and a reduction in interest income of approximately $30,000 with the Company’s decrease in average cash and cash equivalent balances on hand during 2010.    Other Income    Other income was $5,000 and $0 for 2010 and 2009, respectively.             24                Income Taxes    We recorded income tax expense of $30,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Income tax expense (benefit) reflects the recording of income taxes on loss before income taxes at effective rates of approximately (0.3)%, and (0)% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year primarily due to state and local income taxes, non-deductible costs related to intangibles, and changes to the valuation allowance.    Realization of the future tax benefits related to the deferred tax assets is dependent upon many factors, including the Company’s ability to generate taxable income in future years. The Company performed a detailed review of the considerations influencing our ability to realize the future benefit of the NOLs, including the extent of recently used NOLs, the turnaround of future deductible temporary differences, the duration of the NOL carryforward period, and the Company’s future projection of taxable income. The Company increased its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by $3.8 million in 2010 and $3.4 million in 2009 with a total valuation allowance of $22.2 million at December 31, 2010 representing the amount of its deferred income tax assets in excess of the Company’s deferred income tax liabilities. The valuation allowance was recorded because management was unable to conclude that realization of the net deferred income tax asset was more likely than not. This determination was a result of the Company’s continued losses, the uncertainty of the timing of the Company’s sale of its remaining Car Wash operations, and the ultimate extent of growth in the Company’s Security Segment.    Discontinued Operations    Digital Media Marketing    Revenues within our Digital Media Marketing Segment for the year ended December 31, 2010 were approximately $5.9 million, consisting of $5.7 million from our e-commerce division and $172,000 from our online marketing division.  Revenues within our Digital Media Marketing Segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 were approximately $9.7 million, consisting of $9.6 million from our e-commerce division and $21,000 from our online marketing division.  The reduction in revenues within our e-commerce division of approximately $4.0 million is principally related to a reduction in sales in our Purity by Mineral Science cosmetic product line, our ExtremeBriteWhite teeth whitening product, and our cross sell revenue with third-party companies. Additionally, in May 2010, many credit card companies implemented restrictive controls over customer data in response to legislation which negatively impacted our cross sell revenue.  Finally, our ExtremeBriteWhite product sales were negatively impacted during the second and third quarter of 2010 as a result of one of our credit card processors discontinuing the processing of payments for this product.    Cost of revenues within our Digital Media Marketing Segment was approximately $4.7 million, or 79% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2010 and approximately $6.9 million, or 72% of revenues, for the year ended December 2009.  The decrease in cost is due to a decline in new member acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in average CPA marketing expense for ExtremeBriteWhite customers.  CPA marketing expense is recognized at the time a new member is acquired.    Car Wash Services    Revenues within the car wash operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $5.1 million as compared to $10.6 million for the same period in 2009, a decrease of $5.5 million or 52%. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in wash and detail services, principally due to the sale of car washes and reduced car wash volumes in the Texas market. Overall car wash volumes declined by 252,000 cars, or 60%, in 2010 as compared to 2009, largely related to the closure and divestiture of 11 car wash locations in Texas since January 2009.  Additionally, the Company experienced a slight decrease in average car wash and detailing revenue per car from $17.89 in 2009 to $17.38 in 2010.    Cost of revenues within the car wash operations were $4.6 million, or 91% of revenues, and $6.6 million or 88% of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The increase in cost of revenues as a percent of revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009 was the result of the reduction in car wash volumes and a slight increase in cost of labor as a percentage of car wash and detailing revenues.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    Liquidity    Cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 million at December 31, 2010.  The ratio of our total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt plus stockholders’ equity, was 20.0% at December 31, 2010 and 8.4% at December 31, 2009.   Our business requires a substantial amount of capital, most notably to fund our losses.  We plan to meet these capital needs from various financing sources, including borrowings, cash generated from the sale of car washes, and the issuance of common stock. Our debt covenants with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. require us to maintain a total unencumbered cash and marketable securities balance of $1.5 million.             25              As of December 31, 2010, we had working capital of approximately $7.0 million.  Working capital was approximately $16.6 million at December 31, 2009.  Our positive working capital decreased by approximately $9.6 million from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, principally due to the payment of $4.6 million for the Paolino arbitration award and from our 2010 net loss. As described in  Note 18.  Commitments and Contingencies,  the Company and Mr. Paolino settled the various legal actions they had filed against each other in exchange for the Company paying Mr. Paolino $2,300,000 on November 1, 2010 and $2,310,000 on December 29, 2010.    The Company funded a portion of the payment to Mr. Paolino by borrowing $1.35 million from Merlin Partners, LP (“Merlin”).  The loan which had an original maturity date of March 28, 2011 was extended to April 28, 2011.   The loan was payable in two installments of $675,000 each upon the closing of each of two car washes that were under agreements of sale at December 31, 2010.  The Company made a payment of $675,000 to Merlin upon the sale of the Lubbock, Texas car wash on March 8, 2011. The Company expects to pay the remaining balance owed plus accrued interest from the proceeds generated by the sale of a Dallas, Texas area car wash that is under an agreement of sale and expected to close in the second quarter of 2011. Merlin is a fund managed by Ancora Advisors, a subsidiary of the Ancora Group.  Richard Barone, a Company director, is Chairman of the Ancora Group.  The loan bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum, and is secured by second liens on the Dallas, Texas area car wash and a security interest in the trade name “Mace”.  As part of the consideration for the financing, Merlin was also granted a Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase up to 314,715 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.20 per share, expiring December 28, 2015.  The Warrant contains anti-dilution provisions providing that Merlin will receive additional warrants exercisable into 2% of any common stock of the Company issued by the Company through December 28, 2011.  The exercise price of the Warrant will be adjusted lower to equal the stock issuance price of any stock issued through December 28, 2011 at a price below $0.20.  The warrants were accounted for under the equity method with the Black-Scholes fair value of the warrants of $63,274 recorded as a discount to the $1.35 million Merlin loan and as additional paid-in capital. The discount will be charged to interest expense over the three month maturity period of the loan with an offsetting credit to the loan balance.     The Company plans to raise working capital through a rights offering or other sale of securities. On December 23, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to prepare a rights offering to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Rights Offering”). On March 25, 2011, the Company and Ancora Securities, Inc. ("Ancora") executed a Placement Agent and Dealer-Manager Agreement, under which Ancora will act as the placement agent for the planned Rights Offering. The basic terms of the Rights Offering being prepared is for each stockholder to be given the right to purchase three shares of common stock for each share of common stock owned as of the record date, at an exercise price to be established by the Company.  The record date and exercise price will be determined and set by the Board of Directors at a later date near the date of the mailing of the prospectus for the Rights Offering.  All new shares issued under the Rights Offering will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).  We have also entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated March 25, 2011 ("Securities Purchase Agreement") with Merlin, a hedge fund which is under common control with Ancora.  In accordance with the Securities Purchase Agreement, Merlin and up to three assignees of Merlin, will purchase $4,000,000 of our common stock, valued at the per share exercise price used in the Rights Offering at the conclusion of the Rights Offering.  There are conditions to Merlin's obligation to purchase, including: (i) that the Rights Offering occur; (ii) the stock sold to Merlin is registered under the Securities Act; and (iii) the Company expand its Board of Directors to seven persons with the two vacancies created by the expansion to be filled with individuals acceptable to Merlin. The Company is currently preparing a registration statement to register the Rights Offering stock and the stock to be sold to Merlin.  Richard Barone, a member of our Board of Directors, is a controlling owner of Ancora Securities, Inc and Ancora Advisors, LLC.  Ancora Advisors, LLC is the manager of Merlin.    The Rights Offering is expected to be made to stockholders in the first half of 2011.  This disclosure of the Rights Offering does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of any securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.    We have been funding our losses through the sale of assets.  In 2010, we generated $3.1 million in cash from the sale of assets, including $990,000 from the sale of Linkstar and $2.1 million from the sale of four car washes, net of related mortgages.  As of December 31, 2010, we had four remaining car washes for sale, two of which were under agreements of sale (See  Note 4. Business Acquisitions  and  Divestitures  and  Note 21. Subsequent Events).  A car wash was sold on March 8, 2011 with the sale of one of the three remaining car washes pending.    As of March 21, 2011, we had three remaining car washes for sale which we estimate will generate proceeds, net of related mortgages, in the range of approximately $1.7 million to $2.0 million. We also  listed our Texas warehouse for sale in August, 2010 with a real estate broker, which we estimate will generate proceeds, net of related mortgage debt, of approximately $1.0 million to $1.2 million.             26                To the extent we do not reduce the current negative cash flow from operations of approximately $250,000 per month or generate sufficient cash from the sale of assets, we may not have sufficient cash to operate.  To the extent we lack cash to meet our future capital and cash operating requirements, we will need to raise additional funds through bank borrowings and additional equity and/or debt financings, which may result in significant increases in leverage and interest expense and/or substantial dilution of our outstanding equity.  We estimate that our cash balances will not be sufficient to pay our estimated cash operating requirements through December 31, 2011 unless we are successful in increasing our cash position through the above noted asset sales or raising additional capital through the sale of securities. There can be no assurance that adequate pending asset sales will take place prior to December 31, 2011 or that we will be successful in selling our securities. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we will need to substantially reduce the scale of operations and curtail our business plans. Additionally, we will not have sufficient funds to meet capital expenditures and cash operating requirements through the next twelve months and will not comply with our debt covenants with JP Morgan Chase, unless we can increase sales and reduce the current levels of negative cash flow from operations as per the Company’s business plan, complete the pending sale of assets and/or raise additional cash from securities sales. Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors above for Risks Related to Our Business and Common Stock.    If we generate cash from the successful sale of our remaining Car Wash operations and our Texas warehouse as planned, our current cash and short-term investment balance at December 31, 2010 of $2.6 million and the cash proceeds from these asset sales will be sufficient to meet our future capital expenditure and operating funding needs through at least the next twelve months and will allow us to continue to satisfy our debt covenant requirement with Chase.    One of our short-term investments in 2008 was in a hedge fund, the Victory Fund, Ltd.  The Victory Fund, Ltd. was a "Ponzi" scheme operated by Arthur Nadel.  Mr. Nadel has been criminally convicted and a receiver was appointed to recover assets of the hedge fund on behalf of its investors.  We invested $2.0 million in the Victory Fund and were repaid $1.0 million through a redemption on November 5, 2008.  We recorded a charge of $2.2 million as an investment loss at December 31, 2008, which included $1.2 million that was reported by the hedge funds as profit on the initial investment.  If we recover any of the $1.0 million initial investment loss, such amounts will be recorded as recoveries in future periods when received.    Capital expenditures for our Security Segment and our corporate division were $348,000 and $430,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures in our discontinued operations, consisting of car wash operations and our Digital Media Marketing business, were $13,000 and $64,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  We estimate capital expenditures for the Security Segment at approximately $150,000 to $200,000 for 2011, principally related to technology and facility improvements for warehouse production equipment.    We intend to continue to expend cash for the purchasing of inventory as we grow and introduce new video surveillance and access control products in 2011 and in years subsequent to 2011.  We anticipate that inventory purchases will be funded from cash collected from sales and working capital.  At December 31, 2010, we maintained a $500,000 revolving credit facility with Chase to provide financing for additional video surveillance and access control product inventory purchases and for issuance of commercial letters of credit.    The amount of capital that we will spend in 2011 and in years subsequent to 2011 on all of our businesses is largely dependent on the profitability of our businesses. During the six months ended December 31, 2008, throughout 2009, and into 2010, we implemented Company-wide cost savings measures, including a reduction in employees throughout the entire Company, and completed a consolidation and reorganization of our Security Segment’s electronic surveillance equipment operations in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Farmers Branch, Texas at December 31, 2008.  Our goals of the reorganization were to better align our electronic surveillance equipment sales teams to achieve sales growth, gain efficiencies by sharing redundant functions within our security operations, such as warehousing, customer service, and administrative services, and to streamline our organizational structure and management team for improved long-term growth.  During the twelve months ending December 31, 2010, we incurred approximately $224,000 in severance costs from employee reductions.    During January 2008, the EPA conducted a site investigation at the Company’s Bennington, Vermont location and the building within which the facility is located.  The Company leases 33,476 square feet of the building from Vermont Mill.  The site investigation was focused on whether hazardous substances were being improperly stored.  After the site investigation, the EPA notified the Company and the building owner, Benmont, that remediation of certain hazardous wastes was required.  Vermont Mill and Benmont are both owned and controlled by Jon Goodrich, the president of the Company’s defense spray division.  The EPA, the Company, and the building owner entered into an Administrative Consent Order under which the hazardous materials and waste were remediated. All remediation required by the Administrative Consent Order was completed within the time allowed by the EPA and a final report regarding the remediation was submitted to the EPA in October 2008, as required by the Administrative Consent Order.  On September 29, 2009, the EPA accepted the final report. On February 23, 2010, the EPA issued the Company an invoice for $240,096 representing the total of the EPA's oversight costs that the Company and Benmont were obligated to pay under the Administrative Consent Order.  On April 8, 2010, the Company negotiated a reduction in the oversight cost reimbursement and, on April 13, 2010, the Company paid a negotiated amount of $216,086 to the EPA.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, Benmont reimbursed the Company 15% of the amount paid to the EPA or $32,413.  A total estimated cost of approximately $786,000 relating to the remediation, which includes disposal of the waste materials, as well as expenses incurred to engage environmental engineers and legal counsel and reimbursement of the EPA’s costs, has been recorded through December 31, 2010.             27                The U.S. Attorney conducted an investigation of the Company relating to possible violations of the RCRA at the Company’s Bennington, Vermont location. On November 16, 2010, the U.S. Attorney filed a one count indictment charging the Company and Jon Goodrich with a felony of storing hazardous waste without a permit under 42 U.S.C. Section 6928(d)(2)(A).   Mr. Goodrich is the President of Mace Personal Defense, Inc., the Company's defense spray division located in Bennington, Vermont.  The Company has resolved the indictment through a Plea Agreement entered into between the Company's subsidiary, Mace Personal Defense, Inc. and the U.S. Attorney.  The Plea Agreement was made under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), and provides in part, for (i) Mace Personal Defense, Inc., to plead guilty to one count of violating 42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(2)(A) (Storage of Hazardous Waste Without a Permit); (ii) Mace Personal Defense, Inc. to pay a fine of $100,000 (the "Fine") and a court assessment of $400, the Fine to be paid $34,000 on sentencing, and two additional installments of $33,000 each, at six months and twelve months from January 4, 2011; (iii) the Company to guarantee the payment of the Fine; (iv) the United States to dismiss the indictment against the Company at time of sentencing of Mace Personal Defense, Inc.; and (v) the United States not to prosecute Mace Personal Defense, Inc. (excluding the guilty plea) or the Company for any criminal offenses known to the United States Attorney's Office of Vermont as of the date of signing of the Plea Agreement committed by the Company or Mace Personal Defense, Inc. in the District of Vermont relative to the storage, shipment, handling or disposal of hazardous waste, including any associated record keeping or reporting offenses.  The Plea Agreement is not final until it is accepted by the Court. A hearing date for sentencing has been scheduled for May 26, 2011. In addition to the Company incurring $83,000 in legal expenses in 2010 relating to this matter, the Company has recorded an accrual of $100,000 at December 31, 2010 as a result of its agreement to pay a $100,000 Fine as part of the Plea Agreement.    The Company is a party to various other legal proceedings related to its ordinary business activities.  In the opinion of the Company’s management, none of these proceedings are material in relation to the Company’s results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, or financial condition.    In the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing by selling our common stock and obtaining mortgage loans.  Our ability to obtain new financing can be adversely impacted by our stock price.  Our failure to maintain the required debt covenants on existing loans also adversely impacts our ability to obtain additional financing.  We are reluctant to sell our common stock at market prices below our per share book value.  Our ability to obtain new financing will be limited if our stock price is not above our per share book value and our cash from operating activities does not improve. Currently, we cannot incur additional long term debt without the approval of one of our commercial lenders. The Company must demonstrate that the cash flow benefit from the use of new loan proceeds exceeds the resulting future debt service requirements.    Debt Capitalization and Other Financing Arrangements    At December 31, 2010, we had borrowings, including capital lease obligations, of approximately $3.5 million. We had two letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2010, totaling $307,566, as collateral relating to workers’ compensation insurance policies. We maintain a $500,000 revolving credit facility to provide financing for additional video surveillance product inventory purchases and for issuance of commercial letters of credit.  There were five commercial letters of credit outstanding for inventory purchases under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2010 totaling $399,000.    Several of our debt agreements, as amended, contain certain affirmative and negative covenants and require the maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth, maintenance of certain unencumbered cash and marketable securities balances, limitations on capital spending and the maintenance of certain debt service coverage ratios on a consolidated level.    The Chase term loan agreements limit capital expenditures annually to $1.0 million, require the Company to provide Chase with an Annual Report on Form 10-K and audited financial statements within 120 days of the Company’s fiscal year end and a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, and require the maintenance of a minimum total unencumbered cash and marketable securities balance of $1.5 million.    The Company’s ongoing ability to comply with its debt covenants under its credit arrangements and to refinance its debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow.  If our future cash flows are less than expected or our debt service, including interest expense, increases more than expected, causing us to default on any of the Chase covenants in the future, the Company will need to obtain further amendments or waivers from Chase. Our cash flow has been and could continue to be adversely affected by continued deterioration in economic conditions, and the requirements to fund the growth of our security business.  In the event that non-compliance with the debt covenants should occur, the Company would pursue various alternatives in an attempt to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments or refinancing debt with other financial institutions.  If the Company was unable to obtain waivers or amendments in the future, Chase debt currently totaling $1.5 million, would become payable on demand by the financial institution.  There can be no assurance that debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained or that the debt would be refinanced with other financial institutions at favorable terms.             28                The Company is obligated under various operating leases, primarily for certain equipment and real estate within the Car Wash operations.  Certain of these leases contain purchase options, renewal provisions, and contingent rentals for our proportionate share of taxes, utilities, insurance, and annual cost of living increases.    The following are summaries of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at December 31, 2010, including capital lease obligations, debt related to discontinued operations, and liabilities related to assets held for sale (in thousands):                  Payments Due By Period        Contractual Obligations   (1)       Total          Less Than  One Year          One to Three  Years          Three to Five  Years          More Than  Five Years        Long-term debt (2)      $  3,341        $  2,165        $  1,016        $  160        $  -       Capital lease obligations         128           58           70           -           -       Minimum operating lease payments         2,359           846           993           462           58             $  5,828        $  3,069        $  2,079        $  622        $  58                    Amounts Expiring Per Period        Other Commercial Commitments       Total          Less Than One  Year          One to Three  Years          Three to Five  Years          More Than Five  Years        Line of credit  (3)      $  399        $  399        $  -        $  -        $  -       Standby letters of credit  (4)         308           308           -           -           -             $  707        $  707        $  -        $  -        $  -                   (1)    Potential amounts for inventory ordered under purchase orders are not reflected in the amounts above as they are typically cancelable prior to delivery and, if purchased, would be sold within the normal business cycle.               (2)    Related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule.  Our interest payments for the next twelve month period, based on current market rates, are expected to be approximately $93,000.               (3)    The Company maintains a $500,000 line of credit with Chase. There were five commercial letters of credit outstanding for inventory purchases under this line of credit at December 31, 2010 totaling $399,000.             (4)     Outstanding letters of credit of $308,000 represent collateral for workers’ compensation insurance policies.        Cash Flows    Operating Activities.   Net cash used in operating activities totaled $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Cash used in operating activities in 2010 was primarily due to a net loss from continuing operations of $9.8 million, partially offset by $66,000 of non-cash stock-based compensation charges from continuing operations, $583,000 of depreciation and amortization expense and $485,000 of other intangible asset impairment charges. Cash was also impacted by an increase in accounts receivable of $444,000, a decrease in accounts payable and accrual expenses of $886,000, and a decrease in inventory of $974,000.    Net cash used in operating activities totaled $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Cash used in operating activities in 2009 was primarily due to a net loss from continuing operations of $8.1 million, which included $115,000 in non-cash stock-based compensation charges, $567,000 of depreciation and amortization expense and $462,000 of goodwill and asset impairment charges.  Cash was also impacted by an increase in accounts receivable of $487,000, a decrease in inventory of $1.5 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.0 million.            29                  Investing Activities .  Cash provided by investing activities totaled approximately $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, which includes cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of $3.0 million related to the sale of four car wash sites and Linkstar Corporation from our former Digital Media Marketing Segment in the year ended December 31, 2010.  Investing activity also included capital expenditures of $348,000 related to ongoing operations and proceeds from short-term investments of $1.1 million.    Cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which includes cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations of $6.1.  Investing activity in 2009 also included capital expenditures of $430,000 related to ongoing operations and $1.9 million related to the acquisition of CSSS.    Financing Activities .  Cash provided in financing activities was approximately $681,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, which includes $1.4 million of borrowings, largely related to a $1.35 million short term note with Merlin, $136,000 of routine principal payments on debt from continuing operations, and $178,000 related to the purchase of treasury stock.  Financing activities also include $448,000 of routine principal payments on debt related to discontinued operations.    Cash used in financing activities was approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which included $93,000 of routine principal payments related to continuing operations and $1.0 million of routine principal payments on debt related to discontinued operations.    Seasonality and Inflation    The Company does not believe that its operations are subject to seasonality.    Summary of Critical Accounting Policies    Revenue Recognition   and Deferred Revenue    The Company recognizes revenue in general when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, a customer contract or purchase order exists and the fees are fixed and determinable, no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.  Allowances for sales returns, discounts and allowances are estimated and recorded concurrent with the recognition of the sale and are primarily based on historic return rates.    Revenues from the Company’s Security Segment are recognized when shipments are made or security monitoring services are provided, or for export sales, when title has passed. More specifically, revenue is recognized and recorded by our electronic surveillance equipment business and personal defense spray and related products business when shipments are made and title has passed. Revenue within of our wholesale security monitoring operation is recognized and recorded on a monthly basis as security monitoring services are provided to its dealers under cancellable contracts with terms generally for two (2) to twenty-four (24) months. Revenues are recorded net of sales returns and discounts.    The Company’s discontinued Digital Media Marketing Segment’s e-commerce division recognized revenue and the related product costs for trial product shipments after the expiration of the trial period.  Marketing costs incurred by the e-commerce division were recognized as incurred. The online marketing division recognized revenue and cost of sales based on the gross amount received from advertisers and the amount paid to the publishers placing the advertisements as cost of sales.    Revenues from the Company’s discontinued Car Wash operations are recognized, net of customer coupon discounts, when services are rendered or fuel or merchandise is sold.  The Company records a liability for gift certificates, ticket books, and seasonal and annual passes sold at its car care locations but not yet redeemed.  The Company estimates these unredeemed amounts based on gift certificate and ticket book sales and redemptions throughout the year, as well as utilizing historic sales and tracking of redemption rates per the car washes’ point-of-sale systems. Seasonal and annual passes are amortized on a straight-line basis over the time during which the passes are valid.     Fair Value Measurements     The Company’s nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets including property, plant and equipment. The Company did record impairment charges for certain of these assets during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.  See  Note 19. Asset Impairment Charges.             30                 Accounts Receivable      The Company’s accounts receivable are due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on evaluation of customers’ financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Payment terms vary and amounts due from customers are stated in the financial statements net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.  Accounts which are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due.  The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the customer’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole.  The Company writes off accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible. Any payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Risk of losses from international sales within the Security Segment are reduced by requiring substantially all international customers to provide either irrevocable confirmed letters of credit or cash advances.      Inventories      Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method for security and e-commerce products.  Inventories at the Company’s car wash locations consist of various chemicals and cleaning supplies used in operations and merchandise and fuel for resale to consumers.  Inventories within the Company’s Security Segment consist of defense sprays, child safety products, electronic security monitors, cameras and digital recorders, and various other consumer security and safety products. The Company continually, and at least on a quarterly basis, reviews the book value of slow moving inventory items, as well as discontinued product lines, to determine if inventory is properly valued. The Company identifies slow moving or discontinued product lines by a detail review of recent sales volumes of inventory items as well as a review of recent selling prices versus cost and assesses the ability to dispose of inventory items at a price greater than cost. If it is determined that cost is less than market value, then cost is used for inventory valuation.  If market value is less than cost, then an adjustment is made to the Company’s obsolescence reserve to adjust the inventory to market value. When slow moving items are sold at a price less than cost, the difference between cost and selling price is charged against the established obsolescence reserve.      Property and Equipment      Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally as follows: buildings and leasehold improvements - 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment - 5 to 20 years; and furniture and fixtures - 5 to 10 years.  Significant additions or improvements extending assets' useful lives are capitalized; normal maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.     Advertising and Marketing Costs     The Company expenses advertising costs in its Security Segment and in its Car Wash operations, including advertising production cost, as the costs are incurred or the first time the advertisement appears.  Marketing costs in the Company’s Digital Media Marketing Segment, which consist of the costs to acquire new members for its e-commerce business, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized over the expected life of a customer.     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets    We periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used, and assets to be disposed of, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. If significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows.  Cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets, rather than a single asset.  If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded.    Goodwill    Goodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we have acquired in business combinations.  We perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis for each of our reporting units as previously disclosed. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the businesses, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  The Company conducts its annual goodwill impairment test as of April 30 of each year for its wholesale security monitoring operation business unit or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.  We periodically analyze whether any such indicators of impairment exist.  A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred.  Such indicators may include a sustained, significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition and/or slower expected growth rates, among others.  The Company compares the fair value of each of its reporting units to their respective carrying values, including related goodwill.  Future changes in the industry could impact the results of future annual impairment tests. There can be no assurance that future tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges.             31                Other Intangible Assets    Other intangible assets consist primarily of deferred financing costs, non-compete agreements, customer lists, software costs, product lists, patent costs, and trademarks.  Our trademarks are considered to have indefinite lives, and as such, are not subject to amortization. These assets are tested for impairment using discounted cash flow methodology annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator.  Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized.  Several impairment indicators are beyond our control, and determining whether or not they will occur cannot be predicted with any certainty.  Customer lists, product lists, software costs, patents and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line or accelerated basis over their respective assigned estimated useful lives.    Income Taxes    Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.  Deferred income tax expense (benefit) represents the change during the period in the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities.  In establishing the provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted laws, published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings. Deferred income tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.    ITEM 7A.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS    We are not materially exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices.    Nearly all of the Company’s debt at December 31, 2010, including debt related to discontinued operations, is at variable rates. Substantially all of our variable rate debt obligations are tied to the prime rate, as is our incremental borrowing rate. A one percent increase in the prime rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010. The impact of increasing interest rates by one percent would be an increase in interest expense of approximately $24,000 in 2010.    ITEM 8.         FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
