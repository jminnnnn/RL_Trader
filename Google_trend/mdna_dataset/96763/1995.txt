ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Liquidity and Capital Resources      Cash and cash equivalents totalled $8.7 million at December 31, 1994, compared to $7.7 million a year earlier.  Working capital was $30.2 million, compared to $24.1 million at December 31, 1993.  Contributing to the year-to-year increase in working capital was the 1994 acquisition of the Fil-Mag Group as discussed below.      Cash provided by operating activities was $9.6 million.  The positive cash flow was composed mainly of net earnings of $6.9 million; depreciation and amortization of $5.3 million; and increases in accounts payable ($1.1 million) and accrued expenses ($3.9 million).  A cash decrease due to deferred tax benefits was offset by an increase in income taxes payable. Cash was consumed by increases in accounts receivable ($4.6 million) and inventories ($2.5 million). Those increases were caused by the increase in sales from 1993 to 1994.      Investing activities consumed $13 million during 1994.  Capital expenditures constituted $4.4 million, excluding acquisitions. Separately, $8.8 million was paid for the capital stock of the Fil-Mag Group, net of cash acquired.  Financing for the acquisition was provided by drawing down approximately $10 million on a temporary acquisition line of credit from CoreStates Bank, N.A., which was subsequently replaced by a three year revolving credit loan.  Projected 1995 capital expenditures are expected to be financed by internally generated funds.      Cash provided by financing activities was a net $4.2 million.  The aforementioned $10 million loan was the source of funds. Cash consumed by financing activities was due to combined debt reduction of $3.5 million, and $2.3 million of dividend payments. It is expected that dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis during 1995.      The Company's foreign sales are conducted primarily through its foreign subsidiaries, principally in the Far East and Europe. In the Far East, the Company's sales are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. In Europe, sales are denominated primarily in local currencies (consisting mainly of English pounds and French francs) and to a lesser extent in U.S. dollars.      Since a very significant portion of the Company's foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, the Company does not believe that its potential exposure to currency fluctuations is material to its business. During 1993 and 1994, the Company did not purchase any currency exchange forward contracts or similar instruments generally utilized to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations. The Company will reexamine this policy if sales denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars become material to operations.

The 45.7% increase was due to the $30.8 million sales of the Fil-Mag Group, acquired in January 1994, and a combined sales increase of $15.1 million realized by the other businesses of the Company.  All three of the Company's segments experienced increased sales in 1994 from 1993.      The December 31 backlog was $28.7 million in 1994 and $14.9 million in 1993.  Contributing to the increase was the Fil-Mag Group's backlog.      The increase in sales of the Electronic Products Segment to $41.2 million included the sales of the Fil-Mag Group as noted above.  Operating profit of the Electronics Products Segment increased to $5.0 million in 1994, compared to $1.7 million in the prior year.  The increase reflected the fifty weeks of profits of the Fil-Mag Group since its acquisition in January 1994.  As a percentage of sales, this segment's annual operating profits equaled 12.2% which was the highest of the Company's three product segments. Year end backlog and order volumes indicated a softening in the segment's domestic markets, while offshore demand remained relatively strong.      The Metallurgical Products Segment produced increased sales, operating profit and operating profit as a function of sales in 1994 as compared to 1993. AMI experienced its largest sales and profit improvements to the product line which was acquired from Engelhard Corporation in 1991. Housing starts continue to have an eventual impact on demand for various AMI products.  Management is monitoring the indirect effect that recent interest rate increases will have on AMI backlog levels which were stable entering the first quarter of 1995.  Separately, Chace sales and operating profits also grew year-to-year.  On-going efforts aimed at cost containment and quality improvements have contributed to the growth in sales volume and profits. Chace's proven ability to compete in a demanding industrial market was reflected by a strong backlog position as it began the new year.      Two of the three operating units which constitute the End User/Finished Products Segment experienced an increase in sales and operating profits.  Chatillon sales volume and profitability improved in its primary product families, as the improved economic climate contributed to more favorable market conditions.  Lloyd's year-to-year sales increase reflected incremental unit sales and the absence of the unfavorable currency translation which negatively impacted 1993 results.  Lower sales and operating profit occurred at the Company's Products Division.  Domestic demand for currency counters and dispensers decreased during 1994, which was also the first full year subsequent to the Division withdrawing as a provider of engineering services on a prime contract basis to an agency of the U.S. Government.      The Company's selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $27.3 million in 1994 from $19.4 million in 1993. The key reason for the increase was the addition of the Fil-Mag Group.      Interest expense grew to $1.1 million, caused by the $10 million increase in outstanding debt to fund the Fil-Mag Group acquisition and rising interest rates during the year.      1994 income tax expenses increased as a function of pre-tax earnings. The 1994 effective income tax rate rose to 39% from 35% in 1993 as a result of proportionately higher taxable income being earned by the Company's domestic operations. Effective income tax rates of the domestic operations generally exceed those of the Company's offshore operations.                                  Page 10 of 32   In 1993:       Sales increased by 1.9% to $100.5 million in 1993.  The sales increases of the Electronic Products Segment and the Metallurgical Products Segment exceeded the sales decrease experienced by the End User/Finished Products Segment.      The backlog on December 31, 1993 was $14.9 million, compared to $14.2 million on December 31, 1992.      The Electronic Products Segment sales increased to $9.4 million from $8.2 million in 1992.  Sales of the Metallurgical Products Segment increased to $63.9 million in 1993 from $60.4 million.  The 1993 year marked the first full year of operation at the Export, PA, facility which includes the product line acquired from Engelhard Corporation in August 1991 and relocated during 1992.  End User/Finished Products Segment sales decreased from $30 million to $27.1 million.  This reflected a volume decrease in currency counters and dispensers in the Products Division. Separately, that division withdrew as a provider of engineering services on a prime contract basis to an agency of the U.S. Government.  Also causing the sales decline of the segment were unfavorable currency translation of the sales of Lloyd Instruments Ltd., a U.K. Company, and a decrease in the sales of electronic products of Chatillon.      Total 1993 gross profit dollars approximated those of 1992.  However, as a percentage of sales, 1993 gross profit dropped slightly to 24.6% from 25.2% in 1992.  Contributing to the decrease were inventory write-offs and high production costs incurred at the Export, PA, facility of the Metallurgical Products Segment and the cost associated with the Petersburg, PA, plant shutdown of the Electronic Products Segment.      Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $19.4 million in 1993, compared to $20 million during the previous year.  The decrease reflected the non-recurring 1992 expenses associated with AMI-DDC (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements) and relocating the Engelhard product line.      Operating Profit of $5.4 million in 1993 represented a 10.6% increase from year-to-year.  The Electronic Products Segment contributed to the increase, with the Components Division experiencing stronger profits in 1993 as a result of on-going cost reduction efforts.  The operating profit increase of the Metallurgical Products Segment included improved earnings of the established operations of AMI and the first full year of contribution of AMI-DDC exceeding a decrease in profitability on the part of the product line acquired from Engelhard.  The major markets of AMI remained cyclical and reflected general trends in housing, automotive, appliances and capital equipment.  Improved profits were realized by Chace, as cost improvement programs yielded their intended results.  Regarding the End User/Finished Products Segment, weak demand caused a decrease in profitability at the Products Division and flat earnings on certain Chatillon products, which more than offset improved profits realized by Lloyd Instruments Ltd.      Interest expense decreased to $0.4 million in 1993 due to lower interest rates and a reduction in the amount of debt outstanding.      Income tax expenses increased proportionate to 1993 pre-tax earnings, with the 35% effective income tax rate unchanged from the prior year. Contributing to the flat effective rate were increased earnings of the operation in Puerto Rico, which is exempt from U.S. Federal income taxes.      The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," during 1993.  As a result, $261,000 of favorable cumulative effect on prior years was added to 1993 net earnings.                                 Page 11 of 32   ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
