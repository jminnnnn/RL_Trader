ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         ----------------------------------------------------------------  Liquidity and Capital Resources - -------------------------------       Cash and cash equivalents totalled $13.9 million at December 31, 1995, compared to $8.7 million a year earlier.  Working capital was $43.2 million, compared to $32.7 million at December 31, 1994.  The financial performance during the fourth quarter of 1995, which included the operations of Pulse Engineering, Inc. ("Pulse"), contributed to the year-to-year increase in working capital.  Pulse was acquired at the end of September 1995 and the large increases in consolidated accounts receivable and inventory were due primarily to the Pulse balances acquired.  Pulse had a favorable working capital ratio prior to the acquisition and it remained strong subsequent to the acquisition.  Additional information regarding the Pulse acquisition is included in Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Cash provided by 1995 operating activities was $18.2 million.  The positive cash flow was composed mainly of net earnings of $9.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $6.2 million, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization amounts included three months of depreciation on the Pulse assets and three months of amortization of the goodwill resulting from the Pulse acquisition.  Significant decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets (excluding amounts acquired from Pulse) also provided cash during the year. Cash was provided by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.3 million while cash of $2.8 million was consumed by an increase in inventories. The increase in inventories includes amounts produced by the Electronic Components Segment, which includes Pulse, in anticipation of the Chinese New Year holiday in February 1996.  The Company's production operations in the Peoples Republic of China (the "PRC") and in Taiwan are typically closed for one to two weeks for this holiday and inventory is built in anticipation of the lost production time.       Investing activities consumed $11.6 million during 1995.  Capital expenditures constituted $5.9 million, excluding acquisitions. Separately, cash of $5.9 million was paid for the capital stock of Pulse stockholders, net of cash acquired.  The cash portion of the purchase price, including the cash paid to the former stockholders of Pulse and related acquisition costs, was approximately $27.6 million.  Cash acquired from Pulse and used to partially fund the acquisition was approximately $21.7 million.  Additional financing for the acquisition was provided by bank borrowings as described below. Projected 1996 capital expenditures are expected to be financed by internally generated funds.       Cash used in financing activities was a net $1.3 million.  Cash consumed by financing activities was due to combined debt reduction of $7.8 million and $2.5 million of dividend payments. It is expected that dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis during 1996.  Proceeds from long-term borrowings were $9.0 million.  The proceeds included $5.0 million which was used to finance the May 1995 purchase of warrants for Pulse common stock.  In connection with the September 1995 closing of the Pulse acquisition, an additional $4.0 million was borrowed under a bank syndicated credit facility which authorized Technitrol to borrow up to $50 million on an unsecured basis. Technitrol used approximately $18.0 million of this credit facility to refinance existing indebtedness (including the $5.0 million which had been borrowed to fund the Pulse warrant purchase in May 1995) and, separately, approximately $4.0 million of the credit facility to partially fund the acquisition costs and cash payments to former shareholders of Pulse.  On December 29, 1995, the credit facility was amended in conjunction with a partial repayment and the total facility was reduced to $45.0 million. Further payments in advance of the due date were made in February and March of 1996 in amounts of $6.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively.  Approximately $3.6 million (before payment of related transaction expenses and costs) was received at the end of February 1996 from the sale of the Products Division as explained in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  A portion of these funds were applied in March, as aforementioined, to pay off all amounts outstanding under the line of credit.  The balance of the funds received will be used for general working capital purposes.                                   Page 9 of 38       The Company's foreign sales are conducted primarily through its foreign subsidiaries, principally in the Far East and Europe.  In the Far East, the Company's sales are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars.  In Europe, sales are denominated in local currencies (consisting mainly of English pounds and French francs) and in U.S. dollars.  Since a very significant portion of the Company's foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, the Company does not believe that its potential exposure to currency fluctuations is material to its business.  During 1994, the Company did not purchase any currency exchange forward contracts or similar instruments generally utilized to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations. During 1995, a limited number of short-term forward contracts were purchased by a Pulse subsidiary in Europe.  All such contracts were closed prior to the end of the year.  These contracts are purchased in order to guarantee a predetermined currency exchange rate at the time the contract is purchased by transferring the risk or benefit of currency fluctuations to a third party.       Slightly more than one-quarter of the Company's identifiable assets are located in the Far East and significant sales and operating profits are generated in that region.  (See the geographic segment data included in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)  The Company's operations in the region include manufacturing plants in the PRC, Taiwan and the Philippines.  If unfavorable political, economic or other events occur in that region, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and capital resources.  Management monitors events in the region and takes steps to reduce the risk of uncertainty when possible.

The increase was largely due to the sales of Pulse, acquired at the end of September 1995.  The Pulse sales included in the consolidated results of the Company were approximately $25.4 million. The sales increases of the Electronic Components Segment (which includes Pulse) and the Test & Measurement Products Segment exceeded a sales decrease experienced by the Metallurgical Products Segment.  The Company's backlog at December 31, 1995 was $55.9 million, including $28.2 million for Pulse.                                 Page 10 of 38       The sales of the Electronic Components Segment increased from $41.2 million in 1994 to $68.4 million in 1995.  The Fil-Mag Group and Pulse, along with the Components Division of the Company, have been combined into one world-wide operation serving the needs of the local area network (LAN) and telecommunications marketplaces.  In addition to the Pulse sales noted above, sales of the Fil-Mag Group increased during the year.  The lower sales level of the Components Division, which was caused by a decline in domestic demand for that Division's products, was more than offset by increased demand for products manufactured by Fil-Mag and Pulse.  The strong demand of these markets for products produced by Pulse and the Fil-Mag Group continued into the beginning of 1996, as evidenced by solid backlog and order levels at the end of 1995.  Operating profits for the Segment in 1995 were $10.7 million compared to $5.0 million in 1994. The sales and operating profits of the Segment included three months of Pulse activity.       The Metallurgical Products Segment experienced a number of challenges during 1995 and the sales and operating profits of this Segment were lower than the 1994 levels.  Sales in 1995 were $75.3 million, down from $76.5 million in 1994.  A sales decrease at Advanced Metallurgy, Inc. ("AMI") exceeded a sales increase at Chace Precision Metals, Inc. ("Chace").  The sales of AMI and, to a lesser extent, Chace are affected by general trends in the domestic economy, particularly those in housing, automotive, appliances and capital equipment markets.  During the second half of 1995, there was a softening in demand for the products of this Segment.  In addition, the Segment's operating profits were negatively impacted by increased price competition and rapidly escalating raw material costs, particularly in the nonprecious metals markets.  Management has focused significant attention on attaining increased manufacturing efficiencies and has implemented a partial pass-through of the raw material price changes by way of both a price increase and a metals factor. Operating profits of the Segment were $1.8 million in 1995, down from $4.8 million in 1994.       In the Test & Measurement Products Segment, sales increases at John Chatillon & Sons, Inc. ("Chatillon") and Lloyd Instruments, Inc. ("Lloyd") exceeded a sales decrease at the Products Division.  That sales decrease was primarily caused by weak domestic demand for the currency counters and dispensers manufactured by the Products Division.  The February 1996 sale of the Products Division evidenced management's intention to focus on the test and measurement product lines within this Segment.  Relative to the 1995 results, Lloyd in particular contributed to the higher sales and operating profits of the Segment.  The 1995 Lloyd sales included a full year of the sales of Erichsen, a German subsidiary acquired late in 1994.  Chatillon's sales benefited from recent product development efforts. Sales for the Segment increased from $28.7 million in 1994 to $32.8 million in 1995 while operating profits increased from $2.7 million to $2.9 million.  Cost of Sales - -------------      In 1995, the Company's gross margin increased by 6%, from 29.6% of sales in 1994 to 31.5% in 1995. This margin increase was driven primarily by the strong product demand and increased manufacturing efficiencies within the Electronic Components Segment.  These gains offset the lower gross profits of the Metallurgical Products Segment which experienced significant decreases in gross profits versus the prior year, with the majority of the gross profit decline occurring at AMI.  The softer demand, increased price competition and rising metal costs noted above caused this decline.  Operating Expenses - ------------------      The Company's selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $40.2 million in 1995 from $30.8 million in 1994.  This represented 22.8% of sales in 1995 and 21.0% of sales in 1994.  The increase was primarily caused by the addition of Pulse for the fourth quarter.  Interest - --------      Interest expense increased from $1.1 million in 1994 to $1.4 million in 1995 reflecting the incremental borrowing related to the Pulse acquisition.                                 Page 11 of 38 Income Taxes - ------------      The Company's effective income tax rate declined to 36% in 1995 from 39% in 1994.  During 1995, proportionately higher taxable income was earned by the Company's foreign operations, which generally have lower tax rates than the domestic operations.       During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("FAS123").  Under the new standard, companies have the option of including certain stock-based compensation in the company's statement of earnings or, alternately, providing disclosure of the related compensation amounts in a note to the financial statements.  The new disclosures apply to financial statements for years beginning after December 15, 1995.   The Company intends to adopt the disclosure alternative and does not expect FAS123 to have a material impact on its pro forma results of operations.  During 1995, the Company did not grant incentive stock options to employees. However, in connection with the acquisition of Pulse on September 29, 1995 (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements), outstanding options to purchase Pulse common stock were assumed by the Company and converted into options to purchase Technitrol common stock.  The difference between the exercise price and the market value of Technitrol stock at the date of acquisition was capitalized as part of the purchase price.  No additional options are expected to be issued under the assumed plans.  See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding stock-based compensation provided by the Company.       The Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.  1994 and 1993 - -------------  Revenues - --------      In 1994, consolidated sales were $146.4 million compared to $100.5 million in 1993. The 45.7% increase was due to the $30.8 million sales of the Fil-Mag Group, acquired in January 1994, and a combined sales increase of $15.1 million realized by the other businesses of the Company.  All three of the Company's segments experienced increased sales in 1994 from 1993.       The December 31 backlog was $28.7 million in 1994 and $14.9 million in 1993.  Contributing to the increase was the Fil-Mag Group's backlog.       The increase in sales of the Electronic Components Segment to $41.2 million included the sales of the Fil-Mag Group as noted above.  Operating profit of the Electronics Components Segment increased to $5.0 million in 1994, compared to $1.7 million in the prior year.  The increase reflected the fifty weeks of profits of the Fil-Mag Group since its acquisition in January 1994.  As a percentage of sales, this segment's annual operating profits equaled 12.2% which was the highest of the Company's three product segments. Year end backlog and order volumes indicated a softening in the segment's domestic markets, while offshore demand remained relatively strong.       The Metallurgical Products Segment produced increased sales, operating profit and operating profit as a function of sales in 1994 as compared to 1993. AMI experienced its largest sales and profit improvements to the product line which was acquired from Engelhard Corporation in 1991. Housing starts continued to have an eventual impact on demand for various AMI products.  Management monitored the indirect effect that interest rate increases had on AMI backlog levels which were stable entering the first quarter of 1995.  Separately, Chace sales and operating profits also grew year-to-year.  On-going efforts aimed at cost containment and quality improvements contributed to the growth in sales volume and profits. Chace's proven ability to compete in a demanding industrial market was reflected by a strong backlog position as it began 1995.                                 Page 12 of 38       Two of the three operating units within the Test & Measurement Products Segment experienced an increase in sales and operating profits. Chatillon sales volume and profitability improved in its primary product families, as the improved economic climate contributed to more favorable market conditions.  Lloyd's year-to-year sales increase reflected incremental unit sales and the absence of the unfavorable currency translation which negatively impacted 1993 results.  Lower sales and operating profit occurred at the Company's Products Division.  Domestic demand for currency counters and dispensers decreased during 1994, which was also the first full year subsequent to the Division withdrawing as a provider of engineering services on a prime contract basis to an agency of the U.S. Government.  Cost of Sales - -------------      In 1994, the Company's overall gross margin increased to 29.6% of sales from 26.9% in 1993.  Improvements were made in each of the Company's three business segments.  The addition of the Fil-Mag Group within the Electronic Components Segment, cost containment and quality improvements within the Metallurgical Products Segment and the higher sales of Chatillon and Lloyd included in the Test & Measurement Products Segment all contributed to a higher gross margin in 1994.  Operating Expense - -----------------      The Company's selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $30.8 million in 1994 from $21.6 million in 1993. The key reason for the increase was the addition of the Fil-Mag Group.  Interest - --------      Interest expense grew to $1.1 million, caused by the $10 million increase in outstanding debt to fund the Fil-Mag Group acquisition and rising interest rates during the year.  Income Taxes - ------------      1994 income tax expenses increased as a function of pre-tax earnings. The 1994 effective income tax rate rose to 39% from 35% in 1993 as a result of proportionately higher taxable income being earned by the Company's domestic operations. Effective income tax rates of the domestic operations generally exceed those of the Company's offshore operations.  ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
