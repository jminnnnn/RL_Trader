Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Introduction        This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as well as other sections of this report, contain certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in "Risk Factors" section of this report on page 7 through 13.  Critical Accounting Policies        The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 38 through 39 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for inventory valuation, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, severance and asset impairment expense, income taxes, and contingency accruals. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.        Inventory Valuation. Inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts estimated by taking into account actual purchases of our products over the recent past and customer forecasts. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and or customer requirements, we may be required to write down our inventory and our gross margin could be negatively affected. If we were to sell or use a significant portion of inventory already written down, our gross margin could be positively affected.        Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles. We assess the carrying cost of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances. In addition, in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangibles.        Severance and Asset Impairment Expense. Our recent restructuring activities are designed to reduce both our fixed and variable costs, particularly in response to the dramatically reduced demand for our products in the electronics components industry in the 2001 to 2002 period and on-going price competition in both segments. These costs included the closing of facilities and the termination of employees. Acquisition-related costs are included in the allocation of the cost of the acquired business. Other restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incur those costs, and all of the requirements for accrual are met in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. Restructuring costs are recorded based upon our best estimates at the time such as estimated residual values. Our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs. If this occurs, we adjust our initial estimates in future periods. In the case of acquisition-related restructuring costs, depending on whether the assets impacted came from the acquired entity and the timing of the restructuring charge, such adjustment would generally require a change in value of the goodwill appearing on our balance sheet, which may not affect our earnings. In the case of other restructuring costs, we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods if our initial estimates were too low, or reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially if our initial estimates were too high.        Income Taxes. Except in limited circumstances, we have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings as calculated for income tax purposes. In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes - Special Areas ("APB 23") we intend to reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. indefinitely. If we encounter a significant domestic need for liquidity that we cannot fulfill through borrowings, equity offerings, or other internal or external sources, we may experience unfavorable tax consequences as cash invested outside the U.S. is transferred to the U.S. This adverse consequence would occur if the transfer of cash into the U.S. were subject to income tax without sufficient foreign tax credits available to offset the U.S. tax liability.                                    Page 17 of 60         Contingency Accruals. During the normal course of business, a variety of issues may arise, which may result in litigation, environmental compliance and other contingent obligations. In developing our contingency accruals we consider both the likelihood of a loss or incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of exposure. We record contingency accruals when a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We periodically evaluate available information to assess whether contingency accruals should be adjusted. We could be required to record additional expenses in future periods if our initial estimates were too low, or reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially if our estimates were too high.  Overview        We are a global producer of precision-engineered passive magnetics-based electronic components and electrical contact products and materials. We believe we are a leading global producer of these products and materials in the primary markets we serve based on our estimates of the size of our primary markets in annual revenues and our share of those markets relative to our competitors.              We operate our business in two distinct segments:        o     the electronic components segment, which operates under the name             Pulse, and        o     the electrical contact products segment, which operates under the             name AMI Doduco.        General. We define net sales as gross sales less returns and allowances. We sometimes refer to net sales as revenue. From 1997 through 2000, the growth in our consolidated net sales was due in large part to the growth of Pulse. However, beginning in late 2000, the electronics markets served by Pulse experienced a severe global contraction. In late 2002, many of these markets began to stabilize or increase in terms of unit sales. However, because of excess capacity, relocation by customers from North America and Europe to the Far East, and emergence of strong competitors in the Far East, the pricing environment for Pulse's products has been and remains challenging. We believe that a broad-based market rebound in terms of pricing power will be erratic and gradual, probably requiring several years. In markets where unit demand has begun to recover, downward pressure on selling prices has kept total revenue from growing proportionately with unit growth.        Demand at AMI Doduco typically mirrors the prevailing economic conditions in North America and Europe. This is true for electrical contacts, and for component subassemblies for automotive applications such as multi-function switches, motor control sensors and ignition security systems, and for non-automotive uses such as appliance and industrial controls. AMI Doduco continues its cost reduction actions including work force adjustments and plant consolidations in line with demand around the world.        In 2002, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $15.7 million, net of income tax benefit, related to AMI Doduco as a cumulative effect of accounting change. We also recorded a trade name impairment charge of $32.1 million, less a $12.8 million income tax benefit, related to Pulse.        Historically, the gross margin at Pulse has been significantly higher than at AMI Doduco. As a result, the mix of net sales generated by Pulse and AMI Doduco during a period affects our consolidated gross margin. Over the past two years, our gross margin has been positively impacted by the savings from our various restructuring activities and ongoing cost and expense controls. Our gross margin is also significantly affected by capacity utilization, particularly at AMI Doduco. Pulse's markets are characterized by a relatively short-term product life cycle compared to AMI Doduco. As a result, significant product turnover occurs each year. Therefore, Pulse's changes in average selling prices do not necessarily provide a meaningful and quantifiable measure of Pulse's operations. AMI Doduco has a relatively long-term and mature product line, without significant turnover, and with less frequent variation in the prices of product sold, unlike Pulse, where fixed-term price contracts are rare. Most of AMI Doduco's products are sold under annual (or longer) purchase contracts. Therefore, AMI Doduco's revenues historically have not been subject to significant price fluctuations. Sales growth and contraction at AMI Doduco is generally attributable to changes in unit volume, as well as foreign exchange rates, especially the U.S. dollar to the euro, since the functional currency is the euro for a majority of AMI Doduco's business, but results of the business are reported in U.S. dollars.        Acquisitions. Historically, acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy. In many cases, our move into new and high-growth extensions of our existing product lines or markets has been facilitated by an acquisition. Our acquisitions continually change the mix of our net sales. Pulse made numerous acquisitions in recent years which have increased our penetration into our primary markets and expanded our presence in new markets. Recent examples of these acquisitions include Excelsus and the consumer electronics business of Eldor Corporation.                                    Page 18 of 60   Excelsus was acquired in August 2001 for approximately $85.9 million, net of cash acquired. Excelsus was based in Carlsbad, California and was a leading producer of customer-premises digital subscriber line filters and other broadband accessories. Pulse acquired Eldor's consumer electronics business in January 2003 for approximately $83.9 million. Eldor is headquartered in Senna Comasco, Italy with production operations in Istanbul and Izmir, Turkey. Eldor's consumer business is a leading supplier of flyback transformers to the European television industry.        Similarly, AMI Doduco has made a number of acquisitions over the years. In January 2001, AMI Doduco acquired the electrical contact and materials business of Engelhard-CLAL, a manufacturer of electrical contacts, wire and strip contact materials and related products. Generally, AMI Doduco's acquisitions have been driven by our strategy of expanding our product and geographical market presence for electrical contact products.        Due to our integration of acquisitions and the interchangeable sources of net sales between existing and acquired operations, historically, we have not separately tracked the net sales of an acquisition after the date of the transaction.        Technology. Our business is continually affected by changes in technology, design, and preferences of consumers and other end users of our products, as well as changes in regulatory requirements. We address these changes by continuing to invest in new product development and by maintaining a diverse product portfolio which contains both mature and emerging technologies in order to meet to customer demands.        Management Focus. Our executives focus on a number of important factors in evaluating our financial condition and operation performance. We use economic profit which we define as operating profit after tax, less our cost of capital. Revenue growth, gross margin as a percentage of revenue, and operating profit as a percent of revenue are also among these factors. Operating leverage or incremental operating profit as a percentage of incremental sales is a factor that is discussed frequently with analysts and investors, as this is believed to represent the benefit of absorbing fixed overhead and operating expenses, and increased profitability on higher sales. In evaluating working capital management, liquidity and cash flow, our executives also use performance measures such as days sales outstanding, days payable outstanding and inventory turnover.        The continued success of our business is largely dependent of meeting and exceeding our customer's expectations. Non-financial performance measures such as safety statistics, on-time delivery and quality statistics assist our management in monitoring this activity on an on-going basis.        Recent Cost Reduction Programs. During 1999 and 2000, the electronic components industries served by Pulse were characterized by unprecedented growth. Beginning in late 2000 and continuing all during 2001 and a significant part of 2002, however, the opposite trend was experienced as these industries experienced a severe worldwide contraction and many of our customers canceled orders and decreased their level of business activity as a result of lower demand for their end products. Our manufacturing business model at Pulse legacy has a very high variable cost component due to the labor-intensity of many processes, which allows us to quickly change our capacity based on market demand. Just as we expanded capacity during 1999 and 2000, we reduced capacity during 2001 and 2002. The Pulse Consumer Division, acquired from Eldor in 2003 however, is capital intensive and therefore more sensitive to volume changes. Generally speaking, during the twelve months ended December 26, 2003, Pulse's end markets experienced increased unit demand, but the increasing presence of Far Eastern competition also increased pricing pressure, which in turn put pressure on Pulse to reduce selling prices. Unit sales and pricing pressures were, however, not uniform across all product lines, making product mix an important factor in revenue generation. While the electrical contact industry served by AMI Doduco is generally less dependent on volatile technology markets, it too was negatively impacted by general economic trends as reflected in slower overall construction spending and reduced capital spending in 2001 and 2002. AMI Doduco has a higher fixed cost component of manufacturing activity than Pulse, as it is more capital intensive. Therefore, AMI Doduco is unable to expand or contract its capacity as quickly as Pulse in response to market demand, although significant actions have been taken to align AMI Doduco's capacity with current market demand.        In response to the decline in demand for our products, we implemented a succession of cost reduction initiatives and programs, summarized as follows:        During 2003, we accrued $9.0 million in the aggregate for severance and related payments and asset impairments. At Pulse, we accrued $1.5 million for the elimination of certain manufacturing and support positions located in France, the United Kingdom, Mexico and China and $0.7 million for other facility exit costs. We                                    Page 19 of 60   additionally accrued $1.9 million for shutdown of Pulse's manufacturing facility in Mexico and $0.5 million to write down carrying cost of Pulse's facility in the Philippines which is held for sale. At AMI Doduco, we accrued $2.9 million for the elimination of certain manufacturing positions principally located in North America and Germany and $1.5 million to complete the shutdown of a redundant facility in Spain that we acquired from Engelhard-CLAL in 2001. The majority of these accruals are expected to be utilized by the end of 2004.        During 2002, we announced the closure of our production facility in the Philippines. The production at this facility was transferred to other Pulse facilities in Asia. We recorded charges of $3.8 million for this plant closing, comprising $1.4 million for severance and related payments and $2.4 million for asset writedowns. The majority of this accrual was utilized by the end of 2002. We also adopted other restructuring plans during 2002. In this regard, we recorded provisions of $6.0 million for personnel reductions, and substantially all of the employee severance and related payments in connection with these actions were completed as of December 26, 2003. An additional provision of $7.0 million was recorded in 2002 related to asset writedowns. These assets were primarily Asian-based production equipment that became idle in 2002.        During 2001, we announced the closure of our production facilities in Thailand and Malaysia. The production at these two facilities was transferred to other Pulse facilities in Asia. We recorded charges of $3.6 million for these plant closings, comprised of $2.5 million for severance and related payments and $1.1 million for other exit costs. The majority of this accrual was utilized by the end of 2002. We also adopted other restructuring plans during 2001. In this regard, provisions of $6.4 million were recorded during 2001. Termination costs for employees at our Thailand and Malaysian facilities have been included in the separate provisions for exiting those facilities. In addition to these terminations, headcount was reduced by approximately 12,300, net of new hires, during fiscal 2001 through voluntary employee attrition and involuntary workforce reductions primarily at manufacturing facilities in the PRC where severance payments are not necessary. In addition, a charge of $3.5 million was recorded during 2001 to writedown the value of certain Pulse fixed assets to their disposal value.        As a result of our continuing focus on both economic and operating profit, we will continue to aggressively size both Pulse and AMI Doduco so that costs are optimally matched to current and anticipated future revenue and unit demand, and as we pursue additional growth opportunities. The amounts of additional charges will depend on specific actions taken. The actions taken over the past three years such as plant closures, plant relocations, asset impairments and reduction in personnel worldwide have resulted in the elimination of a variety of costs. The majority of these costs represent the annual salaries and benefits of terminated employees, both those directly related to manufacturing and those providing selling, general and administrative services, as well as lower overhead costs related to factory relocations. The eliminated costs also include depreciation savings from disposed equipment.        International Operations. An increasing percentage of our sales in recent years has been outside of the United States. As of December 26, 2003, we had manufacturing operations in 10 countries and we have significant net sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 26, 2003, 76% of our net sales were outside of the U.S. For the year ended December 27, 2002, 68.7% of our net sales were to customers outside of the U.S. Changing exchange rates often impact our financial results and the analysis of our period-over-period results. This is particularly true of movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. AMI Doduco's European sales are denominated primarily in euro. A portion of Pulse's European sales are also denominated in euros. However, the proportion at Pulse is less than it is at AMI Doduco, although Pulse's portion increased with the acquisition of its new Consumer Division, which sells to its customers primarily in euros. Prior to the acquisition of the Consumer Division, Pulse used the U.S. dollar as its functional currency in Europe while AMI Doduco uses the euro. For the acquired Consumer Division from Eldor, Pulse uses the euro as its functional currency. The use of different functional currencies creates different financial effects. AMI Doduco's and Pulse's Consumer Division euro-denominated sales and earnings may result in higher or lower dollar sales upon translation for our U.S. consolidated financial statements. We may also experience a positive or negative translation adjustment to equity because our investment in Pulse's Consumer Division and AMI Doduco's European operations may be worth more or less in U.S. dollars after translation for our U. S. consolidated financial statements. The Pulse legacy operations may incur foreign currency gains or losses as euro-denominated transactions are remeasured to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. If an increasing percentage of our sales is denominated in non-U.S. currencies, increased exposure to currency fluctuations may result.        In order to reduce our exposure resulting from currency fluctuations, we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts and/or currency options. These contracts guarantee a predetermined range of exchange rates at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. As of December 26, 2003, we had two foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately 70.6 million of euro in order to hedge intercompany loans. In determining                                    Page 20 of 60   the use of forward exchange contracts and currency options, we consider the amount of sales, purchases and net assets or liabilities denominated in local currencies, the type of currency, and the costs associated with the contracts.        Precious Metals. AMI Doduco uses silver, as well as other precious metals, in manufacturing some of its electrical contacts, contact materials and contact subassemblies. Historically, we have leased or held these materials through consignment arrangements with our suppliers. Leasing and consignment costs have been typically below the costs to borrow funds to purchase the metals, and more importantly, these arrangements eliminate the fluctuations in the market price of owned precious metal and enable us to minimize our inventories. AMI Doduco's terms of sale generally allow us to charge customers for precious metal content based on market value of precious metal on the day after shipment to the customer. Thus far we have been successful in managing the costs associated with our precious metals. While limited amounts are purchased for use in production, the majority of our precious metal inventory continues to be leased or held on consignment. If our leasing/consignment fees increase significantly in a short period of time, and we are unable to recover these increased costs through higher sale prices, a negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity may result. Leasing/consignment fee increases are caused by increases in interest rates or increases in the price of the consigned material. See additional discussion in note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.        Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in high-tax jurisdictions such as Germany and the income earned in low-tax jurisdictions, particularly Izmir, Turkey and the PRC. This mix of income can vary significantly from one period to another. We have benefited over recent years from favorable tax treatments outside of the U.S. However, there is no guarantee as to how long these benefits will continue to exist.        Except in limited circumstances, we have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on our non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings (as calculated for income tax purposes) as per Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes - Special Areas. Such earnings include pre-acquisition earnings of foreign entities acquired through stock purchases, and are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $299.4 million of our non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings (as calculated for income tax purposes) as of December 26, 2003, as per APB 23. Unrecognized deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings are estimated to be approximately $94.2 million. Where excess cash has accumulated in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and it is advantageous for tax reasons, subsidiary earnings may be repatriated.  Results of Operations        Year ended December 26, 2003 compared to the year ended December 27, 2002        Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended December 26, 2003 increased $102.8 million, or 25.3%, to $509.2 million from $406.4 million in the year ended December 27, 2002. Our sales increase from the comparable period last year was primarily attributable to the increases from the Eldor acquisition and stronger sales of Pulse's legacy products, tempered by ongoing pressure on selling prices at Pulse, and to a lesser extent, weaker demand at AMI Doduco, which resulted in lower sales of electrical contacts and contact materials on a constant-euro basis.        Pulse's net sales increased $89.5 million, or 43.7%, to $294.1 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 from $204.6 million in the year ended December 27, 2002. Most of the increase is attributable to sales of Eldor since the date of acquisition in January 2003. Increased unit revenues in many Pulse legacy product lines were somewhat offset by our average selling price pressures.        AMI Doduco's net sales increased $13.4 million, or 6.6%, to $215.2 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 from $201.8 million in the year ended December 27, 2002. Sales in the 2003 period reflect weak North American and European markets, which were more than offset by the positive translation effect of an increase in the average euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate during the period. Lower net sales in local currencies, primarily euros, resulted from lower manufacturing activity by customers in the commercial and industrial machinery and non-residential construction end markets.        Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales increased $66.1 million, or 21.3%, to $375.9 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 from $309.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2002, which did not include Pulse's Consumer Division. Our consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 26, 2003 was 26.2% compared to 23.8% for the year ended December 27, 2002. Our consolidated gross margin in 2003 was positively affected by:                                    Page 21 of 60         o     a mix of net sales weighted more toward Pulse, whose products             typically have a higher gross margin than those of AMI Doduco,        o     the addition of the Pulse Consumer Division products, which             typically have a higher gross margin than AMI Doduco products and             some Pulse legacy products, and        o     better capacity utilization and lower per-unit overhead costs at             Pulse in 2003 than in 2002.        These positive impacts on gross margin in 2003 were partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies at AMI Doduco due to under-utilization of capacity and continued consolidation activities in European, Asian and North American manufacturing facilities.        Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 26, 2003 increased $9.9 million, or 11.1%, to $99.2 million or 19.5% of net sales, from $89.3 million or 22.0% of net sales, for the year ended December 27, 2002. The increase in the 2003 period compared to the 2002 period is primarily attributable to an increase of $4.2 million in incentive and stock compensation expense reflecting higher levels of profitability, and $2.4 million of intangible asset amortization related to the Eldor acquisition. The addition of Eldor expenses and the higher translated U.S. dollar cost of euro-denominated expenses were offset in part by savings from restructuring actions that we took over the last year to reduce costs and tighten spending.        Research, development and engineering expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. For the year ended December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002 respectively, RD&E by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):                                                   2003               2002                                                  ----               ----       Pulse                                    $14,439            $13,892       Percentage of segment sales                  4.9%               6.8%        AMI Doduco                               $ 4,030            $ 3,903       Percentage of segment sales                  1.9%               1.9%        Although some consolidation of RD&E, particularly design activity, has occurred through restructuring and relocation activities at Pulse, we have minimized spending cuts in the RD&E area as we believe that future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next-generation products. Design and development activities with our OEM customers continued at an aggressive pace during 2003. The change in RD&E as a percentage of sales at Pulse relates to the effect of the acquisition of Eldor, as Eldor incurs lower RD&E costs relative to its sales as compared to Pulse legacy products.        Interest. Net interest expense was $0.8 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 compared to net interest expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 27, 2002. The increase in net interest expense in the current period is due to lower yields on a lower average cash invested balance, which more than offset higher average outstanding bank debt and related interest expense in the prior year period. Bank debt in 2002 consisted of euro-denominated term loans which were paid off in July 2002, and credit facility debt from the Excelsus acquisition which was paid off in April 2002. Net interest expense also includes interest on our precious metal leases and commitment fees on our unused credit facility.        Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 26, 2003 was 20.0% compared to 30.8% in the form of a benefit for the year ended December 27, 2002. While the prior year's rate reflects a tax benefit recorded in connection with the trade name impairment write-off, the tax rate in 2003 resulted from a higher portion of income being attributable to low-tax jurisdictions, combined with restructuring expenses of AMI Doduco which yielded tax benefits in high-tax jurisdictions.        Equity method investment loss. We acquired 19.5% of Full Rise Electronics Co. Ltd. ("FRE") in 2001, and an additional 10% in 2002. Shares of FRE began trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in January of 2003, and they have experienced considerable price volatility. We recorded a net loss on equity method investments of $8.7 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 compared to equity method investments earnings of $0.3 million for the year ended December 27, 2002. The net loss in 2003 resulted from a $9.3 million charge to the original cost basis of our investment, offset by $0.6 million of equity method investment earnings in 2003. We maintain an option to acquire a controlling interest in FRE at its market value at the time of exercise.                                    Page 22 of 60       Year ended December 27, 2002 compared to the year ended December 28, 2001        Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended December 27, 2002 decreased $67.9 million, or 14.3%, to $406.4 million from $474.2 million for the year ended December 28, 2001. Our sales decline from the comparable period last year was attributable primarily to declining average selling prices, especially in Pulse's power conversion and telecom markets, and the precipitous global downturn in markets served by Pulse that began late in 2000, as a large portion of the strong sales in the first quarter of 2001 were for products ordered in 2000. Factors contributing to the downturn included declining capital expenditures by end-users and subsequent excess inventory levels. This downturn was experienced primarily in Pulse's networking and telecommunications markets on a worldwide basis, particularly in North America and Europe. Offsetting the sales declines in 2002 were the full year results of acquisitions completed in 2001.        Pulse's net sales decreased $48.7 million, or 19.2%, to $204.6 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 from $253.3 million for the year ended December 28, 2001. Although Pulse's sales were fairly consistent in the last nine months of 2002 and 2001, Pulse's sales were significantly lower in the first quarter of 2002 compared to the first quarter of 2001. The majority of Pulse sales during the quarter ended March 30, 2001 were for products ordered in 2000, before the dramatic market slowdown began. During the first quarter of 2001, new order rates declined and significant customer order cancellations occurred. Average selling prices also declined throughout 2002 compared to 2001, especially in Pulse's power conversion and telecom markets. Net sales in 2002 also include full year results of Grupo ECM and Excelsus sales, whereas 2001 included only sales derived from Grupo ECM and Excelsus since the date of their acquisition in March and August 2001, respectively.        AMI Doduco's net sales decreased $19.1 million, or 8.7%, to $201.8 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 from $220.9 million for the year ended December 28, 2001. Although AMI Doduco's sales were fairly consistent in the last nine months of 2002 and 2001 respectively, AMI Doduco's sales were significantly lower in the first quarter of 2002 compared to the first quarter of 2001. Sales in the 2002 period reflect very weak European markets, offset somewhat by a stronger average euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate on a year-over-year basis. Demand in North American markets was also lower throughout 2002 versus 2001, although the decline was not as severe as in Europe. The lower worldwide manufacturing activity in 2002 resulted in lower net sales primarily from customers in the commercial and industrial machinery, non-residential construction, and appliance industries in 2002.        Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales decreased $49.8 million, or 13.9%, to $309.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 from $359.7 million for the year ended December 28, 2001. This decrease was due to a decrease in net sales in 2002 and a reduction in inventory write-offs of $18.1 million, from $20.3 million in 2001 versus $2.2 million in 2002. Our consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 27, 2002 was 23.8% compared to 24.2% for the year ended December 28, 2001. Since the Pulse gross profit as a percentage of sales is typically higher than that of AMI Doduco, our consolidated gross margin in 2002 was negatively affected by:        o     a mix of net sales weighted more heavily by AMI Doduco on a relative             basis,        o     a trend towards higher priced products with even higher costs for             certain Pulse products, such as filtered connectors replacing             discrete components, and        o     average per unit selling price declines for other Pulse products.  There were also manufacturing inefficiencies at both Pulse and AMI Doduco due to under-utilization of capacity as a result of the market downturn. These factors more than offset the positive impact of our restructuring initiatives.        Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 27, 2002 decreased $9.6 million, or 9.7%, to $89.3 million, or 22.0% of net sales, from $98.8 million, or 20.8% net of sales for the year ended December 28, 2001. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 was due primarily to actions that we took to reduce costs and tighten spending controls. In addition, selling expenses, which are largely variable with net sales, decreased $2.0 million from 2001 to 2002. Administrative expenses decreased by $5.8 million, due largely to lower headcount in the U.S. and lower incentive awards, offset somewhat by higher expenses related to our restricted stock plan in 2002. Research, development and engineering expense decreased by $2.4 million, due largely to consolidation of research facilities.        Research, development and engineering expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. For the years ended December 27, 2002 and December 28, 2001, RD&E by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):                                    Page 23 of 60                                              2002          2001                                            ----          ----        Pulse                              $13,892       $16,026       Percentage of segment sales            6.8%          6.3%        AMI Doduco                         $ 3,903       $ 4,155       Percentage of segment sales            1.9%          1.9%        Although 2002 had been characterized by cost reduction activities and lower sales levels, particularly at Pulse, we largely avoided spending cuts in the RD&E area, as we believe that future demand in the electronic components markets will be driven by next-generation products. Design and development activities with our OEM customers continued at an aggressive pace during 2002. The reduced expense in RD&E in 2002 was primarily attributable to facility consolidation.        Interest. Net interest expense was $0.1 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 compared to $1.4 million of net interest income for the year ended December 28, 2001. This decrease was due to significantly lower yields on invested cash, somewhat offset by lower borrowing costs attributable to lower average outstanding debt in 2002. We incurred debt of approximately $74.0 million in connection with the acquisition of Excelsus in August 2001. Some of this debt remained outstanding until April 2002, when the balance was retired with proceeds from our follow-on offering. Invested cash balances increased by $62.8 million from year end 2001, due primarily to 2002 follow-on offering proceeds of $134.7 million less debt repayments of $75.3 million, coupled with an intense focus on cash and working capital management throughout 2002.        Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate in the form of a benefit for the year ended December 27, 2002 was 30.8% compared to 51.0% for the year ended December 28, 2001. The lower tax rate in 2002 was the result of a higher weighting of Pulse taxable income versus AMI Doduco, as Pulse generally operates in lower tax jurisdictions than AMI Doduco. There was also a higher level of non-deductible restructuring charges incurred in 2001 versus 2002. Specifically, plant shut-down costs and severance expenses were incurred in certain low-tax jurisdictions or countries where we had current losses or discontinued operations. In such countries, we expect to have no future income to offset such charges, resulting in little or no income tax benefit.        Severance and Asset Impairment Expense. During 2002, we recorded a charge of $32.1 million, less a related $12.8 million income tax benefit, attributable to a write down of the Excelsus trade name acquired by Pulse. The trade name impairment charge was triggered by the combined effect of reorganizing Pulse into product line based organization and updated forecast for digital subscriber line microfilters to which the trade name applies. A total of $1.9 million was also recognized as unusual and infrequent income in 2002, attributable to the favorable outcome of certain legal matters.        Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change. During 2002, we recorded a cumulative effective of accounting change of $15.7 million, net of income tax benefit, upon adoption of SFAS 142. This charge was attributable to impairment of AMI Doduco goodwill.  Liquidity and Capital Resources        Working capital as of December 26, 2003 was $199.8 million compared to $235.6 million as of December 27, 2002. This decrease was primarily due to the cash purchase of the Eldor business in January 2003, which reduced invested cash by $83.9 million at the time of the acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents, which is included in working capital, decreased from $205.1 million as of December 27, 2002 to $143.4 million as of December 26, 2003.        Net cash provided by operating activities was $55.2 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 and $20.8 million in the comparable period of 2002, an increase of $34.4 million. This increase was primarily attributable to the higher net earnings during the year ended December 26, 2003, higher depreciation and amortization expense with the addition of the Eldor business, and working capital reductions.        We present our statement of cash flows using the indirect method as permitted under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Our management has found that investors and analysts typically refer to changes in accounts receivable, inventory, and other components of working capital when analyzing operating cash flows. Also, changes in working capital are more directly related to the way we manage our business for cash flow, than are items such as cash receipts from the sale of goods, as would appear using the direct method.                                    Page 24 of 60         Capital expenditures were $7.8 million during the year ended December 26, 2003 and $5.8 million in the comparable period of 2002. We make capital expenditures to expand production capacity and to improve our operating efficiency. We plan to continue making such expenditures in the future as and when necessary.        We used $83.9 million in cash for acquisitions during the year ended December 26, 2003 and $6.7 million in the comparable period in 2002. The 2003 spending was for the acquisition of Eldor and the 2002 payments related to our investment in FRE. We may acquire other businesses or product lines to expand our breadth and scope of operations. We may exercise our option to expand our investment in FRE in the future.        We paid off two euro-denominated term loans during the year ended December 26, 2003 with $11.7 million of cash on hand. We have an obligation due in August 2009 under an unsecured term loan agreement with Sparkasse Pforzheim for the borrowing of approximately 5.1 million euros,.        As of December 26, 2003, we have no outstanding borrowings under our existing three-year revolving credit agreement. We entered into this credit agreement on June 20, 2001 providing for $225.0 million of credit capacity. Following the conclusion of our follow-on equity offering in April 2002, we voluntarily reduced the size of this credit facility to a maximum of $175.0 million, and then in March 2003, to a current maximum of $125.0 million. These reductions were made in order to reduce commitment fees and to size the facility to estimated future needs given cash on hand. We also amended the minimum net worth threshold from $275.0 million to $259.3 million as a result of a cumulative effect of an accounting change, recorded in the quarter ended March 29, 2002. As of December 26, 2003 the amended facility consisted of an aggregate U.S. dollar-based revolving line of credit in the principal amount of up to $125.0 million, including individual sub-limits of:        -     a British pounds sterling-based or euro-based revolving line of             credit in the principal amount of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent             of $75.0 million; and        -     a multicurrency facility providing for the issuance of letters of             credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed the U.S. dollar             equivalent of $10.0 million.        The amounts outstanding under the credit facility in total may not exceed $125.0 million. Outstanding borrowings are limited to a maximum of three times our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) on a rolling twelve-month basis as of the most recent quarter-end.        The credit facility also contains covenants requiring maintenance of minimum net worth, maximum debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined above, minimum interest expense coverage, capital expenditure limitations, and other customary and normal provisions. We are in compliance with all such covenants.        We pay a facility fee, irrespective of whether there are outstanding borrowings or not, which ranges from 0.275% to 0.450% of the total commitment, depending on our EBITDA. The interest rate for each currency's borrowing will be a combination of the base rate for that currency plus a credit margin spread. The base rate is different for each currency. It is LIBOR or prime rate for U.S. dollars, Euro-LIBOR for euros, and a rate approximating sterling LIBOR for British pounds. The credit margin spread is the same for each currency and is 0.850% to 1.425% depending on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Each of our domestic subsidiaries with net worth equal to or greater than $5 million has agreed to guarantee all obligations incurred under the credit facility.        We had four standby letters of credit outstanding at December 26, 2003 in the aggregate amount of $1.7 million securing transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business. We had commercial commitments outstanding at December 26, 2003 of approximately $60.6 million due under precious metal consignment-type leases. We had no other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements.        Our credit facility expires in June 2004. We expect to enter in to a new multi-year credit facility of similar size, terms and conditions before the expiration of the current credit facility.                                    Page 25 of 60         As of December 26, 2003, future payments related to contractual obligations were as follows (in thousands):                                                                Amounts due by period                                 Total      Less than 1 year      1 to 3 years    3 to 5 years    Thereafter                                 -----      ----------------      ------------    ------------    ----------                  Long-term debt          $ 6,837              $   127            $   259         $    84       $ 6,367       Operating leases         25,293                6,845              7,007           3,533         7,908                               -------              -------            -------         -------       -------                               $32,130              $ 6,972            $ 7,266         $ 3,617       $14,275         We believe that the combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future. In addition, we may use internally generated funds or borrowings or additional equity offerings for acquisitions of suitable businesses or assets.        All retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions as of December 26, 2003, with the exception of approximately $13.0 million of retained earnings primarily in the PRC, that are restricted in accordance with Section 58 of the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprises Law. The amount restricted in accordance with the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprise Law is applicable to all foreign investment enterprises doing business in the PRC. The restriction applies to 10% of our net earnings in the PRC, limited to 50% of the total capital invested in the PRC. We have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and none are foreseen. However, foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash movements from time to time. The retained earnings in other countries represent a material portion of our assets. We expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years will be abroad. If these earnings were brought back to the United States, significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the United States as several countries in which we operate have tax rates significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Additionally, we have not accrued U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on foreign earnings that have been indefinitely invested abroad.  New Accounting Pronouncements        In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity ("SFAS 150"), which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that falls within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Prior to issuance of FASB Staff Position FAS 150-3, Effective Date, Disclosures and Transition for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests under SFAS 150 ("FAS 150-3"), SFAS 150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, which for us was the quarter ended September 26, 2003. FAS 150-3 defers indefinitely the effective date of SFAS 150 for certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The adoption of this standard did not have and is not expected to have, as related to the deferred provisions, a material impact on our revenue, operating results, financial position or liquidity.        In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 149"), which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 requires that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly and clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component. SFAS 149 also amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to language used in FIN No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, with certain exceptions. We adopted SFAS. 149 as of June 1, 2003, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our revenue, operating results, financial position or liquidity.        In December 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46R"). FIN 46R clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a                                    Page 26 of 60   controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities which was issued in January 2003. We will be required to apply FIN 46R to variable interest in variable interest entities created after December 31, 2003. For variable interests in variable interest entities created before January 1, 2004, the interpretation will be applied no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. Adoption of this interpretation is not expected to effect on our revenue, operating results, financial position, or liquidity. We do not have any variable interest entities.  Recently Adopted Pronouncements.        In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure, an amendment to Statement No. 123 ("SFAS 148"). SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS 123"), by requiring prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements, about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, as of the beginning of our fiscal year in 2003. We used the prospective method of adoption, which recognizes expense for all employee awards granted, modified or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our revenue, operating results or liquidity. Net expense after related tax benefits lowered diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.01 per share in fiscal 2003.        In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees and Indebtedness of Others ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN 45 also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We were required to adopt the provisions of FIN 45 on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, although the related disclosure requirements were effective immediately. We have not issued any guarantees for performance of third parties. Accordingly, adoption of this interpretation had no effect on our revenue, operating results, financial position or liquidity.        In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities ("SFAS 146"). SFAS 146 superceded the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity, ("EITF 94-3") The principal difference between SFAS 146 and EITF 94-3 is that SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. As such, under SFAS 146, an entity's commitment to a plan by itself, does not create a present obligation meeting the definition of a liability. SFAS 146 also established fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 146 for all exit or disposal activities initiated after December 15, 2002. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our revenue operating results, financial position or liquidity, since our recent restructuring activities have generally been initiated and completed within a short period of time.        In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS 143") which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or) normal use of the assets. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss on settlement will be recognized. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 during the three months ending March 28, 2003. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our net sales, operating results, financial position, or liquidity.                                    Page 27 of 60   Item 7a Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk        Our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt, are exposed to changes in interest rates in both the U.S. and abroad. We invest our excess cash in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities. We generally limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extent practical. Our board has adopted policies relating to these risks, and continually monitors compliance with these policies.        Our existing credit facility has variable interest rates. Accordingly, interest expense may increase if we borrow and if the rates associated with our borrowings move higher. In addition, we may pursue additional or alternative financing for growth opportunities in one or both segments. We may use interest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates. However, we have not used any of these instruments to date.        The table below presents principal amounts in U.S. dollars (or equivalent U.S. dollars with respect to non-U.S. denominated debt) and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our foreign debt obligations. The column captioned "Approximate Fair Value" sets forth the carrying value of our long-term debt as of December 26, 2003, which approximates our fair value at such date after taking into consideration current rates offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. We do not hold or issue financial instruments or derivative financial instruments for trading purposes (dollars in thousands):                                                                                                              Approx.

However, we conduct business in various foreign currencies, including those of emerging market countries in Asia and well-developed European countries. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily forward exchange contracts in connection with fair value hedges, to manage foreign currency risks. In accordance with SFAS 133, gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognized in income along with adjustments of carrying amounts of the hedged items. Therefore, all of our forward exchange contracts are marked-to-market, and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income. These contracts guarantee a predetermined rate of exchange at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. We believe there are two potential risks of holding these instruments. The first is that the foreign currency being hedged could move in a direction which could create a better economic outcome than if hedging had not taken place. The second risk is that the counterparty to a currency hedge defaults on our obligations. We reduce the risk of counterparty default by entering into relatively short-term hedges with well capitalized and highly rated banks. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts, we consider the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies, the type of currency and the costs associated with the contracts. As of December 26, 2003, we had two foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to sell forward 70.6 million euro in order to hedge intercompany loans. The term of these contracts was approximately 30 days.        The table below provides information about our other non-derivative, non-U.S. dollar denominated financial instruments and presents the information in equivalent U.S. dollars. Amounts set forth under "Liabilities" represent principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our foreign currency debt obligations. The column captioned "Approximate Fair Value" sets forth the carrying value of our foreign currency long-term debt as of December 26, 2003, which approximates our fair value at such date after taking into consideration current rates offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities (dollars in thousands):                                    Page 28 of 60                                                                                                               Approx.
