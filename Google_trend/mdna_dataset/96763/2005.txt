Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Introduction        This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as well as other sections of this report, contain certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in "Risk Factors" section of this report on page 9 through 14.  Critical Accounting Policies        The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 41 through 42 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for inventory valuation, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, severance and asset impairment expense, income taxes, and contingency accruals. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.        Inventory Valuation. We carry our inventories at lower of cost or market. We establish inventory provisions to write down excess and obsolete inventory to market value. We utilize historical trends and customer forecasts to estimate expected usage of on-hand inventory. In addition, inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts estimated by taking into account actual sales of our products over recent historical periods and customer forecasts. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements, we may be required to write down our inventory and our gross margin could be negatively affected. Conversely, if we were to sell or use a significant portion of inventory already written down, our gross margin could be positively affected.        Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles. We assess the carrying cost of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances. This assessment is based on comparing fair value to carrying cost. Fair value is based on estimating future cash flows using various growth assumptions and discounting based on a present value factor. Assigning a useful life and periodically reassessing a remaining useful life (for purposes of systematic amortization) is also predicated on various economic assumptions. Our intangible assets are also subject to impairment as a result of other factors such as changing technology, declines in demand that lead to excess capacity and other factors. In addition to the various assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above, we may strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses in response to changes in industry or market conditions, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangibles.        Severance and Asset Impairment Expense. Acquisition-related costs are included in the allocation of the cost of the acquired business. Other restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incur those costs, and all of the requirements for accrual are met in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. We record severance, tangible asset and other restructuring charges such as lease terminations, in response to declines in demand that lead to excess capacity, changing technology and other factors. Restructuring costs are recorded based upon our best estimates at the time, such as estimated residual values. Our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs. If this occurs, we adjust our initial estimates in future periods. In the case of acquisition-related restructuring costs, depending on whether the assets impacted came from the acquired entity and the timing of the restructuring charge, such adjustment would generally require a change in value of the goodwill appearing on our balance sheet, which may not affect our earnings. In the case of other restructuring costs, we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods if our initial estimates were too low, or reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially if our initial estimates were too high.        Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. We must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a                                          18   deferred tax asset. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take in to account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.        Contingency Accruals. During the normal course of business, a variety of issues may arise, which may result in litigation, environmental compliance and other contingent obligations. In developing our contingency accruals we consider both the likelihood of a loss or incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of exposure. We record contingency accruals when a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We periodically evaluate available information to assess whether contingency accruals should be adjusted. Our evaluation includes an assessment of legal interpretations, judicial proceedings, recent case law and specific changes or developments regarding known claims. We could be required to record additional expenses in future periods if our initial estimates were too low, or reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially if our estimates were too high.  Overview        We are a global producer of precision-engineered passive magnetics-based electronic components and electrical contact products and materials. We believe we are a leading global producer of these products and materials in the primary markets we serve based on our estimates of the size of our primary markets in annual revenues and our share of those markets relative to our competitors.        We operate our business in two distinct segments:              o     the electronic components segment, which operates under the                   name Pulse, and              o     the electrical contact products segment, which operates under                   the name AMI Doduco.        General. We define net sales as gross sales less returns and allowances. We sometimes refer to net sales as revenue.        Prior to 2001, the growth in our consolidated net sales was due in large part to the growth of electronic component markets served by Pulse. However, beginning in late 2000, the electronics markets served by Pulse experienced a severe global contraction. In late 2002, many of these markets began to stabilize or increase in terms of unit sales. However, because of excess capacity, relocation by customers from North America and Europe to Asia, and emergence of strong competitors in Asia, the pricing environment for Pulse's products has been and remains challenging, preventing total revenue from growing proportionately with unit growth. Pulse has undertaken a series of cost-reduction actions to optimize its capacity with market conditions.        Since late 2000 and continuing through late 2003, the markets in both North America and Europe for AMI Doduco's products have been weak. The markets in both North America and Europe began to recover in 2004. Demand at AMI Doduco typically mirrors the prevailing economic conditions in North America and Europe. This is true for electrical contacts, and for component subassemblies for automotive applications such as multi-function switches, motor control sensors and ignition security systems, and for non-automotive uses such as appliance and industrial controls. AMI Doduco continues its cost reduction actions including work force adjustments and plant consolidations in line with demand around the world in order to optimize efficiency.        Historically, the gross margin at Pulse has been significantly higher than at AMI Doduco. As a result, the mix of net sales generated by Pulse and AMI Doduco during a period affects our consolidated gross margin. Our gross margin is also significantly affected by capacity utilization, particularly at AMI Doduco and the Pulse Consumer Division. Pulse's markets are characterized by relatively short product life cycles compared to AMI Doduco. As a result, significant product turnover occurs each year. Therefore, Pulse's changes in average selling prices do not necessarily provide a meaningful and quantifiable measure of Pulse's operations. AMI Doduco has a relatively long-term and mature product line, with less turnover, and with less frequent variation in the prices of product sold, relative to Pulse. Many of AMI Doduco's products are sold under annual (or longer) purchase contracts. Therefore, AMI Doduco's revenues historically have not been subject to significant price fluctuations. In                                          19   addition, sales growth and contraction at AMI Doduco and Pulse's Consumer Division are generally attributable to changes in unit volume and changes in unit pricing, as well as foreign exchange rates, especially the U.S. dollar to the euro.        Acquisitions. Historically, acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy. In many cases, our move into new product lines and extensions of our existing product lines or markets has been facilitated by an acquisition. Our acquisitions continually change the mix of our net sales. Pulse made numerous acquisitions in recent years which have increased our penetration into our primary markets and expanded our presence in new markets. Excelsus was acquired in August 2001 for approximately $85.9 million, net of cash acquired. Excelsus was based in Carlsbad, California, and was a leading producer of customer-premises digital subscriber line filters and other broadband accessories and it is now a core part of Pulse's telecommunications product division. Pulse acquired Eldor's consumer electronics business in January 2003 for approximately $83.9 million, and this became the Pulse Consumer Division headquartered in Italy with production operations in Istanbul and Izmir, Turkey and in the PRC. The Consumer Division is a leading supplier of flyback transformers to the European television industry. We acquired a controlling interest in Full Rise Electronic Co., Ltd. ("FRE") in 2004. FRE is based in the Republic of China (Taiwan) and manufacturers connector products, including single and multiple-port jacks, and supplies such products to Pulse under a cooperation agreement. AMI Doduco has also made acquisitions over the years. Generally, AMI Doduco's acquisitions have been driven by our strategy of expanding our product and geographical market presence for electrical contact products. Due to our integration of acquisitions and the interchangeable sources of net sales between existing and acquired operations, historically we have not separately tracked the net sales of an acquisition after the date of the transaction.        Technology. Our business is continually affected by changes in technology, design, and preferences of consumers and other end users of our products, as well as changes in regulatory requirements. We address these changes by continuing to invest in new product development and by maintaining a diverse product portfolio which contains both mature and emerging technologies in order to meet customer demands.        Management Focus. Our executives focus on a number of important factors in evaluating our financial condition and operational performance. We use economic profit, which we define as operating profit after tax, less our cost of capital. Revenue growth, gross profit as a percentage of revenue, and operating profit as a percent of revenue are also among these factors. Operating leverage or incremental operating profit as a percentage of incremental sales is a factor that is discussed frequently with analysts and investors, as this is believed to reflect the benefit of absorbing fixed overhead and operating expenses. In evaluating working capital management, liquidity and cash flow, our executives also use performance measures such as days sales outstanding, days payable outstanding and inventory turnover. The continued success of our business is largely dependent on meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations. Therefore, non-financial performance measures relating to on-time delivery and quality assist our management in monitoring customer satisfaction on an on-going basis.        Cost Reduction Programs. Our manufacturing business model for Pulse's non-consumer markets has a very high variable cost component due to the labor-intensity of many processes, which allows us to quickly change our capacity based on market demand. The Pulse Consumer Division, however, is capital intensive and therefore more sensitive to volume changes. AMI Doduco has a higher fixed cost component of manufacturing activity than Pulse, as it is more capital intensive. Therefore, AMI Doduco is unable to expand or contract its capacity as quickly as Pulse in response to market demand, although significant actions have been taken to align AMI Doduco's capacity with current market demand.        As a result of our continuing focus on both economic and operating profit, we will continue to aggressively size both Pulse and AMI Doduco so that costs are optimally matched to current and anticipated future revenue and unit demand. We will also continue to pursue additional growth opportunities. The amounts of additional charges will depend on specific actions taken. The actions taken over the past several years such as plant closures, plant relocations, asset impairments and reduction in personnel worldwide have resulted in the elimination of a variety of costs. The majority of these costs represent the annual salaries and benefits of terminated employees, both those directly related to manufacturing and those providing selling, general and administrative services, as well as lower overhead costs related to factory relocations to lower-cost locations. The eliminated costs also include depreciation savings from disposed equipment. We have implemented a succession of cost reduction initiatives and programs, summarized as follows:        During 2001, we announced the closure of our production facilities in Thailand and Malaysia. The production at these two facilities was transferred to other Pulse facilities in Asia. In addition, headcount was reduced by approximately 12,300, net of new hires, during fiscal 2001 through voluntary employee attrition and involuntary                                          20   workforce reductions primarily at manufacturing facilities in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"). In addition, a charge was recorded in 2001 to writedown the value of certain Pulse fixed assets to their disposal value.        During 2002, we announced the closure of our production facility in the Philippines. The production at this facility was transferred to other Pulse facilities in Asia. We also adopted other restructuring plans during 2002 for personnel reductions. An additional provision was recorded in 2002 related to asset writedowns, relating to primarily Asian-based production equipment that became idle in 2002.        During 2003, we accrued for the elimination of certain manufacturing and support positions located in France, the United Kingdom, Mexico, the PRC and for other facility exit costs related to Pulse. We accrued for the shutdown of Pulse's manufacturing facility in Mexico and to write down the carrying cost of Pulse's facility in the Philippines which is held for sale. At AMI Doduco, we accrued for the elimination of certain manufacturing positions principally located in North America and Germany and to complete the shutdown of a redundant facility in Spain that we acquired from Engelhard-CLAL in 2001.        During 2004, we accrued for the termination of personnel at AMI Doduco's facility in Germany; for Pulse's shutdown of a facility in Carlsbad, California; to reduce capacity at a Pulse facility in the PRC; to shutdown AMI Doduco's facility in France; and for other severance in various locations.        International Operations. As of December 31, 2004, we had manufacturing operations in 10 countries and had no significant net sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and the euro. A large percentage of our sales in recent years have been outside of the United States. In the year ended December 31, 2004, 78% of our net sales were outside of the U.S. Changing exchange rates often impact our financial results and our period-over-period comparisons. This is particularly true of movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. AMI Doduco's European and Pulse's Consumer Division sales are denominated primarily in euro, and euro-denominated sales and earnings may result in higher or lower dollar sales and net earnings upon translation for our U.S. consolidated financial statements. We may also experience a positive or negative translation adjustment to equity because our investment in Pulse's Consumer Division and AMI Doduco's European operations may be worth more or less in U.S. dollars after translation for our U. S. consolidated financial statements. The Pulse non-consumer operations may incur foreign currency gains or losses as euro-denominated transactions are remeasured to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. If a higher percentage of our sales is denominated in non-U.S. currencies, increased exposure to currency fluctuations may result.        In order to reduce our exposure resulting from currency fluctuations, we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts and/or currency options. These contracts guarantee a predetermined range of exchange rates at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. As of December 31, 2004, we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding to sell forward approximately 58.8 million euros in order to hedge intercompany loans. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts and currency options, we consider the amount of sales, purchases and net assets or liabilities denominated in local currencies, the type of currency, and the costs associated with the contracts.        Precious Metals. AMI Doduco uses silver, as well as other precious metals, in manufacturing some of its electrical contacts, contact materials and contact subassemblies. Historically, we have leased or held these materials through consignment arrangements with our suppliers except in the case of AMI Doduco's entity in the PRC which owns its precious metals. Leasing and consignment costs have typically been below the costs to borrow funds to purchase the metals, and more importantly, these arrangements eliminate the effects of fluctuations in the market price of owned precious metal and enable us to minimize our inventories. AMI Doduco's terms of sale generally allow us to charge customers for precious metal content based on market value of precious metal on the day after shipment to the customer. Thus far we have been successful in managing the costs associated with our precious metals. While limited amounts are purchased for use in production, the majority of our precious metal inventory continues to be leased or held on consignment. If our leasing/consignment fees increase significantly in a short period of time, and we are unable to recover these increased costs through higher sale prices, a negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity may result. Leasing/consignment fee increases are caused by increases in interest rates or volatility in the price of the consigned material.        Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in high-tax jurisdictions such as those in Europe and the income earned in low-tax jurisdictions, particularly Izmir, Turkey and the People's Republic of China. This mix of income can vary significantly from one period to another. We have benefited over recent years from favorable tax incentives, inside and outside of the U.S. However, there is no guarantee as to how long these benefits will continue to exist. Except in limited circumstances, we have not provided                                          21   for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on our non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings as per Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes - Special Areas. Such earnings include pre-acquisition earnings of foreign entities acquired through stock purchases, and are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $333.0 million of our non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings (as calculated for income tax purposes) as of December 31, 2004, as per APB 23. Unrecognized deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings are estimated to be approximately $96.0 million. Where excess cash has accumulated in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and it is advantageous for tax reasons, subsidiary earnings may be repatriated.  Results of Operations  Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 26, 2003        Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $73.1 million, or 14.3%, to $582.3 million from $509.2 million in the year ended December 26, 2003. Our sales increase from the comparable period last year was attributable to improvement in the markets for Pulse in the first half of the year, and for AMI Doduco throughout the year. Pulse's increase in net sales also reflects the inclusion of Full Rise Electronic Co., Ltd. ("FRE") net sales from the time we acquired a controlling interest in September 2004. Stronger demand in Pulse's networking, power conversion, military/aerospace and consumer division markets was particularly apparent in the first six months of the year. AMI Doduco's increase in net sales was primarily due to higher prices for precious metals and favorable translation effect of a stronger euro, as well as stronger economic growth and successes in AMI Doduco's efforts to increase its market share.        Pulse's net sales increased $26.1 million, or 8.9%, to $320.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $294.1 million in the year ended December 26, 2003. Pulse sales benefited from the inclusion of FRE's net sales from the time we acquired a controlling interest in September 2004. Pulse also experienced revenue increases in networking, telecommunications, power conversion, military/aerospace and consumer division markets on a worldwide basis. However, sales derived from the consumer division (which are denominated in euros) were lower in local currency in the 2004 period, although this was offset by the favorable translation effect of a stronger euro in 2004, after translating the consumer division's sales in to U.S. dollars.        AMI Doduco's net sales increased $47.0 million, or 21.8%, to $262.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $215.2 million in the year ended December 26, 2003. The sales benefited from an increase in the average euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate and higher prices for precious metals which were passed on to customers. The higher average euro-to-dollar exchange rate during 2004 versus the comparable period in 2003 had the effect of increasing reported sales by approximately $17.6 million. Sales in the 2004 period reflect improving demand in North America and Europe. The sales improvements were partially offset by price adjustments related to new long-term contracts with major customers.        Cost of Sales. As a result of higher net sales, our cost of sales increased $60.2 million, or 16.0%, to $436.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $375.9 million for the year ended December 26, 2003. Our consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 25.1%, compared with 26.2% in the year ended December 26, 2003. Our consolidated gross margin in 2004 was negatively affected by:     o  AMI Doduco accounting for a higher percentage of sales relative to Pulse,       in that AMI Doduco's products typically have a lower gross margin than       those of Pulse,     o  lower average selling prices for most Pulse product lines through 2004;       and     o  lower capacity utilization at Pulse in the second half of 2004.  These negative impacts on gross margin were partially offset by the higher capacity utilization at Pulse and AMI Doduco in the first half of 2004 versus the comparable period in 2003.        Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $10.6 million to $109.8 million from $99.2 million, for the year ended December 26, 2003. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses was 18.9% in the year ended December 31, 2004 versus 19.5% in the comparable period, or a decrease of 0.6%. Increased spending was a result of increased variable costs such as selling commissions and stock compensation expense due to a higher average share price in 2004, partially offset by restructuring actions that we took over the last year to reduce expenses and tighten spending controls. Selling expense and stock compensation expense, in particular, were $2.8 million and $1.1 million higher, respectively, in 2004 versus the comparable period in 2003. European expenses that are                                          22   denominated in euros were translated to a higher level of U.S. dollars at the higher euro-to-dollar exchange rate in 2004. Increased spending was also a result of the inclusion of FRE expenses in our consolidated results from the time we acquired a controlling interest in September 2004.        Research, development and engineering expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. For the year ended December 31, 2004 and December 26, 2003 respectively, RD&E by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):                                                   2004               2003                                                  ----               ----           Pulse                                $18,420            $14,439           Percentage of segment sales             5.8%               4.9%            AMI Doduco                             4,182             $4,030           Percentage of segment sales             1.6%               1.9%        Higher RD&E spending in 2004 at Pulse includes additional investments in our China Development Center, inclusion of FRE RD&E beginning in September 2004 and higher U.S. dollar reported spending of RD&E expenses incurred in euros. We believe that future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next-generation products. Design and development activities with our OEM customers continued at an aggressive pace during 2004 and into 2005.        Severance and Asset Impairment Expense. Total severance and asset impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $18.8 million, to $27.9 million from $9.0 million for the year ended December 26, 2003. The increase in the 2004 period is attributable to $18.5 million of intangible impairments related to Eldor and Excelsus acquired intangibles, and $0.4 million for other acquired intangibles. These intangible asset impairments resulted from updated cash flow projections relating to technology and customer relationships, and reflect, among other things, shifting product mixes, changes among major customers and continuing pressures on selling prices in the consumer and telecommunication product division of the Pulse segment.        In the year ended December 31, 2004, we accrued $9.0 million for severance and related payments comprised of $3.1 million related to AMI Doduco's termination of manufacturing and personnel at a facility in Germany, $2.7 million related to the termination of manufacturing and support personnel at an AMI Doduco facility in France, $1.5 million to write-down the value of certain Pulse fixed assets to their disposal values, $0.8 million related to Pulse's shutdown of a facility in Carlsbad, California and $0.9 million for other severances in various locations. The vast majority of these accruals will be utilized by the end of the second quarter in 2005.        In the year ended December 26, 2003, we accrued $9.0 million in the aggregate for severance and related payments and asset impairments. At Pulse, we accrued $1.5 million for the elimination of certain manufacturing and support positions located in France, the United Kingdom, Mexico and the PRC and $0.7 million for other facility exit costs. We additionally accrued $1.9 million for shutdown of Pulse's manufacturing facility in Mexico and $0.5 million to write-down the carrying cost of Pulse's facility in the Philippines which is held for sale. At AMI Doduco, we accrued $2.9 million for the elimination of certain manufacturing positions principally located in North America and Germany and $1.5 million to complete the shutdown of a redundant facility in Spain that we acquired from Engelhard-CLAL in 2001. The majority of these accruals were utilized by the end of 2004.        Interest. Net interest expense was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to net interest expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 26, 2003. The average higher balance of invested cash in 2004 over the comparable period in 2003, at a similar interest income yield, resulted in slightly lower net interest expense. Recurring aggregate components of interest expense, such as silver leasing fees, interest on bank debt and bank commitment fees, approximated those of 2003.        Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $2.0 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2004 versus $0.6 million of expense for the year ended December 26, 2003. The change is attributable to a gain of $1.1 million related to the settlement of equity rights arising from the 2001 acquisition of the Engelhard-CLAL electrical contacts business for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $1.4 million more in foreign exchange losses during the year ended December 26, 2003 compared to 2004.        Equity Earnings in Minority-Owned Investments. Equity earnings in minority-owned investments were $0.8 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2004 versus an $8.7 million loss for the year ended December 26, 2003. The net loss in 2003 included a $9.3 million charge to the original cost basis of our investment, offset by $0.6                                          23   million of equity method investment earnings in 2003. Since we acquired control of FRE in September 2004, we consolidate FRE's results, and we no longer record equity earnings from FRE. Rather, the full consolidation of FRE and related minority interest expense is now reflected in our financial statements.        Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 31% compared to 20% for the year ended December 26, 2003. The higher tax rate in 2004 resulted from a higher proportion of income being attributable to high-tax jurisdictions, the impact of non-deductible restructuring expenses in high-tax jurisdictions and the tax effects of intangible asset impairments.        Minority Interest. Minority interest was $0.7 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2004. Since the date we acquired control of FRE on September 13, 2004, we began consolidating FRE's results with our own. The net earnings attributable to the minority interest are reflected as minority interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2004.        Year ended December 26, 2003 compared to the year ended December 27, 2002        Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended December 26, 2003 increased $102.8 million, or 25.3%, to $509.2 million from $406.4 million in the year ended December 27, 2002. Our sales increase from the comparable period last year was primarily attributable to the increases from the Eldor acquisition and stronger sales of Pulse's legacy products, tempered by ongoing pressure on selling prices at Pulse, and to a lesser extent, weaker demand at AMI Doduco, which resulted in lower sales of electrical contacts and contact materials on a constant-euro basis.        Pulse's net sales increased $89.5 million, or 43.7%, to $294.1 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 from $204.6 million in the year ended December 27, 2002. Most of the increase is attributable to sales of Eldor since the date of acquisition in January 2003. Increased unit revenues in many Pulse legacy product lines were somewhat offset by our average selling price declines.        AMI Doduco's net sales increased $13.4 million, or 6.6%, to $215.2 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 from $201.8 million in the year ended December 27, 2002. Sales in the 2003 period reflect weak North American and European markets, which were more than offset by the positive translation effect of an increase in the average euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate during the period. Lower net sales in local currencies, primarily euros, resulted from lower manufacturing activity by customers in the commercial and industrial machinery and non-residential construction end markets.        Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales increased $66.1 million, or 21.3%, to $375.9 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 from $309.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2002, which did not include Pulse's Consumer Division. Our consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 26, 2003 was 26.2% compared to 23.8% for the year ended December 27, 2002. Our consolidated gross margin was positively affected by:     o  a mix of net sales weighted more toward Pulse, whose products typically       have a higher gross margin than those of AMI Doduco,     o  the addition of the Pulse Consumer Division products, which typically have       a higher gross margin than AMI Doduco products and some Pulse legacy       products, and     o  better capacity utilization and lower per-unit overhead costs at Pulse in       2003 than in 2002.        These positive impacts on gross margin in 2003 were partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies at AMI Doduco due to under-utilization of capacity and continued consolidation activities among European, Asian and North American manufacturing facilities.        Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 26, 2003 increased $9.9 million, or 11.1%, to $99.2 million or 19.5% of net sales, from $89.3 million or 22.0% of net sales, for the year ended December 27, 2002. The increase in the 2003 period compared to the 2002 period is primarily attributable to an increase of $4.2 million in incentive and stock compensation expense reflecting higher levels of profitability, and $2.4 million of intangible asset amortization related to the Eldor acquisition. The addition of Eldor expenses and the higher translated U.S. dollar cost of euro-denominated expenses were partially offset by savings achieved from restructuring actions that we took over the past year to reduce costs and tighten spending.                                          24         Research, development and engineering expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. For the year ended December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002 respectively, RD&E by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):                                                   2003               2002                                                  ----               ----           Pulse                                $14,439            $13,892           Percentage of segment sales             4.9%               6.8%            AMI Doduco                            $4,030             $3,903           Percentage of segment sales             1.9%               1.9%        Although some consolidation of RD&E, particularly design activity, has occurred through restructuring and relocation activities at Pulse, we have minimized spending cuts in the RD&E area as we believe that future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next-generation products. Design and development activities with our OEM customers continued at an aggressive pace during 2003. The change in RD&E as a percentage of sales at Pulse relates to the effect of the acquisition of Eldor, as Eldor incurs lower RD&E costs relative to its sales as compared to Pulse legacy products.        Severance and Asset Impairment Expense. During 2003, we accrued $9.0 million in the aggregate for severance and related payments and asset impairments. At Pulse, we accrued $1.5 million for the elimination of certain manufacturing and support positions located in France, the United Kingdom, Mexico and China and $0.7 million for other facility exit costs. We additionally accrued $1.9 million for shutdown of Pulse's manufacturing facility in Mexico and $0.5 million to write-down carrying cost of Pulse's facility in the Philippines which is held for sale. At AMI Doduco, we accrued $2.9 million for the elimination of certain manufacturing positions principally located in North America and Germany and $1.5 million to complete the shutdown of a redundant facility in Spain that we acquired from Engelhard-CLAL in 2001. The majority of these accruals were utilized by the end of 2004.        During 2002, we announced the closure of our production facility in the Philippines. The production at this facility was transferred to other Pulse facilities in Asia. We recorded charges of $3.8 million for this plant closing, comprising $1.4 million for severance and related payments and $2.4 million for asset writedowns. The majority of this accrual was utilized by the end of 2002. We also adopted other restructuring plans during 2002. In this regard, we recorded provisions of $5.9 million for personnel reductions, and substantially all of the employee severance and related payments in connection with these actions were completed as of December 31, 2004. An additional provision of $7.0 million was recorded in 2002 related to asset writedowns. These assets were primarily Asian-based production equipment which became idle in 2002. During 2002, we also recorded an impairment charge of $32.1 million of the value assigned to the Excelsus tradename, before a $12.8 million tax benefit.        Interest. Net interest expense was $0.8 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 compared to net interest expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 27, 2002. The increase in net interest expense in the current period is due to lower yields on a lower average cash invested balance, which more than offset higher average outstanding bank debt and related interest expense in the prior year period. Bank debt in 2002 consisted of euro-denominated term loans which were paid off in July 2002, and credit facility debt from the Excelsus acquisition which was paid off in April 2002. Net interest expense also includes interest on our precious metal leases and commitment fees on our unused credit facility.        Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 26, 2003 was 20.0% compared to 30.8% in the form of a benefit for the year ended December 27, 2002. While the prior year's rate reflects a tax benefit recorded in connection with the trade name impairment write-off, the tax rate in 2003 resulted from a higher portion of income being attributable to low-tax jurisdictions, combined with restructuring expenses of AMI Doduco which yielded tax benefits in high-tax jurisdictions.        Equity method investment loss. We acquired 19.5% of Full Rise Electronic Co., Ltd. ("FRE") in 2001, and an additional 10% in 2002. Shares of FRE began trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in January of 2003, and they have experienced considerable price volatility. We recorded a net loss on equity method investments of $8.7 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 compared to equity method investments earnings of $0.3 million for the year ended December 27, 2002. The net loss in 2003 resulted from a $9.3 million charge to the original cost basis of our investment, offset by $0.6 million of equity method investment earnings in 2003. As of December 26, 2003, we maintained an option to acquire a controlling interest in FRE at its market value at the time of exercise which we did exercise in fiscal 2004. See additional information in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                          25   Liquidity and Capital Resources        Working capital as of December 31, 2004 was $238.9 million, compared to $199.8 million as of December 26, 2003. This increase of $39.1 million was primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, and inventories which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and short-term debt. The inclusion of FRE in our consolidated balance sheet accounted for $12.2 million of the increase in working capital. Cash and cash equivalents, which are included in working capital, increased from $143.4 million as of December 26, 2003 to $156.0 million as of December 31, 2004.        Net cash provided by operating activities was $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $55.2 million in the comparable period of 2003, a decrease of $21.9 million. This decrease was attributable to working capital increases attributable to higher inventory, lower accounts payable and lower accrued expenses.        We present our statement of cash flows using the indirect method as permitted under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Our management has found that investors and analysts typically refer to changes in accounts receivable, inventory, and other components of working capital when analyzing operating cash flows. Also, changes in working capital are more directly related to the way we manage our business for cash flow than are items such as cash receipts from the sale of goods, as would appear using the direct method.        Capital expenditures were $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 and $7.8 million in the comparable period of 2003. The increase of $3.2 million in the 2004 period compared to 2003 was due primarily to higher expenditures at the Pulse Consumer Division and FRE. We make capital expenditures to expand production capacity and to improve our operating efficiency. We plan to continue making such expenditures in the future as and when necessary.        We used $5.1 million for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2004, which is net of $11.7 million of cash held by FRE that was included in our consolidated financial statements as of September 13, 2004. The current year expenditures related to the acquisition by Pulse of a plastics fabrication operation in the People's Republic of China for $3.6 million and an additional equity investment in FRE for $13.2 million. We used $83.9 million cash for acquisitions in the comparable period of 2003, primarily for the purchase of Eldor's consumer electronics division in January 2003. We may acquire other businesses or product lines to expand our breadth and scope of operations.        We did not declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in fiscal 2004 or 2003. On February 2, 2005 we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0875 per common share, payable on April 22, 2005 to shareholders of record on April 8, 2005. This quarterly dividend is expected to result in a cash payment to shareholders of approximately $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2005. Annualized, the amount of the dividend represents a yield of approximately 2% of the price of one common share at the close of trading on February 1, 2005.        We entered into a new credit agreement on June 17, 2004 providing for $125.0 million of credit capacity. The facility consists of an aggregate U.S. dollar-equivalent revolving line of credit in the principal amount of up to $125.0 million, which provides for borrowings in multiple currencies including but not limited to U.S. dollars and euros, including individual sub-limits of:        -     a U.S. dollar-based swing-line loan not to exceed $10.0 million; and        -     a multicurrency facility providing for the issuance of letters of             credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed the U.S. dollar             equivalent of $15.0 million.        The credit agreement permits us to request one or more increases in the total commitment not to exceed $75.0 million, provided the minimum increase is $25.0 million, subject to bank approval.        The total amount outstanding under the credit facility may not exceed $125.0 million, provided we do not request an increase in total commitment as noted above. In any event, outstanding borrowings are limited to a maximum of three times our earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined by the credit agreement, on a rolling twelve-month basis as of the most recent quarter-end.        The credit facility contains covenants specifying a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio, minimum interest expense coverage, capital expenditure limitations, and other customary and normal provisions. We are in compliance with all such covenants. As of December 31, 2004, we have no outstanding borrowings under our existing three-year revolving credit agreement.                                          26         We pay a commitment fee on the unborrowed portion of the commitment, which ranges from 0.175% to 0.300% of the total commitment, depending on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined above. The interest rate for each currency's borrowing will be a combination of the base rate for that currency plus a credit margin spread. The base rate is different for each currency. The credit margin spread is the same for each currency and is 0.750% to 1.500%, depending on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined above. Each of our domestic subsidiaries with net worth equal to or greater than $5 million guarantees all obligations incurred under the credit facility.        We also have an obligation outstanding due in August 2009 under an unsecured term loan agreement in Germany for the borrowing of approximately 5.1 million euros.        At December 31, 2004, we included $6.7 million of outstanding debt of Full Rise Electronic Co., Ltd. in connection with our consolidation of FRE's financial statements. FRE has a total credit limit of approximately $15.5 million in U.S. dollar equivalents as of December 31, 2004. Neither Technitrol, nor any of its subsidiaries, has guaranteed or otherwise participated in the credit facilities of FRE.        We had three standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004 in the aggregate amount of $1.5 million securing transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business.        We had commercial commitments outstanding at December 31, 2004 of approximately $83.4 million due under precious metal consignment-type leases. This represents an increase of $22.8 million from the $60.6 million outstanding as of December 26, 2003 and is attributable to volume increases and higher average silver prices during 2004.        As of December 31, 2004, future payments related to contractual obligations were as follows (in thousands):                                                 Amounts due by period                           Total  Less than 1 year  1 to 3 years   3 to 5 years    Thereafter                           -----  ----------------  ------------   ------------    ----------            Debt                    $13,972           $ 6,847        $  188        $ 6,937        $    0 Operating leases         26,285             7,613         8,142          3,865         6,665                         -------           -------        ------        -------        ------ Total                   $40,257           $14,460        $8,330        $10,802        $6,665   We believe that the combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future. In addition, we may use internally generated funds or obtain borrowings or additional equity offerings for acquisitions of suitable businesses or assets.        All retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions as of December 31, 2004, with the exception of approximately $14.0 million of retained earnings primarily in the PRC, that are restricted in accordance with Section 58 of the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprises Law. Included in the $14.0 million is $1.8 million of retained earnings of FRE of which we own 51%. The amount restricted in accordance with the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprise Law is applicable to all foreign investment enterprises doing business in the PRC. The restriction applies to 10% of our net earnings in the PRC, limited to 50% of the total capital invested in the PRC. We have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and none are foreseen. However, foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash movements from time to time. The retained earnings in other countries represent a material portion of our assets. We expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years will be abroad. If these earnings were brought back to the United States, significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the United States as several countries in which we operate have tax rates significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Additionally, we have not accrued U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on foreign earnings that have been indefinitely invested abroad.        On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act ("AJCA") was signed into law. The AJCA introduced a limited-time 85% dividends-received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. This deduction would result in a federal tax rate of approximately 5.25% on the repatriated earnings. To qualify for the deduction, the earnings must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company's chief executive officer and approved by the company's board of directors. Additionally, certain other criteria, as outlined in the AJCA, must also be met. We may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal 2005. We have begun an evaluation of the possible effects of the repatriation provision. For                                          27   our business, however, we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after the U.S. Congress or the Treasury Department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. In January 2005, the Treasury Department began to issue the first of a series of clarifying guidance documents related to this provision. We expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifications. The amount that we are considering for repatriation under this provision ranges from zero to approximately $125.0 million. While we estimate that the related potential range of additional income tax is between zero and $10.1 million, this estimation is subject to change following technical correction legislation that we believe is forthcoming from the U. S. Congress. The amount of additional income tax expense would be reduced by the part of the eligible dividend that is attributable to foreign earnings on which a deferred tax liability had been previously accrued.  New Accounting Pronouncements        In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123(R) requires compensation expense to be recognized for all share-based payments made to employees based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, eliminating the intrinsic value alternative allowed by SFAS No. 123. Generally, the approach to determining fair value under the original pronouncement has not changed, however, there are revisions to the accounting guidelines established, such as accounting for forfeitures. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue, operating results, financial position or liquidity.        In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-2 ("FAS 109-2"), Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004. As noted above, the AJCA introduces a limited time 85% dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation provision), provided certain criteria are met. FAS 109-2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. Although FAS 109-2 is effective immediately, we do not expect to be able to complete our evaluation of the repatriation provision until after Congress or the Treasury Department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision.        In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151, Inventory Costs or Amendment of ARB No.43, Chapter 4 ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151 provides for certain fixed production overhead cost to be reflected as a period cost and not capitalized as inventory. SFAS 151 is effective for the beginning of our fiscal 2006. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue, operating results, financial position or liquidity.  Item 7a Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk        Our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt, are exposed to changes in interest rates in both the U.S. and abroad. We invest our excess cash in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities. We generally limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extent practical. Our board has adopted policies relating to these risks and continually monitors compliance with these policies.        Our existing credit facility has variable interest rates. Accordingly, interest expense may increase if we borrow and if the rates associated with our borrowings move higher. In addition, we may pursue additional or alternative financing for growth opportunities in one or both segments. We may use interest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates. However, we have not used any of these instruments to date.        The table below presents principal amounts in U.S. dollars (or equivalent U.S. dollars with respect to non-U.S. denominated debt) and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our foreign debt obligations. The column captioned "Approximate Fair Value" sets forth the carrying value of our long-term debt as of December 31, 2004, which approximates our fair value at such date after taking into consideration current rates offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. We do not hold or issue financial instruments or derivative financial instruments for trading purposes (dollars in thousands):                                          28                                                                                                                   Approx.

However, we conduct business in various foreign currencies, including those of emerging market countries in Asia as well as European countries. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily forward exchange contracts in connection with fair value hedges, to manage foreign currency risks. In accordance with SFAS 133, gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognized in income along with adjustments of carrying amounts of the hedged items. Therefore, all of our forward exchange contracts are marked-to-market, and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income. These contracts guarantee a predetermined rate of exchange at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. We believe there are two potential risks of holding these instruments. The first is that the foreign currency being hedged could move in a direction which could create a better economic outcome than if hedging had not taken place. The second risk is that the counterparty to a currency hedge defaults on its obligations. We reduce the risk of counterparty default by entering into relatively short-term hedges with well capitalized and highly rated banks. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts, we consider the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies, the type of currency and the costs associated with the contracts. As of December 31, 2004, we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding to sell forward 58.8 million euro in order to hedge intercompany loans. The term of this contract was 30 days.        The table below provides information about our other non-derivative, non-U.S. dollar denominated financial instruments and presents the information in equivalent U.S. dollars. Amounts set forth under "Liabilities" represent principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our foreign currency debt obligations. The column captioned "Approximate Fair Value" sets forth the carrying value of our foreign currency long-term debt as of December 31, 2004, which approximates our fair value at such date after taking into consideration current rates offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities (dollars in thousands):                                          29                                                                                                              Approx.
