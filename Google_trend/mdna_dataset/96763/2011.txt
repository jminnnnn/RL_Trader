Item 7     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Introduction    This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as well as other sections of this report contain certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in the “Risk Factors” section of this report on pages 8 through 15.    Overview    We are  a global producer of precision-engineered electronic components and modules.  Based on our estimates of the total annual revenues in our primary markets and our share of those markets relative to our competitors, we believe we are a leading global producer of electronic components and modules in the primary markets we serve.    We operate our business in three segments:              ·    our Network product group which we refer to as Network,               ·    our Power product group which we refer to as Power, and               ·    our Wireless product group which we refer to as Wireless.       Network produces a variety of passive components that manage and regulate electronic signals for use in a variety of devices used in local area and wide area networks, such as connectors, filters, filtered connectors, transformers, splitters, micro-filters, baluns and chokes.  Power primarily manufactures products that adjust and ensure proper current and voltage, limit distortion of voltage, sense and report current and voltage and cause mechanical movement or actuation, which includes power transformers, chokes, current and voltage sensors, ignition coils, automotive coils, military and aerospace products and other power magnetic products.  Wireless manufactures products that capture or transmit wireless communication signals, such as antennas, antenna modules and antenna mounting components.    Net sales for our three segments for the years ended December 31, 2010, December 25, 2009 and December 26, 2008 were as follows ( in millions ):                2010          2009          2008        Network      $  219.2        $  152.7        $  216.0       Power         127.0           95.1           147.0       Wireless         86.3           151.0           263.3       Net sales      $  432.5        $  398.8        $  626.3         General .  We define net sales as gross sales less returns and allowances. We sometimes refer to net sales as revenue.    Historically, our gross margin has been significantly affected by product mix, capacity utilization, divestitures and acquisitions.  The markets served by each of our segments are characterized by relatively short product life cycles, which causes significant product turnover each year and, subsequently, frequent variations in the prices of products sold.  Due to the constantly changing quantity of parts each segment offers and the frequent changes in our average selling prices, we cannot isolate the impact of changes in unit volume and unit prices on our net sales or gross margin in any given period.  In addition, our operations are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates, especially the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro and the Chinese renminbi, which affect our U.S. dollar reported net sales and results of operations.    We believe our focus on technology and other strategic investments, both internal and external, provides us opportunities for future growth in net sales and operating profit in all our segments.  However, unfavorable economic and market conditions, as well as customer preference, may result in a reduction in the demand for our products, thus negatively impacting our financial performance.  Also, we may divest portions of our business, close certain locations or complete other cost reduction programs to permit our management to focus on our core businesses and to improve our overall long-term financial performance.             20            Technology and Strategic Investments .  Our products evolve along with changes in technology, changes in the availability and price of raw materials and changes in design preferences of the end users of our products.  Also, regulatory requirements can occasionally impact the design and functionality of our products.  We address these dynamic conditions, as well as our customers’ demands, by continually investing in the development of each of our segments products and by maintaining a diverse product portfolio which contains both mature and emerging technologies.  We remain committed to technological development through investing in research, development and engineering activities focused on designing next-generation products, improving our existing products and improving our manufacturing processes.  If we determine that any of our segments’ manufacturing processes would benefit from capital investment, we may allocate resources to fund the expansion of property, plant and equipment used in these processes.  For example, in 2010 we committed capital to advanced three dimensional antenna equipment which are used to produce the next-generation of our Wireless products.  Also, we have begun committing capital to automate certain manual manufacturing processes for our Network and Wireless products in order to avoid increasing direct labor costs.  In the future, similar investments in property, plant and equipment or research, development and engineering may be funded through internally generated cash flows or through other external resources.    Cost Reduction Programs .  We continue to simplify our operations to optimally match our capacity to the current and anticipated revenues and unit demand of each of our operating segments.  Specific actions to simplify our operations will dictate the future expenses associated with our cost reduction programs.  Actions taken over the past several years, such as divestitures, plant closures, plant relocations, asset impairments and reduction in personnel, have resulted in the elimination of a variety of costs.  The majority of these costs, not related to impairment of long-lived assets, represent the annual salaries and benefits of terminated employees, including both those related to manufacturing and those that provided selling, general and administrative services. Also, we have experienced depreciation savings from disposed equipment and reductions in rental expense from the termination of lease agreements.  Historically, we have also reduced labor and overhead costs as a result of relocating factories to lower-cost locations, specifically China.  The savings created by these cost reduction programs impact cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses, but the timing of such savings may not be apparent due to other performance factors such as unanticipated changes in demand, changes in unit selling prices, operational challenges and changes in operating strategies.    During the year ended December 31, 2010, we determined that approximately $29.7 million of our wireless reporting unit’s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were impaired, including $3.6 million of technology related to our audio products.  Also, we recorded an impairment of $0.3 million to one of our indefinite-lived tradenames.  Refer to Note 4,  Goodwill and other intangible assets , to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.  Additionally, we incurred a charge of $2.7 million for a number of cost reduction actions.  These charges include severance and related payments of $1.9 million and fixed asset impairments of $0.8 million.  The impaired assets were identified in 2010 and primarily include machinery and equipment that were unable to be cost-efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes.    During the year ended December 25, 2009, we determined that approximately $71.0 million of our wireless reporting unit’s goodwill was impaired.  Additionally, we incurred a charge of $11.9 million for a number of cost reduction actions.  These charges include severance and related payments of $3.0 million and fixed asset impairments of $8.9 million.  The impaired assets were identified in 2009 and include production lines associated with products that have no expected future demand and two real estate properties which were disposed.    During the year ended December 26, 2008, we determined that $310.4 million of goodwill and other intangibles were impaired, including $170.3 million of goodwill and identifiable intangibles of a discontinued operation.  Additionally, we incurred a charge of $9.6 million for a number of cost reduction actions.  These charges include severance and related payments and other associated costs of $5.5 million resulting from the termination of manufacturing and support personnel at our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and North America and $4.1 million of other costs primarily resulting from the transfer of manufacturing operations from Europe and North Africa to Asia.  Additionally, we recorded fixed asset impairments of $3.6 million.  The impaired assets were identified in 2008 and primarily include machinery and equipment that were unable to be cost-efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes.    Divestitures.  We engage in divestitures to streamline our operations, to focus on our core businesses, to reduce our external debt and to strengthen our financial position.  For example, we expect to divest the audio business of our Wireless segment for an amount immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements during the first quarter of 2011.   On September 2, 2010, we divested the European and Asian businesses of our former Electrical contact products segment (“Electrical”) for net proceeds of approximately $52.0 million, subject to normal working capital and other financial adjustments.  On January 4, 2010, we completed the sale of Electrical’s North American business for an amount immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  I n June 2009, we divested our Medtech components business for approximately $199.3 million, which reflects  final working capital and other financial adjustments.   In April 2009, we divested our MEMS business for an amount immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements .   We have had no material involvement with any of our divested operations after each respective sale.             21            Management Focus .  Our executives focus on a number of metrics to evaluate our consolidated financial condition and operating performance.  For example, we use consolidated revenue growth, gross margin, operating margin and return on research, development and engineering as performance measures.  Operating leverage, or incremental operating profit as a percentage of incremental sales, is also reviewed, which reflects the benefit of absorbing fixed overhead and operating expenses.  In evaluating consolidated working capital, liquidity and cash flow, our executives also use performance measures such as days sales outstanding, days payables outstanding, inventory turnover, debt-to-EBITDA leverage, cash conversion efficiency and free cash flow.  We define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital spending.  Additionally, as the continued success of our business is largely dependent on meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations, non-financial performance measures relating to product development, product quality and on-time delivery assists in monitoring customer satisfaction on an on-going basis.    International Operations . At December 31, 2010, we had manufacturing operations in the United States of America and China.  However, nearly all of our products are manufactured in China and sold to customers in China and other foreign countries.  Our net sales are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, euros and Chinese renminbi.  Changing exchange rates often impact our financial results and our period-over-period comparisons.  This is particularly true of movements in the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate with the Chinese renminbi and the euro, and each of these and other foreign currencies relative to each other.  Sales and net earnings denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar may result in higher or lower net sales and net earnings upon translation for our U.S. dollar denominated Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, sales in certain divisions of our Power and Wireless segments are denominated primarily in renminbi and euro.  Also, net earnings may be affected by the mix of sales and expenses by currency within each of our product groups. Foreign currency gains or losses may be incurred when non-functional currency denominated transactions are remeasured to an operation’s functional currency for financial reporting purposes. An increase in the percentage of our transactions denominated in non-U.S. currencies may result in increased foreign exchange exposure on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For example, we have experienced approximately $3.9 million in net foreign exchange losses during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to intercompany transactions denominated in varying currencies.  In addition, we may also experience a positive or negative translation adjustment to equity because our investments in non-U.S. dollar-functional subsidiaries may translate to more or less U.S. dollars in our U.S. Consolidated Financial Statements.    In order to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations, we may purchase foreign exchange forward contracts and/or currency options.  These contracts guarantee a predetermined exchange rate or range of rates at the time the contract is purchased.  This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuation from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee.  In determining the use of forward exchange contracts and currency options, we consider the amount of sales, purchases and net assets or liabilities denominated in local currencies, the currency to be hedged and the costs associated with the contracts.  At December 31, 2010, we had six foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately 5.5 million euro, or approximately $7.4 million, to receive Chinese renminbi.  The fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of $0.5 million as determined through use of Level 2 fair value inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy of Topic 815 in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”).  These contracts are used to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations at our Chinese operations.  At December 25, 2009, we had seven foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately 7.0 million euro, or approximately $10.1 million, to receive Chinese renminbi.   The fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of $0.2 million as determined through use of Level 2 fair value inputs.    Income Taxes . Our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in higher tax jurisdictions, such as those in Europe and the United States, and income earned in lower tax jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong and China.  This mix of income can vary significantly from one period to another.  Additionally, our effective income tax rate will be impacted from period to period by significant transactions and the deductibility of certain financing costs, severance and impairment costs and other similar costs. Changes in operations, tax legislation, estimates, judgments and forecasts may also affect our tax rate from period to period.  We have benefited over the years from favorable tax incentives and other tax policies.  However, there is no guarantee as to how long these benefits will continue to exist, which could materially impact our Consolidated Financials Statements.    Except in limited circumstances, we have not provided for U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on our non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings. Such earnings may include our pre-acquisition earnings of foreign entities acquired through stock purchases, which, with the exception of approximately $8.5 million, are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely.             22           Critical Accounting Policies    The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.  Note 1,  Summary of significant accounting policies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 46 through 50 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  These critical accounting policies are subject to review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for inventory, divestitures, acquisitions, goodwill and identifiable intangibles, income taxes, defined benefit plans, contingency accruals and severance and asset impairments.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:    Inventory Valuation.  We carry our inventories at lower of cost or market.  Inventory provisions are created to write down excess and obsolete inventory to market value.  We utilize historical trends and customer forecasts to estimate the expected usage of our inventory that is on-hand.  The establishment of inventory provisions requires judgments and estimates which may change over time and may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates.  However, we do not believe that a reasonable change in these assumptions would result in a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition, inventory purchases are based upon estimates of future demand that are based upon customer forecasts and the trend of product sales over recent historical periods.  If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements, than we may be required to write down our inventory which would cause a negative impact to gross margin.  However, if we were subsequently able to sell or use a significant portion of inventory that was previously written down, our gross margin could be positively affected.    Divestiture Accounting .   We engage in divestitures to streamline our operations, to focus on our core businesses, to reduce our external debt and to strengthen our financial position.   When the operations and cash flows of the divestiture have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations and, also, when we do not expect to have any significant continuing involvement with such operations,  w e may report the component that has either been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, as a discontinued operation.  If we plan to dispose of the component by sale, we are required to report the divested component at the lower of its carrying amount or at its fair value less costs to sell in the period it is classified as held for sale.  These assessments require judgments and estimates which include determining when it is appropriate to classify the component as held for sale, if the component meets the specifications of a discontinued operation, determining the fair value of the component and determining the level and type of involvement, if any, we will have with the disposed component in the future.   Furthermore, when removing the divested component from our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and, if necessary, restating results in prior periods, we are required to make assumptions, judgments and estimates regarding, among other things, the assets, liabilities and activities of the component and their relation to our continuing businesses.    Purchase Accounting .  The purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill.  Such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates which may change over time and may cause the final amounts to differ materially from their original estimates.  These adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period which cannot exceed twelve months.    Goodwill and Identifiable Intangibles .  We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the use of any asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, changes in projected operating performance, declines in stock price, failure to pass step one of our annual goodwill impairment test and significant negative economic trends.    Prior to 2010, we had goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets subject to an annual impairment review.  The annual review of our goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible assets is performed in our fourth fiscal quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of a potential impairment exist, to determine if the carrying amount of these intangible assets are impaired.    The impairment review process compares the fair value of each reporting unit, where goodwill resides, with its carrying value.  If the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform the second step of the impairment test that requires an allocation of the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill.  An impairment charge is recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill is less than its carrying amount.  We have identified three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes, which are our legacy Electronics unit, including our Power and Network segments but excluding a component of our connector product line known as FRE, our wireless reporting unit and FRE.             23            Our impairment review incorporates both an income and comparable-companies market approach to estimate potential impairment.  We believe the use of multiple valuation techniques results in a more accurate indicator of the fair value of each reporting unit, rather than the use of only an income approach.    The income approach is based on estimating future cash flows using various growth assumptions and discounting based on a present value factor.  We develop the future net cash flows during our annual budget process, which is completed in our fourth fiscal quarter of each year.  However, estimates of future cash flows are updated in conjunction with any goodwill recoverability analysis that is performed independent of our annual review.  The growth rates we use are an estimate of the future growth in the industries in which we participate and are adjusted, if necessary, for issues specific to our business and our position in the industry.  Our discount rate assumption is based on an estimated cost of capital, which we determine annually based on market participant estimated costs of debt and equity relative to our capital structure.  The comparable-companies market approach considers the trading multiples of our peer companies to compute our estimated fair value.  The majority of the comparable-companies utilized in our evaluation are included in the Dow Jones U.S. Electrical Components and Equipment Industry Group Index.    As a result of an unexpected decline in the actual and forecasted sales and operating profit of our wireless reporting unit, we performed step one of the goodwill impairment test in the first quarter of 2010.  Our wireless reporting unit did not pass the first step of the impairment test.  The second step of the goodwill impairment test resulted in a $14.6 million impairment to Wireless’ goodwill.  The assumptions used in the impairment test performed at March 26, 2010 were consistent with those used in our 2009 annual impairment review, except for the impact of a new outlook on business related to a major customer of our wireless reporting unit and the overall decline in the forecasted operating results for our wireless reporting unit. In addition to the 2010 impairment, we performed step one of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of 2009 as a result of the decline in our stock price and decrease in our forecasted operating profit, which our wireless reporting unit failed.  The second step of the impairment test yielded a $71.0 million goodwill impairment at our wireless reporting unit.  Refer to Note 4,  Goodwill and other intangible assets , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.    The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to the individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the selection of the appropriate discount rate, terminal growth rates, forecasted net cash flows, appropriate peer group companies and control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we participate. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in these assumptions, actual findings could differ from those estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning projected financial results or any of the other underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.  Additionally, significant changes in any of these estimates or assumptions in the future may result in a future impairment.  Changes in key assumptions would affect the goodwill impairments recognized in 2010 and 2009 as follows ( in millions, except assumption percentages ):          2010 Impairment                Increase 100          Decrease 100               Assumption           Basis Points            Basis Points         Discount rate         14.%        $  0.8        $  (0.9  )    Terminal growth rate         3.0%        $  (0.6  )     $  0.5       Control premium         25.0%        $  (0.1  )     $  0.1                2009 Impairment                Increase 100          Decrease 100               Assumption           Basis Points            Basis Points         Discount rate         22.5%        $  2.9        $  (3.0  )    Terminal growth rate         3.0%        $  (1.7  )     $  1.8       Control premium         25.0%        $  (0.4  )     $  0.5           As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Therefore, our annual review of goodwill was no longer required to be performed in the fourth quarter of 2010.    As part of our annual review of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we tested the carrying value of our tradenames, which resulted in approximately $0.3 million of impairment to one of our tradenames recorded during the fourth quarter of 2010.  In the second quarter of 2010, we decided to further simplify our operations by considering alternatives to withdraw from the audio market.   As a result, we performed a recoverability test on the finite-lived intangible assets related to our audio products, which resulted in a $3.6 million impairment to our technology intangibles.  As a result of a significant decline in Wireless’ actual and forecasted sales and operating profit during the first quarter of 2010, we performed a recoverability test on a finite-lived customer relationship intangible asset which resulted in an $11.5 million impairment charge.  Also, due to the adverse changes in our forecasted operating profit that led to the goodwill impairment realized in the first quarter of 2009, we performed a recoverability test on certain definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets that yielded no impairment.  Refer to Note 4,  Goodwill and other intangible assets , of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.             24            Assigning useful lives and periodically reassessing the useful lives of intangible assets is predicated on various assumptions.  Also, the fair values of our intangible assets are impacted by factors such as changes in technology, declines in demand that lead to excess capacity and changes in other factors.  In addition to the various assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above, we may strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposition or otherwise exiting businesses in response to changes in industry or market conditions, which may result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.  While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of goodwill and identifiable assets are reasonable, a change in those assumptions could affect their valuation and carrying values.    Income Taxes.  We use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and, also, for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns.  We must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and, also, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates, relative to our provision for income taxes, take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities.  Changes in tax law, or our interpretation of tax laws, and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets also takes into account predictions of the amount and the categories of future taxable income.  Actual operating results and the underlying amounts and categories of income in future years could result in our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes being inaccurate.    In accordance with the recognition standards established, we regularly perform a comprehensive review of uncertain tax positions.  In this regard, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes.  Until these positions are verified by the taxing authorities, or the statutes of limitations otherwise expire, we have recorded such positions as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.    Defined Benefit Plans.  On December 31, 2010, our management froze the plan benefits of our domestic defined benefit retirement plan.  Also, during 2010, we settled the obligations under our defined benefit supplemental retirement plan, which was contingent on the sale of Electrical.  The costs and obligations of our defined benefit plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions.  The three most critical assumptions used which impact our net periodic pension expense (income) and our benefit obligation are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase.  The discount rate is determined based on high-quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments.  For our pension obligations in the United States, a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with varying maturities is used to discount our expected benefit payments to their present value.  This generates our discount rate assumption for our domestic pension plans.  For our foreign plans, we use market rates for high quality corporate bonds to derive our discount rate assumption.  The expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected from our invested pension assets.  We have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios.  The rate of compensation increase represents the long-term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay-related plans.  These three assumptions are evaluated annually.  Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, as well as a change in future contributions to the plans.  However, we do not believe that a reasonable change in these assumptions would result in a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Refer to Note 8,  Employee benefit plans , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the primary assumptions used in determining the cost and obligations of our defined benefit plans.    Contingency Accruals.   During the normal course of business, a variety of issues arise which may result in litigation, environmental compliance and other contingent obligations.  In developing our contingency accruals, we consider both the likelihood of a loss or incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of exposure.  We record contingency accruals when a liability is probable and the amount of exposure can be reasonably estimated.  We periodically evaluate available information to assess whether contingency accruals should be adjusted, which includes an assessment of legal interpretations, judicial proceedings, recent case law and specific changes or developments regarding known claims. 160;In future periods, we could be required to record additional expenses, if our initial estimates were too low, or reverse part of the charges that were initially recorded, if our estimates were too high.  Additionally, the litigation costs we incur in connection with a contingency are expensed as incurred, since the nature of these costs is generally unpredictable and cannot be reasonably estimated prior to being incurred.             25           Severance, Impairment and Other Associated Costs.   We record severance, asset impairments and other charges, such as contract terminations costs, in response to declines in demand that lead to excess capacity, changing technology and other factors.  These costs, which we refer to as restructuring costs, are expensed when we determine that we have incurred those costs and, also, the requirements for accrual have been met in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.  Restructuring costs are recorded based upon our best estimates at the time the action is initiated.  Our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs.  If this occurs, we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods, if our initial estimates were too low, or reverse part of the initial charges, if our initial estimates were too high.  Additionally, the cash flow impact of an activity may not be recognized in the same period the expense has been incurred.    Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    In January 2010, FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) which requires additional disclosures related to transfers between levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurement.  This ASU was effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2009.  Adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.    In January, 2010, FASB issued an ASU to clarify the change in ownership guidance and to expand the required disclosures for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.  This ASU was effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2009.  Adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.    New Accounting Pronouncements    In October 2009, FASB issued an ASU to address the accounting for multiple-deliverable sales arrangements. This update provided guidance to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately, rather than as a combined unit.  This ASU also expanded the required disclosures related to a vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.  This guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.  We are currently evaluating the effect that this ASU may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.             26            Results of Operations    Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 25, 2009    The table below shows our results of operations and the changes in those results from period to period in both U.S. dollars and percentages ( dollars   in thousands ):                                                                   Results as %   of net sales                   2010             2009             Change $            Change %           2010             2009       Net sales      $  432,480        $  398,803        $  33,677           8.4  %        100.0  %        100.0  %    Cost of sales         323,865           298,035           ( 25,830  )        (8.7  )        ( 74.9  )        ( 74.7  )    Gross profit         108,615           100,768           7,847           7.8           25.1           25.3                                                                                    Selling, general and  administrative expenses          91,653            89,698           (1,955  )        (2.2  )        (21.2  )        (22.5  )    Severance, impairment and other  associated costs           32,799             82,867             50,068            60.4           ( 7.6  )        ( 20.8  )    Operating loss         (15,837  )        (71,797  )        55,960           77.9           (3.7  )        (18.0  )                                                                                 Interest expense, net         (4,853  )        (2,967  )        (1,886  )        (63.6  )        (1.1  )        (0.7  )    Other (expense) income, net         ( 4,356  )        3,784           ( 8,140  )        (215.1  )        ( 1.0  )        0.9                                                                                   Loss from continuing  operations before income taxes         (25,046  )        (70,980  )         45,934            64.7           (5.8  )        (17.8  )                                                                                 Income tax expense         2,691           1,879           ( 812  )        (43.2  )        ( 0.6  )        ( 0.5  )                                                                                 Net loss from continuing  operations         (27,737  )        (72,859  )        45,122           61.9           (6.4  )        (18.3  )                                                                                Net loss from discontinued  operations         ( 9,679  )        ( 119,978  )        110,299           91.9           ( 2.2  )        ( 30.1  )                                                                                Net loss      $  ( 37,416  )     $  ( 192,837  )     $  155,421           80.6  %        ( 8.6  )%        ( 48.4  )%        Net Sales . Our consolidated net sales increased by 8.4% primarily as a result of the improved net sales of our Network and Power segments particularly in our local area network, power management and automotive products.  Partially offsetting this improvement was  a decrease  in the demand for the products of our Wireless segment in both the mobile handset and audio markets.  The decreased demand in the mobile handset market was primarily caused by the loss of certain business with a major OEM customer due to a sourcing change, which began in the second half of 2009.  Additionally, we experienced lower U.S. dollar reported sales in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior year due to adverse changes in the foreign exchange rates of our non-U.S. dollar sales.    Gross Profit . Our consolidated gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 25.1% compared to 25.3% for the year ended December 25, 2009.  The decrease in our gross profit margin during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily the result of lower margins incurred by our Wireless segment caused by excess capacity due to the loss of certain business with a major OEM customer, accelerated depreciation realized on certain assets of Wireless and Power that became idle during 2010 and higher labor costs resulting from increased minimum wage rates in our manufacturing facilities in China.  Also, the results for the year ended December 25, 2009 were positively affected by business interruption insurance proceeds related to an earthquake that occurred in Mianyang, China during 2008.   Partially offsetting these decreases to our gross profit were cost-reduction and price increasing initiatives, the positive effects of manufacturing cost absorption from increased sales volume at Network and Power, a mix of sales in certain higher margin products and improved labor costs caused by a transition of operations to regions in China with lower wage rates.             27            Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .   Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to additional selling and marketing expenses caused by higher sales and, also, additional legal and incentive compensation costs.  Partially offsetting these increases was lower intangible amortization caused by the impairment charge recorded on certain finite intangible assets during the first six months of 2010 and a curtailment gain that resulted from freezing our domestic defined benefit retirement plan at the end of 2010.  For the year ended December 31, 2010, we were able to leverage our increased revenue on consistent selling, general and administrative spending which caused our selling, general and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales, to decline from the comparable period of 2009.    Research, development and engineering  expenses (“RD&E”) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  For the year ended December 31, 2010 and December 25, 2009, respectively, RD&E was as follows ( in thousands ):               2010          2009        RD&E      $  29,665        $  28,174       Percentage of sales         6.9  %        7.1  %      RD&E increased in the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $2.5 million of legal expenses incurred in conjunction with a patent claim in which we are a defendant.  Without the effects of the additional legal expenses, our RD&E, as a percentage of sales, was approximately 6.3%.  Our spending on RD&E activities tends to develop at a rate which is less dramatic than our sales changes.  Due to the increased level of sales we experienced in the year ended December 31, 2010, our RD&E as a percentage of sales was lower than historical levels. We believe that future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next-generation products.  As a result, design and development activities with our OEM customers continue at an aggressive pace consistent with our markets’ activity .    Severance, Impairment and Other Associated Costs .   During the year ended December 31, 2010, we determined that approximately $29.7 million of our wireless reporting unit’s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were impaired, including $3.6 million of technology related to our audio products.  Also, we recorded an impairment of $0.3 million to one of our indefinite-lived tradenames.  Refer to Note 4,  Goodwill and other intangible assets , to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.  Additionally, we incurred a charge of $2.7 million for a number of cost reduction actions.  These charges include severance and related payments of $1.9 million and fixed asset impairments of $0.8 million.  The impaired assets were identified in 2010 and primarily include machinery and equipment which were unable to be cost-efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes.    During the year ended December 25, 2009, we determined that approximately $71.0 million of our wireless reporting unit’s goodwill was impaired.  Additionally, we incurred a charge of $11.9 million for a number of cost reduction actions.  These charges include severance and related payments of $3.0 million and fixed asset impairments of $8.9 million.  The impaired assets were identified in 2009 and primarily include production lines associated with products that have no expected future demand and two real estate properties which were disposed.    Interest .  Net interest expense  increased  primarily as a result of the interest expense incurred on the convertible senior notes we issued during the fourth quarter of 2009.  Lower interest was incurred on borrowings from our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2010, because our debt outstanding under the facility decreased.  In both 2010 and 2009, interest on our outstanding loans and amortization of capitalized loan fees related to our credit agreement were allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on a pro-rata basis, based upon the debt repaid from the disposition of each of our discontinued operations as compared to our total debt outstanding .    Other .   Other expense or income is primarily attributable to our net foreign exchange activity on intercompany loans and advances among varying currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred foreign exchange losses of approximately $3.9 million as compared to foreign exchange gains of approximately $3.5 million during the comparable period of 2009.  The increase in foreign exchange losses was due to the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar to euro during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to a weakening of the U.S. dollar to euro in the same period of 2009.  Also, included in net other expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was a loss recorded to write-down an available-for-sale property to the net proceeds received on its sale.    Income Taxes .  The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was (10.7%) compared to a tax rate of (2.6%) for the year ended December 25, 2009.  The change in our effective tax rate is primarily due to lower goodwill impairment charges in 2010 compared to 2009, the expiration of certain non-U.S. tax holidays and reduced losses and non-deductible expenses incurred in certain jurisdictions where we expect limited tax benefits.             28            Discontinued Operations. Net  loss from discontinued operations was approximately $9.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to a loss of approximately $120.0 million in the year ended December 25, 2009.  The loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to a charge to reduce the net assets of Electrical to the net proceeds we received upon the completion of its sale.  The loss from discontinued operations incurred during the year ended December 25, 2009 was primarily attributable to estimated losses to write-down the net assets of Electrical to the net proceeds we anticipated receiving from the disposition and a charge to reduce the net assets of Medtech and MEMS to the actual net proceeds we received upon the completion of each sale.  Also, we recorded estimates for the settlement of certain accelerated retirement plan benefits at both Electrical and Medtech during the year ended December 25, 2009.  A summary of our net loss from each of our discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 25, 2009 is as follows ( in thousands ):               2010          2009        Electrical      $  (10,325  )     $  (61,926  )    Medtech         788             (48,399  )    MEMS          ( 142  )          ( 9,653  )         Total      $  ( 9,679  )     $  ( 119,978  )      Year ended December 25, 2009 compared to the year ended December 26, 2008    The table below shows our results of operations and the changes in those results from period to period in both U.S. dollars and percentages ( dollars   in thousands ):                                                          Results as %  of net sales               2009          2008          Change  $         Change  %            2009           2008       Net sales      $  398,803        $  626,270        $  (227,467  )        (36.3  )%        100.0  %        100.0  %    Cost of sales         298,035           477,763           179,728           37.6           ( 74.7  )        ( 76.3  )    Gross profit         100,768           148,507           (47,739  )        (32.1  )        25.3           23.7                                                                                    Selling, general and  administrative expenses          89,698            123,203            33,505            27.2           (22.5  )        (19.7  )    Severance, impairment and other  associated costs           82,867             153,294             70,427            45.9           ( 20.8  )        ( 24.5  )    Operating loss         (71,797  )        (127,990  )        56,193           43.9           (18.0  )        (20.5  )                                                                                 Interest expense, net         (2,967  )        (2,623  )        (344  )        (13.1  )        (0.7  )        (0.4  )    Other income, net         3,784           4,072           ( 288  )        (7.1  )        0.9           0.7                                                                                    Loss from continuing  operations before income taxes         (70,980  )        (126,541  )         55,561            43.9           (17.8  )        (20.2  )                                                                                 Income tax expense (benefit)         1,879           ( 2,998  )        ( 4,877  )        (162.7  )        ( 0.5  )        0.5                                                                                    Net loss from continuing  operations         (72,859  )        (123,553  )         50,694            41.0           (18.3  )        (19.7  )                                                                                 Net loss from discontinued  operations         ( 119,978  )        ( 151,467  )          31,489            20.8           ( 30.1  )        ( 24.2  )                                                                                 Net loss      $  ( 192,837  )     $  ( 275,020  )     $  82,183           29.9  %        ( 48.4  )%        ( 43.9  )%      Net Sales .  Our consolidated net sales decreased by 36.3% as a result of the decline in customer demand resulting from the adverse developments in the global economy.  The overall demand reduction realized during the year ended December 25, 2009 was incurred generally across our Network, Power and Wireless segments.  However, demand began to improve in the second half of 2009 in most markets.  Also, a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the euro experienced during the year ended December 25, 2009 as compared to the same period of 2008 resulted in lower U.S. dollar reported sales.             29            Gross Profit .  Our consolidated gross profit margin for the year ended December 25, 2009 was 25.3 % c ompared to 23. 7 % for the year ended December 26, 2008.  The increase in our gross profit margin during the year ended December 25, 2009 was primarily the result of the positive effects of cost-reduction and price increasing activities initiated in late 2008 as a response to the adverse conditions in the global economy.  Partially offsetting these activities was a decline in operating leverage as a result of decreased sales  generally across our Network, Power and Wireless segments  during 2009.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .  Total selling, general and administrative expenses  decreased primarily due to an overall emphasis on measures to reduce costs that were initiated at the end of 2008 in response to the overall economic downturn.  These measures reduced expenses across virtually all our administrative areas.  Also, intangible amortization expense declined compared to the 2008 period as a result of the impairment charges on finite-lived intangibles which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.    Research, development and engineering expenses (“RD&E”) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 25, 2009 and   December 26, 2008 ,  respectively, RD&E was as follows ( in thousands ):               2009          2008        RD&E      $  28,174        $  42,559       Percentage of sales         7.1  %        6.8  %      The decrease in research, development and engineering expenses is due to our cost reducing initiative that began at the end of 2008.  However, as a percentage of sales, 2009 spending was at a higher level as compared to the 2008 period.  We believe that future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next-generation products. As a result, design and development activities with our OEM customers continue at an aggressive pace consistent with market activity.    Severance, Impairment and Other Associated Costs .   During the year ended December 25, 2009, we determined that approximately $71.0 million of our wireless reporting unit’s goodwill was impaired.  Additionally, we incurred a charge of $11.9 million for a number of cost reduction actions.  These charges include severance and related payments of $3.0 million and fixed asset impairments of $8.9 million.  The impaired assets were identified in 2009 and primarily include production lines associated with products that have no expected future demand and two real estate properties which were disposed.    During 2008, we determined that $310.4 million of goodwill and other intangibles were impaired, including $170.3 million of goodwill and identifiable intangibles of a discontinued operation.  Additionally, we incurred a charge of $9.6 million for a number of cost reduction actions.  These charges include severance and related payments and other associated costs of $5.5 million resulting from the termination of certain manufacturing and support personnel in Asia, Europe and North America and, also, $4.1 million of other costs that primarily resulted from the transfer of manufacturing operations from Europe and North Africa to Asia.  We also recorded fixed asset impairments of $3.6 million.  The impaired assets were identified in 2008 and primarily include machinery and equipment that were unable to be cost-efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes.    Interest .  Net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the accelerated amortization of capitalized loan fees resulting from credit facility amendments effective in 2009.  Interest on our outstanding loans and amortization of capitalized loan fees were allocated between continuing and discontinued operations on a pro-rata basis for the year ended December 25, 2009 and the comparable period in 2008, based upon the actual and expected debt to be repaid as a result of the dispositions compared to total debt outstanding.  Also, i nterest income in the year ended December 25, 2009 was significantly lower than the comparable period in 2008 due to lower average cash balances during 2009.    Other .  The decrease in other income was primarily attributable to lower net foreign exchange gains realized during the year ended December 25, 2009 of $3.5 million, as compared to net foreign exchange gains of $4.1 million incurred in the comparable period of  2008.  The primary reason for the decrease in foreign exchange gains during the year ended December 25, 2009 was due to the effects of a larger strengthening of the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate during 2008 as compared to 2009.    Income Taxes .  The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 25, 2009 was (2.6%) compared to 2.4% for the year ended  December 26, 2008 .   The 2009 effective tax rate was affected by the $71.0 million of goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2009 which were non-deductible.  In addition, the 2009 tax rate was negatively impacted by certain losses and restructuring charges incurred by entities in jurisdictions where the future tax benefit is unlikely to be realized.             30            Discontinued Operations.   Net loss from discontinued operations was approximately $120.0 million during the year ended December 25, 2009 as compared to a loss of approximately $151.5 million in the year ended December 26, 2008. The loss from discontinued operations incurred during the year ended December 25, 2009 was primarily attributable to estimated losses to write-down the net assets of Electrical to the net proceeds we anticipated receiving from the disposition and, also, a charge to reduce the net assets of Medtech and MEMS to the actual net proceeds we received upon the completion of each sale.  Also, we recorded estimates for the settlement of certain accelerated retirement plan benefits at both Electrical and Medtech during the year ended December 25, 2009.  The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December, 2008 was primarily attributable to the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at Medtech.  A summary of our net loss from each of our discontinued operations for the years ended December 25, 2009 and December 26, 2008 is as follows ( in thousands ):               2009          2008        Electrical      $  (61,926  )     $  9,063       Medtech           (48,399  )        (159,277  )    MEMS           ( 9,653  )        ( 1,253  )    Total      $  ( 119,978  )     $  ( 151,467  )      Business Outlook    Our levels of net sales, customer mix and product mix have a significant impact on our gross margin, results of operations and cash flow.  Specifically, we achieved sales and operating profit during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2010 that were significantly above any of our recent periods.  This was primarily a result of increased sales volume across Network and Power, a mix of sales in higher margin products and our focus on containing our selling, general and administrative costs.  However, we anticipate that our sales and operating profit in the first quarter of 2011 will be lower than our levels in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Our profit margins continue to be challenged across all of our segments by increasing wage rates and material costs.  In addition, we expect Network’s margins to decrease due to lower prices which are effective during the first quarter of 2011.  Also, Wireless continues to be negatively impacted by a lack of capacity utilization.  To address these issues, we continue to focus on transitioning our operations from locations with higher wage rates, such as those in southern-China, to lower-cost areas in the central regions of China. Also, we continue our efforts toward streamlining our overall general and administrative expenses to achieve an optimal level of spending that is appropriate for the size and structure of our company.               We continue to commit resources to the development of new technologies and products that have higher forecasted margins, to the automation of certain manual manufacturing processes and to the expansion of our international sales, marketing and engineering teams in regions closest to our customers.  Also, we plan on continuing to adjust our marketing and engineering efforts at Wireless in order to increase revenue streams from a more diverse base of customers.  Our focus will be on wireless products with higher forecasted margins, while shifting from those markets where we expect limited returns, such as Wireless’ audio components, to streamline our operations and further simplify our business.    Considering the business issues mentioned above and other risks inherent in our company, we believe we have ample liquidity to fund our business requirements. This belief is based on our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, our history of positive operating cash flows, including $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and access to our credit facility.  Our credit agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants which are measured at the end of each fiscal quarter.  The primary covenants are senior secured debt and fixed charges compared to our rolling four-quarter EBITDA, as defined by our credit agreement.  At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all covenants of our credit agreement.  We substantially decreased our borrowings from the credit facility with the proceeds of the Electrical divestiture in September 2010 and through the issuance of $50.0 million of convertible senior notes in December 2009, which are not subject to the leverage or fixed charge covenant calculations in our credit agreement.  Accordingly, we believe that we will continue generating sufficient EBITDA in the foreseeable future to remain compliant with our debt covenants.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    Our working capital as of December 31, 2010 was $51.3 million, compared to $121.3 million as of December 25, 2009.  The decrease of $70.0 million was primarily due to the sale of Electrical’s net assets, that were held-for-sale as of December 25, 2009, and declines in accounts receivable and inventory, which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.  Cash and cash equivalents, which are included in working capital, decreased $3.8 million from $39.7 million as of December 25, 2009 to $35.9 million as of December 31, 2010.             31            We present our statement of cash flows using the indirect method.  Our management has found that investors and analysts typically refer to changes in accounts receivable, inventory and other components of working capital when analyzing operating cash flows.  Also, changes in working capital are more directly related to the way we manage our business’ cash flow than items such as cash receipts from the sale of goods, which would appear using the direct method.  All cash flows from our discontinued operations have been separated from continuing operations and are disclosed in aggregate by each cash flow activity.    Net cash provided by operating activities was $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $37.3 million in the comparable period of 2009, a decrease of $5.0 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in net working capital changes in the year ended December 31, 2010 which were less than the reductions during the year ended December 25, 2009.    Capital expenditures were $9.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 and $2.2 million in 2009.  The increase of $7.0 million primarily resulted from our focus on allocating resources toward next generation technologies during 2010 compared to a concerted effort to limit new investment to only essential programs in 2009.  We make capital expenditures to expand production capacity and to improve our operating efficiency.  We plan to continue making such expenditures  at a similar or increased manner in the future when necessary.    We paid $4.1 million for dividend payments during the year ended December 31, 2010.  On November 8, 2010 we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per common share, payable on January 21, 2011 to shareholders of record on January 7, 2011.  This quarterly dividend resulted in a cash payment to shareholders of approximately $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2011.  We expect cash payments for dividends to be approximately $4.1 million in 2011.    On September 2, 2010, we completed the sale of the Electrical business in Europe and Asia for approximately $52.0 million, subject to normal working capital and other financial adjustments. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we contributed approximately $6.2 million to fund an irrevocable grantor trust that was designated for benefit payments to participants under our defined benefit supplemental retirement plan, which was contingent on the sale of Electrical.  Following the sale of Electrical’s operations in Europe and Asia, we made benefit payments of approximately $13.6 million and incurred approximately $2.2 million of special termination benefits to settle the obligations under our defined benefit supplemental retirement plan.  The remaining proceeds from the Electrical disposition, net of the defined benefit plan settlement, transaction fees and other related costs, were used in the third quarter of 2010 to reduce debt outstanding under our credit facility.    On January 4, 2010, we completed the sale of Electrical’s North American business for an amount immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  The net proceeds were primarily used to repay debt outstanding under our credit facility.    Our domestic defined benefit retirement plan is currently under audit by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (“PBGC”).  Initial communications from the PBGC have indicated that the sale of Electrical’s North American operations may have resulted in a partial plan termination, which may require us to accelerate the funding of up to approximately $7.3 million to this defined benefit plan.  However, a partial plan termination would only result in a cash payment to fund our plan assets and will not directly result in additional expenses.  As of the date these financial statements were issued, we were continuing discussions with the PBGC on this matter.    At December 31, 2010 our management froze the plan benefits under our domestic defined benefit retirement plan, which resulted in a curtailment gain of approximately $1.0 million recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.    On December 2, 2009, we finalized an amendment to our credit agreement that permitted us to issue senior convertible notes and restated certain other provisions of our previous credit agreement. The amended and restated credit agreement provides for a $100.0 million senior revolving credit facility and provides for borrowing in U.S. dollars, euros and yen, with a multicurrency facility providing for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed the U.S. dollar equivalent of $10.0 million.    Our credit agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants which are measured at the end of each fiscal quarter.  The primary covenants are total debt, excluding our convertible senior notes, and fixed charges as compared to our rolling twelve-month EBITDA.  If we are unable to maintain the required EBITDA levels relative to our total debt, excluding our convertible senior notes, or fixed charges, we would default on our covenants.  As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all covenants of our credit agreement.  We had approximately $32.2 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility with approximately $66.4 million of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2010.  Refer to Note 6,  Debt , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.             32           We had three standby letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate amount of $1.4 million securing transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business, which are included in our maximum  borrowing capacity as December 31, 2010.    On December 22, 2009, we issued $50.0 million in convertible senior notes, which will mature on December 15, 2014.  The notes bear a coupon rate of 7.0% per annum that is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year.  During the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid approximately $3.5 million of interest related to the semi-annual coupon rate on the convertible senior notes.  We expect to pay a total of $3.5 million of interest on those notes in 2011.  We incurred debt issuance costs of approximately $2.5 million in 2009, which have been deferred and are being amortized over the life of the notes.  Refer to Note 6,  Debt , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.    The net decrease in cash resulting from cash flows of our discontinued operations was $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Cash used in operating activities of our discontinued operations was approximately $8.9 million, which primarily resulted from changes in working capital and the net losses of these operations excluding depreciation, amortization and impairment charges.  Our discontinued operations also had capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 million and cash on hand, that we retained in the disposition, of approximately $9.4 million, which were both included in our investing cash outflows from discontinued operations.  We do not expect these uses of cash to recur and we also do not expect significant continuing cash flows from these operations after their disposition.     We are a party to various legal proceedings, claims and assessments that arise in the ordinary course of business, and may continue to incur significant costs in defending or settling legal matters.  The total amount and timing of the expected future payments related to these matters cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the duration of the legal proceedings and the ultimate scope of other claims.  However, an unfavorable outcome in a single matter or in multiple legal matters during the same reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.     We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed in July 2007 by Halo Electronics, Inc. in the United States District Court, District of Nevada.  The case is captioned Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Engineering, Inc. and Technitrol, Inc., Case No. 2:07-cv-00331-PMP-PAL.  The plaintiff claims that we infringed certain U.S, patents related to an electronic surface mount package and is seeking injunctive relief and damages.  Discovery has been completed and summary judgment motions are now pending.  The parties have requested that the trial begin in our second fiscal quarter of 2011, but a trial date has not yet been scheduled.  We believe we have complete defenses to all claims asserted and therefore have no liability to the plaintiff.  However, the plaintiff has produced expert reports asserting infringement and liability in the amount of $34.3 million, plus trebling and attorneys fees, and a judgment in favor of the plaintiff may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.  During 2010, we incurred approximately $2.5 million of legal expenses related to this matter.     During 2011, we expect to settle an audit related to one of our subsidiary’s income tax filings.  This potential audit settlement could result in a cash payment of as much as $6.3 million.    We are currently in negotiations to sell the audio business of our Wireless segment and expect an agreement of sale to be finalized during the first quarter of 2011.  The net proceeds are estimated to be immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements.    On February 10, 2011, we announced that our corporate headquarters, currently located in Trevose, Pennsylvania, will be consolidated into our U.S. operational headquarters in San Diego, California.  We are now a pure-play electronic components provider, which has made a corporate structure with a stand-alone corporate headquarters and senior managers at two locations no longer efficient. This consolidation will occur in 2011 in connection with our actions to simplify and streamline our company’s organizational structure. We estimate that we will incur approximately $2.0 million of severance and other associated costs over 2011 and 2012 related to the consolidation of our headquarters, which will generate an estimated annual cost savings of approximately $1.0 million once the transition is complete.    The principal material change in our contractual obligations during the year ended December 31, 2010 was the elimination of obligations related to our former Electrical operations in Europe, Asia and North America, which included outstanding commercial commitments under precious metal consignment-type leases of approximately $113.4 million as of December 25, 2009.  Also, the contractual obligations related to our defined benefit supplemental retirement plan were settled during the year ended December 31, 2010.             33            As of December 31, 2010, future payments related to contractual obligations were as follows ( in thousands ):                Amounts expected to be paid by period               Total (1   )      Less than 1 year          1 to 3 years          3 to 5 years          Thereafter                                                          Long-term debt      $  32,150        $  --        $  32,150        $  --        $  --       Convertible senior notes      $  50,000        $  --        $  --        $  50,000        $  --       Estimated interest payments      $  15,943        $  4,397        $  8,046        $  3,500        $  --       Operating leases      $  14,003        $  6,202        $  3,968        $  1,649        $  2,184       Retirement plans       $  34,628        $  1,868        $  3,906        $  4,096        $  24,758                     (1)    Excludes other obligations under employment contracts that are generally only payable upon a change of control.          In the schedule of estimated future payments related to our contractual obligations, we excluded unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty of the amount and the period of payment.  As of December 31, 2010, we had unrecognized tax benefits of  approximately $17.7 million.   Refer to Note 7,  Income taxes , to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    We believe that the combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future. In addition, we may use internally generated funds or obtain additional borrowings or equity offerings for suitable acquisitions of businesses or assets.    Currently, a majority owned subsidiary holds approximately $14.8 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents.  Permanent access to funds from this subsidiary could be in the form of a dividend to its shareholders, which could result in income withholding taxes and distributions to minority shareholders.  As of December 31, 2010 there are no plans to repatriate funds held at this majority owned subsidiary.  During the first quarter of 2011, this majority owned subsidiary announced a plan to purchase its own common stock that is publically traded on a foreign exchange.  As of the date these financial statements were issued, the majority owned subsidiary purchased approximately $3.5 million of its own common stock with its cash on hand.  Such spending may continue under similar common stock buy back plans in the foreseeable future.    With the exception of the cash and cash equivalents located at the majority owned subsidiary, we have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and no restrictions are foreseen. However, foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal  cash movements from time to time. We expect to reinvest this cash and earnings outside of the United States, because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for future growth will be abroad.  In addition, we expect to use a significant portion of the cash to service debt outside the United States.  Thus,  with the exception of earnings in the amount of $8.5 million, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $475.0 million of our non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings that  have been indefinitely invested abroad.  If these earnings were brought back to the United States, significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the United States as several countries in which we operate have tax rates significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate.    Our retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions as of December 31, 2010, with the exception of approximately $29.8 million of subsidiary retained earnings primarily in China, that are restricted in accordance with Section 58 of the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprises Law.  The $29.8 million includes approximately $6.7 million of retained earnings of a majority owned subsidiary.  The amount restricted in accordance with the PRC Foreign Investment  Enterprise Law is applicable to all foreign investment enterprises doing business in China. The restriction applies to 10% of our net earnings in China, limited to 50% of the total capital invested .    Item 7a      Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    Interest Rate Risk    Our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility, are exposed to changes in interest rates in both the U.S. and abroad.  We invest our excess cash in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities.  We generally limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extent practical.  Our Board of Directors has adopted policies relating to these risks and continually monitors compliance with these policies.             34            Our revolving credit facility has variable interest rates.  Accordingly, interest expense may increase if we borrow and/or if the rates associated with our borrowings increase. In addition, we may pursue additional or alternative financing.  We may also use financial derivatives such as interest rate swaps or other instruments in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates.  However, we have not used any of these instruments to date.     We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Financial Statements which would materially affect our current or future financial condition or results from operations.      The table below presents principal amounts in U.S. dollars and the related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations.  The column captioned “Approximate Fair Value” sets forth the carrying value of our long-term debt as of December 31, 2010 after taking into consideration the current interest rates on our credit facility and the current bid price on our convertible senior notes ( in thousands ):                 2011            2012            2013               2014               2015          There-  After            Total          Approx.   Fair    Value        Liabilities                                                                             Convertible senior notes                                                                             Fixed rate:                                                                             US Dollar         --           --           --        $  50,000           --           --        $  50,000        $  54,500       Weighted average interest rate         --           --           --           7.00  %        --           --                               Long-term debt                                                                                                     Variable rate  (1):                                                                                                     US Dollar         --           --        $  32,150           --           --           --        $  32,150        $  33,164       Weighted average interest rate         --           --           2.79  %        --           --           --                                            (1)    The weighted average interest rate reflects the applicable interest rate as of December 31, 2010 and is subject to change in accordance with the terms of our amended credit facility.        Foreign Currency Risk    As of December 31, 2010, we had a substantial amount of assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  We conduct business in various foreign currencies, including those of non-hyperinflationary emerging market countries in Asia as well as European countries.  We may utilize derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts in connection with fair value hedges, to manage foreign currency risks.  Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognized in income along with adjustments of carrying amounts of the hedged items.  Therefore, all of our forward exchange contracts are marked-to-market, and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income.  These contracts guarantee a predetermined rate of exchange at the time the contract is purchased.  This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee.  We believe there are two primary risks of holding these instruments.  The first is that the foreign currency being hedged could move in a direction which would create a better economic outcome than if the hedging instrument was not in place.  The second risk is that the counterparty to a currency hedge defaults on its obligations.  We reduce the risk of counterparty default by entering into relatively short-term hedges with well capitalized and highly rated banks.  In determining the use of forward exchange contracts, we consider the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies, the type of currency and the costs associated with the contracts.    During the year ended December 31, 2010, we utilized forward contracts to sell forward euro to receive Chinese renminbi.  These contracts are used to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations at our operations in China.  At December 31, 2010, we had six foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately 5.5 million euro, or approximately $7.4 million, to receive Chinese renminbi.  The fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of $0.5 million as determined through use of Level 2 inputs as defined in ASC Topic 815.  At December 25, 2009, we had seven foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately 7.0 million euro, or approximately $10.1 million, to receive Chinese renminbi. ; The fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of $0.2 million as determined through use of Level 2 inputs.             35             The table below provides information about our other non-derivative, non-U.S. dollar denominated financial instruments and presents the information in equivalent U.S. dollars ( in thousands ):                2011          2012          2013             2014             2015          There-  After          Total          Approx.
