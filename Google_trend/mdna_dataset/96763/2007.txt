Item 7     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations  Introduction                   This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as well as othersections of this report, contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaningof the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements formany reasons, including the risks faced by us described in Risk Factors section of thisreport on page 8 through 14.  Critical Accounting Policies                                                                                                                                  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amountsreported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the consolidatedfinancial statements in pages 42 through 44 describes the significant accounting policies and methodsused in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are used for, but notlimited to, the accounting for inventory valuation, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles,severance and asset impairment expense, income taxes, and contingency accruals. Actual results coulddiffer from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantlyby judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.                   Inventory Valuation . We carry our inventories at lower of cost or market. We establish inventory provisions to write downexcess and obsolete inventory to market value. We utilize historical trends and customer forecaststo estimate expected usage of on-hand inventory. In addition, inventory purchases are based uponfuture demand forecasts estimated by taking into account actual sales of our products over recenthistorical periods and customer forecasts. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demandfor our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changingtechnology or customer requirements, we may be required to write down our inventory and our grossmargin could be negatively affected. Conversely, if we were to sell or use a significant portionof inventory already written down, our gross margin could be positively affected.                   Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles . We assess the carrying cost of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annualbasis and on an interim basis in certain circumstances. This assessment is based on comparing fairvalue to carrying cost. Fair value is based on estimating future cash flows using various growthassumptions and discounting based on a present value factor. Assigning a useful life and periodicallyreassessing a remaining useful life (for purposes of systematic amortization) is also predicatedon various economic assumptions. Our intangible assets are also subject to impairment as a resultof other factors such as changing technology, declines in demand that lead to excess capacity andother factors. In addition to the various assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above, wemay strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exitingbusinesses in response to changes in industry or market conditions, which could result in an impairmentof goodwill or other intangibles.                    Severance and Asset Impairment Expense.   We record severance, tangible asset impairments and other restructuring charges such as leaseterminations, in response to declines in demand that lead to excess capacity, changing technologyand other factors. These costs, which we refer to as restructuring costs, are expensed during theperiod in which we determine that we will incur those costs, and all of the requirements for accrualare met in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. Restructuring costs are recorded basedupon our best estimates at the time the action is initiated. Our actual expenditures for the restructuringactivities may differ from the initially recorded costs. If this occurs, we could be required eitherto record additional expenses in future periods if our initial estimates were too low, or reversepart of the charges that we recorded initially if our initial estimates were too high. In the caseof acquisition-related restructuring costs, depending on whether certain requirements are met inaccordance with the applicable accounting guidance, such costs would generally require a change invalue of the goodwill appearing on our balance sheet, which may not affect our earnings.                    Income Taxes.   We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, incometax expense/benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current yearand for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have beenrecognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. We must make assumptions, judgmentsand estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assetsand liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our judgments,assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account currenttax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future auditsconducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of taxlaws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts providedfor income taxes in our      20        consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value ofa deferred tax asset take in to account predictions of the amount and category of future taxableincome. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future yearscould render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate.Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income taxobligations to differ from our estimates.                   Contingency Accruals.  During the normal course of business, a variety of issues may arise, which may result in litigation,environmental compliance and other contingent obligations. In developing our contingency accrualswe consider both the likelihood of a loss or incurrence of a liability as well as our ability toreasonably estimate the amount of exposure. We record contingency accruals when a liability is probableand the amount can be reasonably estimated. We periodically evaluate available information to assesswhether contingency accruals should be adjusted. Our evaluation includes an assessment of legal interpretations,judicial proceedings, recent case law and specific changes or developments regarding known claims.We could be required to record additional expenses in future periods if our initial estimates weretoo low, or reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially if our estimates were too high.  Overview                   We are a global producer of precision-engineered electronic components and electrical contact productsand materials. We believe we are a leading global producer of these products and materials in theprimary markets we serve based on our estimates of the size of our primary markets in annual revenuesand our share of those markets relative to our competitors.                   We operate our business in two distinct segments:              Pulse, which manufactures electronic components, and              AMI Doduco, which manufactures electrical contact products.                          General .  We define net sales as gross sales less returns and allowances. We sometimes refer to net salesas revenue.                   Historically, the gross margin at Pulse has been significantly higher than at AMI Doduco. As a result,the mix of net sales generated by Pulse and AMI Doduco during a period affects our consolidated grossmargin. Additionally, our gross margin is affected by our acquisitions, such as LK and ERA. Our grossmargin is also significantly affected by capacity utilization, particularly in higher fixed-costoperations in AMI Doduco and Pulses antenna and automotive divisions. AMI Doducos, andto a lesser extent Pulses, gross margin is also affected by the price of precious and non-preciousmetals that are passed through to customers at nominal margins. Pulses markets are characterizedby relatively short product life cycles compared to AMI Doduco. As a result, significant productturnover occurs each year. Therefore, Pulses changes in average selling prices do not necessarilyprovide a meaningful and quantifiable measure of Pulses operations. AMI Doduco has a relativelylong-term and mature product line, with less turnover, and with less frequent variation in the pricesof product sold, relative to Pulse. Many of AMI Doducos products are sold under annual (orlonger) purchase contracts. Therefore, AMI Doducos revenues historically have not been subjectto significant price fluctuations. In addition, sales growth and contraction at AMI Doduco and Pulsesconsumer, antenna and automotive divisions are generally attributable to changes in unit volume andchanges in unit pricing, as well as foreign exchange rates, especially the U.S. dollar to the euro.                    Acquisitions .  Acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy. In many cases, our move intonew product lines and extensions of our existing product lines or markets has been facilitated byan acquisition. Our acquisitions continually change the mix of our net sales. We have made numerousacquisitions in recent years which have increased our penetration into our primary markets and expandedour presence in new markets. We acquired a controlling interest in FRE in late 2004. FRE isbased in Taiwan and manufactures connector products, including single and multiple-port jacks, andsupplies such products to Pulse under a cooperation agreement. LK was acquired in September 2005for approximately $111.1 million, net of cash acquired and including acquisition costs and the considerationresulting from an earn-out provision. LK is based in Kempele, Finland, and is a producer of internalantennas and integrated modules for mobile communications and information devices. ERA was acquiredin January 2006 for approximately $53.4 million, net of cash acquired and including acquisition costs.ERA is based in Herrenberg, Germany and is a leading producer of electronic coils and transformersprimarily for the European automotive, heating/ventilation/air conditioning and appliance markets.We purchased Larsen from Radiall Incorporated in December 2006. Larsen is headquartered in Vancouver,Washington and manufactures advanced antenna systems for non-cellular wireless and automotive applications.We will continue to pursue additional growth opportunities.     21                         Divestiture.    In 2005, we received approximately $6.7 million for the sale of AMI Doducos bimetaland metal cladding operations. We have reflected the results of the bimetal and metal cladding operationsas discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.                    Technology.    Our business is continually affected by changes in technology, design, and preferencesof consumers and other end users of our products, as well as changes in regulatory requirements.We address these changes by continuing to invest in new product development and by maintaining adiverse product portfolio which contains both mature and emerging technologies in order to meet customerdemands.                   Management Focus.    Our executives focus on a number of important factors in evaluating our financial conditionand operational performance. For example, we use economic profit, which we define as operating profitafter tax less our cost of capital on employed resources, revenue growth, gross profit as a percentageof revenue, and operating profit as a percent of revenue. Operating leverage or incremental operatingprofit as a percentage of incremental sales is a factor that is discussed frequently, as this isbelieved to reflect the benefit of absorbing fixed overhead and operating expenses. In evaluatingworking capital management, liquidity and cash flow, our executives also use performance measuressuch as days sales outstanding, days payable outstanding, inventory turnover and cash conversionefficiency. The continued success of our business is largely dependent on meeting and exceeding ourcustomers expectations. Therefore, non-financial performance measures relating to on-time deliveryand quality assist our management in monitoring customer satisfaction on an on-going basis.                   Cost Reduction Programs.  As a result of our focus on both economic and operating profit, we will aggressively size both Pulseand AMI Doduco so that costs are optimally matched to current and anticipated future revenues andunit demand. We continue to engage in a succession of cost reduction initiatives and programs. Theamounts of additional charges will depend on specific actions taken. The actions taken over the pastseveral years such as plant closures, plant relocations, asset impairments and reduction in personnelat the affected locations have resulted in the elimination of a variety of costs. The majority ofthese costs represent the annual salaries and benefits of terminated employees, both those directlyrelated to manufacturing and those providing selling, general and administrative services, as wellas lower overhead costs related to factory relocations to lower-cost locations. The eliminated costsalso include depreciation savings from disposed equipment.                    In the year ended December 29, 2006, we accrued $8.8 million for a number of actions to further streamlineoperations at Pulse and AMI Doduco. These include severance and related payments to manufacturingand support personnel of $6.8 million and $2.0 million to write down the value of certain fixed assetsto their disposal values. The majority of these accruals will be paid by March 30, 2007, except forremaining lease or severance payments to be made over a specified term.                    In the year ended December 30, 2005, we accrued $7.0 million for a number of actions to streamlineoperations at Pulse and AMI Doduco. These include $4.4 million related to the termination ofmanufacturingand support personnel and $2.6 million to writedown the value of certain fixedassets to theirdisposalvalues. The majority of these accruals were paid by March 31, 2006,except for remaininglease orseverance payments to be made over a specified term. Additionally,we recorded a $46.0million impairmentcharge of Pulse consumer division assets consisting of$25.6 million of goodwill,$11.5 million ofidentifiable intangibles, and $8.9 million of property,plant, and equipment.These impairments resultedfrom updated cash flow projections which reflectthe shift of productionby Pulse to China-basedlocations, decreasing average selling pricesfor television transformersresulting from competitionwith Asian companies selling in U.S. dollars,and the recent weaknessin the European televisionmarket for flyback transformers.                   In the year ended December 31, 2004, we accrued $9.0 million which included severance and related paymentsof $7.5 million to terminate manufacturing and support personnel and $1.5 million to write down thevalue of certain fixed assets to their disposal values. The vast majority of these accruals wereutilized by the end of the second quarter in 2005. Additionally we recorded an intangible asset impairmentof $18.9 million related to acquired intangibles. These intangible asset impairments resulted fromupdated cash flow projections relating to technology and customer relationships, and reflect, amongother things, shifting product mixes, changes among major customers and continuing pressures on sellingprices in the consumer and telecommunication product divisions of the Pulse segment.                   International Operations.   As of December 29, 2006, we had manufacturing operations in 10 countries and had no significantnet sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the euro and the Chinese renminbi. A large percentageof our sales in recent years have been outside of the United States. Changing exchange rates oftenimpact our financial results and our period-over-period comparisons. This is particularly true ofmovements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar, renminbi and the euro. AMI DoducosEuropean and Pulses consumer and automotive division sales are denominated primarily ineuro. Pulses antenna division sales are denominated primarily in euro and renminbi. Sales andearnings denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar may result in higher or lower dollarsales and net earnings upon translation for our U.S. consolidated financial statements. We may alsoexperience a positive or negative      22        translation adjustment to equity because our investments in Pulses consumer, antenna and automotivedivisions and AMI Doducos European operations may be worth more or less in U.S. dollarsafter translation for our U. S. consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency gains or lossesmay also be incurred when non-functional currency -denominated transactions are remeasured to anoperations functional currency for financial reporting purposes. If a higher percentage ofour sales is denominated in non-U.S. currencies, increased exposure to currency fluctuations may result.                    In order to reduce our exposure resulting from currency fluctuations, we may purchase currency exchangeforward contracts and/or currency options. These contracts guarantee a predetermined range of exchangerates at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk ofcurrency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. In determining theuse of forward exchange contracts and currency options, we consider the amount of sales, purchasesand net assets or liabilities denominated in local currencies, the type of currency, and the costsassociated with the contracts. As of December 29, 2006, we did not have any forward contracts orcurrency options in place.                  PreciousMetals.   AMI Doduco uses silver, as well as other precious metals, in manufacturing some of its electricalcontacts, contact materials and contact subassemblies. Historically, we have leased or held thesematerials through consignment-type arrangements with our suppliers. Leasing and consignment costshave typically been below the costs to borrow funds to purchase the metals, and more importantly,these arrangements eliminate the effects of fluctuations in the market price of owned precious metaland enable us to minimize our inventories. AMI Doducos terms of sale generally allow us tocharge customers for precious metal content based on market value of precious metal on the day aftershipment to the customer. Thus far we have been successful in managing the costs associated withour precious metals. While limited amounts are purchased for use in production, the majority of ourprecious metal inventory continues to be leased or held on consignment. If our leasing/consignmentfees increase significantly in a short period of time, and we are unable to recover these increasedcosts through higher sale prices, a negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity mayresult. Leasing/consignment fee increases are caused by increases in interest rates or volatilityin the price of the consigned material.                   IncomeTaxes.   Our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in high-taxjurisdictions such as those in Europe and the income earned in low-tax jurisdictions, particularlyTunisia and the Peoples Republic of China. This mix of income can vary significantly from oneperiod to another. We have benefited over recent years from favorable tax incentives, however, thereis no guarantee as to how long these benefits will continue to exist.                    Except in limited circumstances, we have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholdingtaxes on our non-U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings as per APB No. 23 .   Such earnings may include pre-acquisition earnings of foreign entities acquired through stockpurchases, and are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. Where excess cashhas accumulated in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and it is advantageous for tax reasons, subsidiary earningsmay be remitted.  Results of Operations  Year ended December 29, 2006 compared to the year ended December 30, 2005                   Net Sales.    Net sales for the year ended December 29, 2006 increased $337.7 million, or 54.8%, to $954.1 millionfrom $616.4 million in the year ended December 30, 2005. Our sales increase from 2005 was primarilyattributable to the inclusion of a full year of antenna division net sales, the addition of automotivedivision net sales beginning in January 2006 and higher pass-through costs of precious and non-preciousmetals at AMI Doduco.                    Pulses net sales increased $265.9 million, or 73.5%, to $627.5 million for the year ended December29, 2006 from $361.6 million in the year ended December 30, 2005. Pulse sales benefited from theinclusion of antenna division net sales for a full year and automotive division sales from the timeof acquisition in January 2006. In addition, Pulses net sales in 2006 increased as comparedto 2005 as a result of higher net sales in the networking, telecommunications and power conversionbusinesses.                   AMI Doducos net sales increased $71.8 million, or 28.2%, to $326.6 million for the year endedDecember 29, 2006 from $254.8 million in the year ended December 30, 2005. This was primarily a resultof higher prices for silver and other precious and non-precious metals which were passed on to customersand, to a lesser extent, increased global demand.                    Cost of Sales.    Our cost of sales increased $261.5 million, or 55.2%, to $735.0 million for the year endedDecember 29, 2006 from $473.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2005 primarily due to highernet sales.      23        Included in cost of sales for the year-ended December 29, 2006 is approximately $5.0 million of accelerateddepreciation related to equipment taken out of service before the end of its originally intendeduseful life. Our consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 29, 2006 was 23.0%, comparedwith 23.2% in the year ended December 30, 2005.                    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 29, 2006 increased$32.2 million to $139.0 million from $106.8 million for the year ended December 30, 2005. The increasein expense for the year ended December 29, 2006 is primarily a result of the inclusion of Pulse antennadivision and automotive division spending in the 2006 period. As a percentage of net sales, selling,general and administrative expenses was 14.6% in the year ended December 29, 2006 versus 17.3% inthe comparable period of 2005, or a decrease of 2.7% of net sales. Decreased spending as a percentageof net sales was a result of an overall leveraging of operating costs across a larger sales base.Additionally, the restructuring actions that we took over the past year to reduce costs contributedto lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales.                    Research, development and engineering expenses are included in selling, general and administrativeexpenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. For the year endedDecember 29, 2006 and December 30, 2005 respectively, RD&E by segment was as follows ( dollars in thousands ):            2006     2005                                Pulse  $   35,045     $   21,359             Percentage of segment sales     5.6  %     5.9  %                                       AMI Doduco  $   4,540     $   4,137             Percentage of segment sales     1.4  %     1.6  %                               Higher RD&E spending in 2006 at Pulse is attributable to activities at the Pulse antenna and automotivedivisions since their acquisition dates. As a percentage of sales, RD&E spending was lower in2006 then in 2005. Strong end-user demand at Pulse and AMI Doduco, as well as higher pass-throughcosts of silver and other metals at AMI Doduco, resulted in increased sales that were greater ona percentage basis then increases in RD&E spending. We believe that future sales in the electroniccomponents markets will be driven by next-generation products. Design and development activitieswith our OEM customers continued at an aggressive pace during 2006 and into 2007.                    Severance and Asset Impairment Expense.   Total severance and asset impairment expense for the year ended December 29, 2006 decreased$44.2 million, to $8.8 million from $53.0 million for the year ended December 30, 2005. The decreasein the 2006 period is primarily attributable to $46.0 million of asset impairments related to thePulse consumer division which were recognized in the 2005 period.                   In the year ended December 29, 2006, we accrued $8.8 million for a number of actions to further streamlineoperations at Pulse and AMI Doduco. These include severance and related payments of $6.8 millionto manufacturing and support personnel and $2.0 million to write down the value of certain fixedassets to their disposal values. The majority of these accruals will be paid by March 30, 2007, exceptfor remaining lease or severance payments to be made over a specified term.                    In the year ended December 30, 2005, we accrued $7.0 million for a number of actions to streamlineoperations at Pulse and AMI Doduco. These include $4.4 million related to the termination ofmanufacturingand support personnel and $2.6 million to writedown the value of certain fixedassets to theirdisposalvalues. The majority of these accruals were paid by March 31, 2006,except for remaininglease orseverance payments to be made over a specified term. Additionally,we recorded a $46.0million impairmentcharge of Pulse consumer division assets consisting of$25.6 million of goodwill,$11.5 million ofidentifiable intangibles, and $8.9 million of property,plant, and equipment.These impairments resultedfrom updated cash flow projections which reflectthe shift of productionby Pulse to China-basedlocations, decreasing average selling pricesfor television transformersresulting from competitionwith Asian companies selling in U.S. dollars,and the recent weaknessin the European televisionmarket for flyback transformers.                   Interest .  Net interest expense was $5.3 million for the year ended December 29, 2006 compared to netinterest income of $1.4 million for the year ended December 30, 2005. The increase in interest expensein the 2006 period is primarily attributable to higher precious metal leasing costs, expenses resultingfrom increased average borrowings from our multi-currency credit facility and a lower balance ofinvested cash in the 2006 period as compared to 2005. Recurring aggregate components of interestexpense, such as bank commitment fees, approximated those of 2005.                    Other Income (Expense).   Other income (expense) was $4.1 million of income for the year ended December 29, 2006 versus$1.7 million of expense for the year ended December 30, 2005. The change is primarily attributableto foreign exchange gains of approximately $3.9 million in the 2006 period as compared to foreignexchange losses of      24       approximately $2.2 million in the 2005 period. On average, the euro to US dollar exchange rate increasedduring 2006 whereas it decreased during 2005. This factor, along with increased international activityin 2006, resulted in an overall increase of foreign exchange gains.                   Income Taxes.   The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 29, 2006 was 16.7% compared to (35.5%)for the year ended December 30, 2005. The tax rate in 2006 reflects a higher proportion of incomebeing attributable to low-tax jurisdictions. In 2005, the non-deductibility of the Pulse consumerdivision impairment charge, a $7.3 million charge related to the Section 965 dividend and the effectof non-deductible restructuring expenses in high-tax jurisdictions negatively impacted the tax rate.                    Minority Interest.    Minority interest was $1.5 million for the year ended December 29, 2006 versus $0.9 millionfor the year ended December 30, 2005. The increase in minority interest expense was due to the improvedfinancial performance of FRE, which was offset by our increased ownership percentage of FRE in the2006 period as compared to 2005.  Results of Operations  Year ended December 30, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004                   Net Sales.    Net sales for the year ended December 30, 2005 increased $55.1 million, or 9.8%, to $616.4 millionfrom $561.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Our sales increase from 2004 was primarilyattributable to the inclusion of LK Products Oy (LK) net sales from the time of acquisitionin September 2005, the inclusion of Full Rise Electronic Co., Ltd. (FRE) net sales fromthe time we acquired a controlling interest in September 2004, and to improvement in the marketsfor AMI Doduco. Pulses increase in net sales also reflects the inclusion of LKs net salesfrom the time of acquisition in September 2005 and FREs net sales from the time we acquireda controlling interest in September 2004. AMI Doducos increase in net sales was primarily dueto higher prices for precious and non-precious metals, as well as stronger economic growth and successesin AMI Doducos efforts to increase its market share.                    Pulses net sales increased $41.4 million, or 12.9%, to $361.6 million for the year ended December30, 2005 from $320.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Pulse sales benefited from theinclusion of LKs net sales from the time of acquisition in September 2005 and FREs netsales for twelve months of 2005. However, sales derived from the consumer division (which are denominatedin euros) were lower than in the 2004 period. Additionally, revenues from networking, telecommunications,power conversion and military/aerospace markets were lower overall in 2005 than in 2004.                   AMI Doducos net sales increased $13.7 million, or 5.7%, to $254.8 million for the year endedDecember 30, 2005 from $241.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. The sales benefited fromhigher prices for precious and non-precious metals which were passed on to customers. Sales in the2005 period reflect improving demand in North America and Europe, and were also favorably affectedby certain increases related to new long-term contracts with major customers.                    Cost of Sales.    Our cost of sales increased $57.5 million, or 13.8%, to $473.5 million for the year endedDecember 30, 2005 from $416.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to highernet sales. Our consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 30, 2005 was 23.2%, comparedwith 25.9% in the year ended December 31, 2004. Our consolidated gross margin in 2005 was negativelyaffected by:             decreased gross margin on Pulse consumer division sales, which was negatively impacted by the continuing  weak U.S. dollar relative to the euro and lower demand for television sets in Europe;                    increases in statutory minimum wages and social costs in China; and                     higher costs for pass through materials at AMI Doduco.           These negative impacts on gross margin were partially offset by the higher capacity utilization atPulse and AMI Doduco in 2005 versus 2004.                   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 30, 2005 decreased$1.8 million to $106.8 million from $108.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. As a percentageof net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses was 17.3% in the year ended December 30,2005 versus 19.3% in the comparable period, or a decrease of 2.0% of net sales. Decreased spendingwas a result of decreased variable costs such as selling expense and incentive compensation expense,and fixed costs such as intangible amortization. These expenses were partially offset by increasedresearch, development and engineering expense, the inclusion of FRE for the full year of 2005 andthe inclusion of LK since the time of acquisition in      25       September 2005.  Incentive compensation expense and intangible amortization expense, in particular,were $2.6 million and $2.4 million lower, respectively, in 2005 versus the comparable period in 2004.                   Research, development and engineering expenses are included in selling, general and administrativeexpenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. For the year endedDecember 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004 respectively, RD&E by segment was as follows ( dollars in thousands ):            2005     2004                                Pulse  $   21,359     $   18,420             Percentage of segment sales     5.9  %     5.8  %                                       AMI Doduco  $   4,137     $   4,080             Percentage of segment sales     1.6  %     1.7  %                               Higher RD&E spending in 2005 at Pulse includes additional investments in our China DevelopmentCenter, inclusion of FRE RD&E beginning in September 2004, the inclusion of LK beginning in September2005 and higher U.S. dollar reported spending of RD&E expenses incurred in euros. We believethat future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next-generation products.Design and development activities with our OEM customers continued at an aggressive pace during 2004and into 2005.                    Severance and Asset Impairment Expense.   Total severance and asset impairment expense for the year ended December 30, 2005 increased$25.1 million, to $53.0 million from $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increasein the 2005 period is primarily attributable to $46.0 million of asset impairments related to theConsumer Division.                   In the year ended December 30, 2005, we accrued $7.0 million for a number of actions to streamlineoperations at Pulse and AMI Doduco. These include $4.4 million related to the termination ofmanufacturingand support personnel and $2.6 million to writedown the value of certain fixedassets to theirdisposalvalues. The majority of these accruals were paid by March 31, 2006,except for remaininglease orseverance payments to be made over a specified term. Additionally,we recorded a $46.0million impairmentcharge of Pulse consumer division assets consisting of$25.6 million of goodwill,$11.5 million ofidentifiable intangibles, and $8.9 million of property,plant, and equipment.These impairments resultedfrom updated cash flow projections which reflectthe shift of productionby Pulse to China-basedlocations, decreasing average selling pricesfor television transformersresulting from competitionwith Asian companies selling in U.S. dollars,and the recent weaknessin the European televisionmarket for flyback transformers.                   In the year ended December 31, 2004, we accrued $9.0 million which included severance and related paymentsof $7.5 million to terminate manufacturing and support personnel and $1.5 million to write downthevalue of certain fixed assets to their disposal values. The vast majority of these accrualswereutilized by the end of the second quarter in 2005. Additionally, we recorded an intangibleassetimpairment of $18.9 million related to acquired intangibles. These intangible asset impairmentsresultedfrom updated cash flow projections relating to technology and customer relationships,and reflect,among other things, shifting product mixes, changes among major customers and continuingpressureson selling prices in the consumer and telecommunication product divisions of the Pulse segment.                   Interest .  Net interest income was $1.4 million for the year ended December 30, 2005 compared to net interestexpense of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The higher average balance of investedcash in 2005 over the comparable period in 2004, combined with a higher interest income yield, resultedin higher interest income. Partially offsetting the increase in interest income was an increase ininterest expense related to outstanding borrowings from our credit facility and the inclusion ofFREs interest expense. Recurring aggregate components of interest expense, such as silver leasingfees, interest on bank debt and bank commitment fees, approximated those of 2004.                    Other (Expense) Income.   Other (expense) income was $1.7 million of expense for the year ended December 30, 2005 versus$2.0 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2004. The change is primarily attributableto a gain of $1.1 million related to the settlement of equity rights arising from the 2001 acquisitionof the Engelhard-CLAL electrical contacts business by AMI Doduco during the year ended December 31,2004 and foreign exchange losses were $2.2 million higher in 2005 than in 2004.                   Equity Earnings in Minority-Owned Investments.   Equity earnings in minority-owned investments were $0.8 million for the year ended December31, 2004. Since we acquired control of FRE in September 2004, we consolidate FREs results,and we no longer record equity earnings from FRE. Rather, the full consolidation of FRE and relatedminority interest expense is reflected in our financial statements beginning in the year ended December30, 2005.     26                        Income Taxes.   The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 30, 2005 was (35.5%) compared to 31.3%for the year ended December 31, 2004. The 2005 effective rate is based on a $6.2 million provisionon a $17.3 million loss, versus a $3.5 million provision on $11.3 million profit in 2004. The taxrate in 2005 reflects a higher proportion of income being attributable to high-tax jurisdictions,the impact of non-deductible restructuring expenses in high-tax jurisdictions, a $7.3 million chargerelated to the Section 965 dividend and the tax effects of intangible asset impairments.                   Minority Interest.    Minority interest was $0.9 million of expense for the year ended December 30, 2005 versus$0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Since the date we acquired control of FRE on September13, 2004, we began consolidating FREs results with our own.  Liquidity and Capital Resources                   Working capital as of December 29, 2006 was $189.0 million, compared to $209.8 million as of December30, 2005. This decrease of $20.8 million was primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents,which was partially offset by increases in trade receivables and inventories. Cash and cash equivalents,which are included in working capital, decreased from $173.7 million as of December 30, 2005 to $87.2million as of December 29, 2006 primarily due to acquisition-related uses detailed below. Our workingcapital was impacted by the addition of ERA as of the acquisition date in January 2006.                    We present our statement of cash flows using the indirect method as permitted under Financial AccountingStandards Board Statement No. 95,  Statement of Cash Flows . Our management has found that investors and analysts typically refer to changes in accounts receivable,inventory, and other components of working capital when analyzing operating cash flows. Also, changesin working capital are more directly related to the way we manage our business for cash flow thanare items such as cash receipts from the sale of goods, as would appear using the direct method.                   Net cash provided by operating activities was $78.5 million for the year ended December 29, 2006 and$44.6 million in the comparable period of 2005, an increase of $33.9 million. This increase was primarilyattributable to higher net earnings from continuing operations, excluding intangible asset impairmentsand losses on disposal of fixed assets, if any.                   Capital expenditures were $25.4 million during the year ended December 29, 2006 and $16.3 million inthe comparable period of 2005. The increase of $9.1 million in the 2006 period compared to 2005 wasdue primarily to expenditures at the Pulse antenna and automotive divisions partially offset by lowerexpenditures at FRE. We make capital expenditures to expand production capacity and to improve ouroperating efficiency. We plan to continue making such expenditures in the future as and when necessary.                   We used $91.8 million for acquisitions during the year ended December 29, 2006 and $90.0 million foracquisitions during year ended December 30, 2005, net of cash acquired in both years. The 2006 expendituresrelate to our acquisition of ERA in January 2006, a payment related to our acquisition of LK, additionalinvestments in FRE and to our acquisition of Larsen. The 2005 expenditures related to the acquisitionof LK in September 2005 and an additional investment in FRE. We may acquire other businesses or productlines to expand our breadth and scope of operations.                   We used $14.2 million for dividend payments during the year ended December 29, 2006. On October 31,2006 we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0875 per common share, payable on January 19, 2007to shareholders of record on January 5, 2007. This quarterly dividend will result in a cash paymentto shareholders of approximately $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2007. We paid cash dividendsof $10.6 million during the year ended December 30, 2005. We expect to continue making quarterlydividend payments for the foreseeable future.                   We entered into a credit agreement on October 14, 2005 providing for $200.0 million of credit capacity.The facility consists of an aggregate U.S. dollar-equivalent revolving line of credit in the principalamount of up to $200.0 million, and provides for borrowings in multiple currencies including butnot limited to, U.S. dollars, euros, and Japanese yen, including individual sub-limits of:           a U.S. dollar-based swing-line loan not to exceed $20.0 million;                 a multicurrency facility providing for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount notto exceed the U.S. dollar equivalent of $25.0 million; and            a Singapore sub-facility not to exceed the U.S. dollar equivalent of $50.0 million.                            The credit agreement permits us to request one or more increases in the total commitment not to exceed$100.0 million, provided the minimum increase is $25.0 million, subject to bank approval.     27                        The total amount outstanding under the credit facility may not exceed $200.0 million, provided we donot request an increase in total commitment as noted above.                    Outstanding borrowings are subject to two financial covenants, which are both computed on a rollingtwelve-month basis as of the most recent quarter-end. The first is maximum debt outstanding amountingto three and one-half times our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA),as defined by the credit agreement. The second is maximum debt service expenses amounting to twoand one-half times our cash interest expense, as defined by the credit agreement. The credit agreementalso contains covenants specifying capital expenditure limitations and other customary and normalprovisions. We are in compliance with these covenants as of December 29, 2006.                    As of December 29, 2006, we had $50.6 million of outstanding borrowings under this five-year revolvingcredit agreement, primarily to fund acquisitions. Our total credit available, including standby lettersof credit, as of December 29, 2006 was approximately $148.0 million. Please refer to Note 7 in theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                    We pay a commitment fee on the unborrowed portion of the commitment, which ranges from 0.15% to 0.25%of the total commitment, depending on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined above. The interest ratefor each currencys borrowing will be a combination of the base rate for that currency plusa credit margin spread. The base rate is different for each currency. The credit margin spread isthe same for each currency and is 0.60% to 1.25%, depending on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as definedin the credit agreement. Each of our domestic subsidiaries with net worth equal to or greater than$10 million has guaranteed all obligations incurred under the credit facility.                    Simultaneously with the execution of our current credit agreement, we terminated our previous $125.0million credit agreement, dated June 17, 2004.                   We also have an obligation outstanding due in August 2009 under an unsecured term loan agreement inGermany for the borrowing of approximately 5.1 million euros.                   At December 29, 2006, we included $1.8 million of outstanding debt of Full Rise Electronic Co., Ltd.in connection with our consolidation of FREs financial statements. FRE has a total creditlimitof approximately $3.2 million in U.S. dollar equivalents as of December 29, 2006. NeitherTechnitrol,nor any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, has guaranteed or otherwise participatedor assumed anyresponsibility for the current or future indebtedness of FRE.                   We had four standby letters of credit outstanding at December 29, 2006 in the aggregate amount of $1.4million securing transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business.                   We had commercial commitments outstanding at December 29, 2006 of approximately $135.8 million dueunder precious metal consignment-type leases. This represents an increase of $48.0 million from the$87.8 million outstanding as of December 30, 2005 and is attributable to volume increases and higheraverage silver prices during 2006.                    As of December 29, 2006, future payments related to contractual obligations were as follows ( in thousands ):              Amounts expected to be paid by period              Total     Less than 1 year     1 to 3 years     3 to 5 years     Thereafter                                            Debt  $   59,162     $   1,831     $   6,750     $   50,581     $                Operating leases     31,167        10,131        13,179        3,904        3,953                                            Total  $   90,329     $   11,962     $   19,929     $   54,485     $   3,953                                  We believe that the combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and, if necessary, borrowingsunder our credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements in the foreseeablefuture. In addition, we may use internally generated funds or obtain borrowings or additional equityofferings for acquisitions of suitable businesses or assets. We have not experienced any significantliquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and none are foreseen. However, foreignexchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes whichforeign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash movementsfrom time to time. We expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States because we anticipatethat a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years will be abroad. Wehave not accrued U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on foreign earnings that have been indefinitelyinvested abroad. If these earnings were brought back to the United States, significant tax liabilitiescould be incurred in the United States as several countries in which we operate have tax rates significantlylower than the U.S. statutory rate.      28                       All retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions as of December 29, 2006, with      the exception of approximately $21.4 million of retained earnings primarily in the PRC, that are      restricted in accordance with Section 58 of the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprises Law. Included      in the $21.4 million is $2.2 million of retained earnings of FRE of which we own approximately 71%.      The amount restricted in accordance with the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprise Law is applicable      to all foreign investment enterprises doing business in the PRC. The restriction applies to 10% of    our net earnings in the PRC, limited to 50% of the total capital invested in the PRC.                           In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) was signed into law. The      AJCA contained a series of provisions, several of which are pertinent to us. The AJCA created a temporary      incentive for U.S. multi-national corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing      an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. Based      on this legislation and 2005 guidance by the Department of Treasury, the Company repatriated $52.0      million of foreign earnings, net of $7.3 million of income taxes. Prior to the passage of the AJCA,      the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of approximately $40.0      million, were considered to be indefinitely reinvested, and in accordance with APB Opinion No. 23      (APB 23), Accounting for Income Taxes - Special Areas, no provision for U.S. federal      or state income taxes had been provided on these undistributed earnings. As of December 29, 2006,      the remaining offshore earnings, with the exception of approximately $40.0 million, are intended to      be indefinitely invested abroad and no provision for U.S. federal or state income taxes has been    provided in accordance with APB 23.         New Accounting Pronouncements                          In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158,  Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 123(R)  (SFAS 158). This standard requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income. Additionally,      SFAS 158 requires employers to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end      statement of financial position. The new reporting requirements and related new footnote disclosure      rules of SFAS 158 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. Adoption of the      standard resulted in a decrease in other assets of approximately $0.8 million, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $0.6 million, a decrease in other      long-term liabilities of approximately $2.4 million and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive    income of approximately $1.0 million, net of tax.                       In September 2006,      the FASB issued Statement No. 157,  Fair Value Measurements  (SFAS 157). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair      value in GAAP, and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies when other      accounting pronouncements require fair value measurements; it does not require new fair value measurements.      We are required to adopt this statement starting in 2008 and we are currently evaluating the effect    that SFAS 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements.                          In      July 2006, FASB issued its Interpretation No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,  (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in      an entitys financial statements in accordance with Statement No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes . This interpretation prescribes a minimum recognition threshold (more likely than not or greater than      50 percent) and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken      or expected to be taken on a tax return or otherwise. We are required to adopt this interpretation      in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. We are currently evaluating the requirements of FIN 48    and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.                          In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) SFAS 123(R)-3,  Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-based Payment Awards , that provides an elective alternative transition method of calculating the pool of excess tax benefits      available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) to      the method otherwise required by paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123(R). We have elected to adopt the alternative      method provided in this FASB Staff Position for purposes of calculating the pool of excess tax benefits    available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123(R).                            InDecember 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payment , (SFAS 123(R)), which amends SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.   SFAS 123(R) requires compensation expense to be recognized for all share-based payments madeto employees based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, eliminating the intrinsicvalue alternative allowed by SFAS 123. Generally, the approach to determining fair value under theoriginal pronouncement has not changed, however, there are revisions to the accounting guidelinesestablished, such as accounting for forfeitures. SFAS 123(R) became effective at the beginning ofour fiscal 2006. Adoption of this standard resulted in $0.1 million of income recognized as a cumulativeeffect of accounting change in the year ended December 29, 2006.      29       Item 7a   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   Interest Rate Risk                  Our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt, are exposed tochanges in interest rates in both the U.S. and abroad. We invest our excess cash in short-term, investment-gradeinterest-bearing securities. We generally limit our exposure to any one financial institution tothe extent practical. Our board has adopted policies relating to these risks and continually monitorscompliance with these policies.                  Ourexisting credit facility has variable interest rates. Accordingly, interest expense may increaseif we borrow and if the rates associated with our borrowings move higher. In addition, we may pursueadditional or alternative financing for growth opportunities in one or both segments. We may useinterest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changesin market interest rates. However, we have not used any of these instruments to date.                   The table below presents principal amounts in U.S. dollars (or equivalent U.S. dollars with respectto non-U.S. denominated debt) and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity forour debt obligations. The column captioned Approximate Fair Value sets forth the carryingvalue of our long-term debt as of December 29, 2006. As the majority of our long-term borrowingsare subject to variable interest rates, we estimate that the carrying amount of our variable ratelong-term debt approximates fair value  (dollars   in thousands):          2007      2008      2009     2010      2011     There-       After     Total     Approx.

We conduct business in various foreign currencies, including those of emerging marketcountries in Asia as well as European countries. We may utilize derivative financial instruments,primarily forward exchange contracts in connection with fair value hedges, to manage foreign currencyrisks. In accordance with SFAS 133, gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognizedin income along with adjustments of carrying amounts of the hedged items. Therefore, all of our forwardexchange contracts are marked-to-market, and unrealized gains and losses are included in currentperiod net income. These contracts guarantee a predetermined rate of exchange at the time the contractis purchased. This would allow us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations fromthe date of the contract to a third party for a fee. We believe there could be two potential risksof holding these instruments. The first is that the foreign currency being hedged could move in adirection which could create a better economic outcome than if hedging had not taken place. The secondrisk is that the counterparty to a currency hedge defaults on its obligations. In the past, we reducedthe risk of counterparty default by entering into relatively short-term hedges with well capitalizedand highly rated banks. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts, we would consider theamount of sales and purchases made in local currencies, the type of currency and the costs associatedwith the contracts. As of December 29, 2006, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.However, we did utilize foreign currency forwards during the year ended December 29, 2006.                   The table below provides information about our other non-derivative, non-U.S. dollar denominated financialinstruments and presents the information in equivalent U.S. dollars. Amounts set forth under Liabilitiesrepresent      30       principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our foreign currencydebt obligations. The column captioned Approximate Fair Value sets forth the carryingvalue of our foreign currency long-term debt as of December 29, 2006. As the majority of our long-termborrowings are subject to variable interest rates, we estimate that the carrying amount of our variablerate long-term debt approximates fair value.
