Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results        of Operations  Introduction       This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, as well as other sections of this report, contain certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please refer to pages 10 through 13 of this report for a description of "forward-looking statements" and factors that may affect future results.       We are making the statements below to inform our shareholders of our general financial condition and our results of operations. We are not trying to influence investors to buy or sell our securities.  Business Overview       Please refer to Part I, Item I for a description of our continuing businesses and strategic initiatives.       In June 1997, we sold our Test & Measurement Products Segment, which manufactured material testing systems, force measurement products and weighing devices. We sold these businesses because they did not fit within our core competencies and did not offer us opportunities to create significant shareholder value. The Test & Measurement Products Segment is reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.       We believe that the investments, divestiture and strategies described in Part I, Item I and in the preceding paragraph have positioned us for future growth and the creation of additional shareholder value.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       Working capital at December 31, 1999 was $141.9 million, an increase of $39.5 million from the working capital of $102.3 million at December 31, 1998. Worldwide, cash on hand at December 31, 1999 was $88.2 million, approximately $37.6 million greater than at December 31, 1998. Cash provided by operating activities, supplemented by $4.6 million of net borrowings, was more than adequate to pay for capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividends.       We believe that the combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and, if necessary, additional borrowings under our credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may use internally generated funds and additional borrowings for acquisitions of suitable businesses or assets. At December 31, 1999, we had approximately $146.0 million of unused lines of credit from banks.                                     Page 17 of 61          Cash Flows from Operating Activities       Cash flow from operations was $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $19.5 million from 1998. Net earnings before depreciation and amortization, reductions in net deferred tax assets and inventory and an increase in accounts payable contributed to cash provided by operations. Offsetting these favorable cash flow factors were an increase in accounts receivable due to record sales levels contributed by the ECS during the fourth quarter of 1999 and a decrease in accured expenses due to payments for income taxes and for acquisition related transaction and integration expenses.       Cash Flows from Investing Activities       Cash used by investing activities was $32.9 million during 1999. We used approximately $15.3 million of cash to pay for acquisitions and $18.8 million to pay for capital expenditures.       Cash payments for capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, represented approximately 3.5% of net sales during 1999 and exceeded overall depreciation by about $3.1 million. We make capital expenditures to expand production capacity and to improve our operating efficiency. We expect to continue making such expenditures.       With the exception of approximately $7.2 million of retained earnings in China which are restricted by PRC regulations, substantially all retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions. We have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and none are foreseen. However, foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which some foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash movements from time to time. The retained earnings in other countries represent a material portion of our assets. We expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years will be abroad. If such earnings were brought back to the United States, significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the United States. This could have a material unfavorable impact on our net income and cash position.       Cash Flows from Financing Activities       During 1999, we borrowed approximately $77.8 million and repaid approximately $73.2 million of debt. We entered into two DM10.0 million unsecured loan facilities in Germany in order to convert a portion of our outstanding credit from a variable-rate revolver to a fixed-rate term debt. One facility is due in July 2003 and bears interest at a rate of 4.85%. The second facility terminates in August 2009 and bears interest at 5.65%. In addition, we entered into an additional variable-rate Eurocurrency revolving credit facility. This facility has a maximum draw of $20.0 million and is due in June 2001. We used the proceeds of the additional debt instruments to finance acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures.                                     Page 18 of 61         We have paid dividends for the last 95 consecutive quarters. Dividends paid in 1999 were $4.1 million compared to $3.8 million in 1998. We expect to continue making quarterly dividend payments for the foreseeable future.       Foreign Currency Effects       During 1999, the Euro devalued approximately 14% relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we incurred foreign currency losses at our ECS European operations, as Euro denominated net assets were translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we experienced a negative translation adjustment to equity as our investment in the MCS's European operations became worth less in U.S. dollars than it was prior to the devaluation of the Euro. This U.S. dollar decrease in investment value for 1999 resulted in a reduction in equity of approximately $1.8 million.       During 1998, we did not experience any significant foreign currency gains or losses but had a positive adjustment to equity as a result of strengthening of the Deutsche mark and the French franc during the second half of 1998.       During 1997, currencies of several of the Asian countries in which we manufacture and/or sell products devalued significantly relative to the U.S. dollar. The majority of our sales originating in those countries, as well as the majority of raw material purchased, are denominated in U.S. dollars. Expenses in those countries, particularly labor and overhead, are denominated and paid in local currencies which devalued against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the devaluation of these local currencies favorably affected our profitability by reducing the manufacturing costs incurred in those countries.       We transact a significant amount of sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, changing exchange rates often impact our financial results. This is particularly true of movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro because AMI Doduco's European sales are denominated primarily in Euro currencies. In the future, it is possible that an increasing percentage of our sales will be denominated in non-U.S. currencies. This would increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.       Please see the section titled "Foreign Currency Risk" under Item 7a of this report for a description of our strategies to manage foreign currency risks.  New Accounting Pronouncements       In June of 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. This standard is effective for quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our operating results or liquidity. The impact of this standard on our balance sheet will depend on the amount of hedging activity outstanding on the date of adoption.

We attribute the 1999 sales increase to:       o strong demand, particularly in the second half of 1999, in the ECS for        local area networking, telecommunication and power conversion products;        and       o a full year of operating contributions by our 1998 acquisitions -        Metales, FEE and GTI.  Partially offsetting these positive sales factors was a decrease in sales contributed by the MCS' European operations.       Our 1999 ECS sales increased $88.5 million, or 40.4%, from the prior year. As previously noted, we experienced strong demand for our products during the second half of the year. In addition, our 1999 results include a full year of FEE and GTI contributions. Our 1998 results included operating FEE for approximately six months and GTI for approximately six weeks.       Sales in the MCS decreased by $6.6 million, or 2.9%, from 1998 to 1999. The MCS sales in 1999 were affected by:  - ---------------  (1) The results of the Test & Measurement Products Segment are reported as      discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. The 1997      sales of the Test & Measurement Products Segment were approximately $11.8      million prior to the divestiture on June 4, 1997.                                     Page 20 of 61        o generally weaker European electric power, industrial machinery and        durable goods markets;       o an average Deutsche mark-to-dollar exchange rate that was approximately        4.5% below the 1998 average; and       o the phase-out of certain non-core product lines.  During the latter part of 1999, we began to see a recovery in the European markets as domestic demand strengthened and exports to Asia rebounded. In addition, our 1999 sales into North American markets increased from 1998.       The increase in consolidated sales from 1997 to 1998 resulted from a full year of operating the magnetic components business purchased from Nortel in late 1997, partial-year sales contributed by our 1998 acquisitions and strong sales volume from the MCS's European operations.       Cost of Sales       Gross margin for 1999 was 32.4% of sales. The comparable amounts for 1998 and 1997 are 31.7% and 32.2%, respectively. Although the gross margin for both the ECS and the MCS were lower when compared to the prior year, on a consolidated basis the margin was higher as we realized proportionately more higher-margin ECS sales than MCS sales.       The margin for the ECS decreased from the prior year as a result of the ECS's 1998 acquisitions and continuing pricing pressures from ECS customers. The FEE and Valor businesses acquired by the ECS in 1998 operated at lower margins than the previously existing ECS business. In addition, expenses were incurred related to the FEE and Valor integration efforts. Partially offsetting these factors in the second half of 1999 was the positive impact on margins of volume efficiencies and the cost control programs instituted in the first quarter of 1999.       The MCS gross margin decreased slightly from the prior year as cost reduction efforts were more than offset by weakness in the European markets, which caused our fixed costs to be allocated over less volume, and higher sales of precious metals on which we realize very low margins. We assume little to no price risk on sales of precious metals. Our cost reduction efforts continue into 2000 in both the manufacturing and administrative areas. We are evaluating additional ways to reduce the cost structure of the MCS and improve its operating performance.       The decrease in gross margin from 1997 to 1998 was due to a slower LAN market in 1998 when compared to 1997 and the acquisition by the ECS of businesses operating at lower margins than our previously existing business.                                     Page 21 of 61         Operating Expenses       Our total selling, general and administrative expenses for 1999, 1998 and 1997 are as follows. Amounts are in thousands:                                                        Year Ended                                                      December 31,                                          1999            1998             1997                                          ----            ----             ----      Selling, general &        administrative expenses         $110,694         $88,827         $82,264       Percentage of net sales              20.9%           19.8%           20.7%       Selling, general and administrative expense increased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales in 1999 as compared to 1998. The increases result from:       o higher spending required to support the higher level of ECS sales;       o significantly higher expenses incurred in 1999 associated with        implementing and optimizing a global ERP system within the MCS;       o costs associated with integrating our most recent acquisitions into the        Company;       o costs associated with reorganizing the MCS business; and       o expenses related to acquisition development activity, particularly within        the MCS.  Partially offsetting these factors was the cost reduction program instituted in both segments in the first quarter of 1999.       The increase in total selling, general and administrative expenses from 1997 to 1998 resulted from increased spending to support more sales volume. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expense decreased from 1997 to 1998 due to the absence of Netwave Technologies, Inc. Netwave was a wireless local area network product line which we sold at the end of 1997. Netwave required a high level of spending relative to its revenues. In 1998, expenses related to integrating acquisitions partially offset the benefit of divesting Netwave.                                      Page 22 of 61         We include research, development and engineering expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. RD&E by segment for the past three years is as follows. Amounts are in thousands:                                                       Year Ended                                                     December 31,                                           1999            1998            1997                                           ----            ----            ----       ECS                                $13,972         $11,085         $10,560      Percentage of segment sales           4.6%            5.1%            5.9%       MCS                                $ 5,639        $  5,755        $  5,807      Percentage of segment sales           2.5%            2.5%            2.7%       RD&E spending within the ECS increased from 1998 as the ECS continues to invest in new technologies and related improvements to respond to technology changes in its marketplace. As a percentage of sales, the ECS spending is less than the prior year as the ECS sales reached record levels in 1999. Although the ECS spending in dollars on RD&E increased only slightly from 1997 to 1998, the 1997 amount included RD&E at Netwave. Excluding Netwave's high RD&E expenses in relation to its sales, the ECS spending on RD&E increased significantly from 1997.       Neither segment anticipates any significant changes to RD&E efforts in the near-term.       Interest       Interest income for 1999 was $1.9 million compared with $2.1 million in 1998 and $2.5 million in 1997. Although cash and cash equivalents were substantially higher at December 31, 1999 than December 31, 1998, the majority of the increase in cash was generated during the latter part of 1999.       For 1999, interest expense was $3.5 million as compared with $3.3 million during 1998 and $2.4 million for 1997. The slight increase in interest expense resulted from higher debt levels in 1999 than 1998, particularly in the early part of 1999 as we used debt to partially finance our November 1998 acquisition of GTI/Valor. Partially offsetting the effect of higher debt levels in 1999 was more favorable interest rates on our European debt facilities.       Please see the section titled "Interest Rate Risk" under Item 7a of this report for additional information regarding interest.                                     Page 23 of 61         Income Taxes       Our effective income tax rate during 1999 was 24.9%. This compares to 36.4% in 1998 and 37.8% in 1997. The substantial decrease in our effective tax rate resulted from actions initiated in the first quarter of 1999 related to a comprehensive global review of our business operations. This comprehensive review was aimed at ensuring that our overall tax rates are optimal and appropriate. Also contributing to the lower overall tax rate was a decline in the proportion of taxable income attributable to high-tax jurisdictions such as Germany.       We have benefited over recent years from favorable offshore tax treatments; however, there are no assurances that such treatments will continue in the future. Developing countries and, in particular, the People's Republic of China, may change their tax policies at any time. In addition to income tax policies, we monitor developments relating to other business taxes.  Other Issues       Precious Metal       The MCS uses silver as well as other precious metals in the manufacturing of electrical contacts, rivets and other products. Historically, we have leased or held the majority of these materials through consignment arrangements with our suppliers. Leasing and consignment costs have been substantially below the costs to borrow funds to purchase the metals. In addition, the risk of a decrease in the market price of owned precious metal can be substantial. As is sometimes the case, during the first quarter of 1998, and to a lesser extent in early 1999, the price of silver increased significantly. The associated leasing costs also increased. The terms of sale within the MCS allow us to charge customers for the current market value of silver. However, leasing costs cannot always be recovered. Thus far we have been successful in managing the costs associated with our precious metals. While limited amounts were purchased during 1999 for use in production, the vast majority of our precious metal inventory continues to be leased or held on consignment. If our leasing/consignment fees increase significantly in a short period of time, and we are unable to recover these increased costs through higher sale prices, a negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity may result. We believe this risk is shared by our competitors.                                    Page 24 of 61        Year 2000       The popularly called "Year 2000" issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems revolved around whether computer systems would properly recognize date-sensitive information when the year changed to 2000. Information technology ("IT") and non-IT systems that did not properly recognize such information could have generated erroneous data or caused a system to fail.       We substantially completed the required modifications to our IT and non-IT systems. Since the inception of our efforts to address potential Year 2000 issues, we incurred approximately $.5 million of Year 2000 remediation expenses related to our systems. These costs were expensed as SG&A as incurred. In addition, we incurred costs to install new software. These costs have been capitalized and will be amortized over the expected useful life of the related software.       Following the arrival of the Year 2000, we have not experienced any significant problems related to Year 2000 issues. We have built and delivered product and transacted business with our customers and suppliers without interruption. In addition, we have not received any notifications from customers regarding Year 2000 issues related to product sold. We will, however, continue to monitor our computer systems to ensure any latent Year 2000 issues that may arise are addressed promptly.       Euro Conversion       On January 1, 1999, 11 of the 15 member countries of the European Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the Euro. We refer to the 11 countries as the participating countries and the participating countries' sovereign currencies as the legacy currencies. The Euro now trades on currency exchanges and is available for non-cash transactions.       The legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the Euro between January 1, 1999 and July 1, 2002. During this transition period, public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the Euro or a legacy currency. Beginning January 1, 2002, the participating countries will issue new Euro-denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions. By July 1, 2002, the participating countries will withdraw all bills and coins denominated in the legacy currencies, so that the legacy currencies no longer will be legal tender for any transactions. The conversion to the Euro will then be complete.                                     Page 25 of 61        We have developed plans to ensure, to the extent possible, our operations will not be negatively impacted by the Euro. On a company-wide basis, those efforts have been coordinated by the corporate Treasurer and have included internal personnel as well as external consultants. The ECS is continually evaluating the impact of the Euro on the operations located in Europe. The MCS is in the renovation and implementation stages of addressing Euro conversion related system issues so that optimal customer services relating to Euro transactions can be provided to its European customers.       As of December 31, 1999, no significant problems related to Euro conversion issues have occurred. The failure to correct a material Euro conversion issue could result in an interruption in, or failure of, certain normal business activities. Such failures could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.   Item 7a Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk       Our financial instruments exposed to changes in interest rates are long-term debt obligations. We invest our excess cash with high-credit-rated financial institutions. We limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extent practical. Our board has adopted policies relating to these risks and the audit committee of the board continually monitors compliance with these policies.       The majority of our credit facilities have variable interest rates. Accordingly, interest expense may increase if the rates associated with, or the amount of, our borrowings move higher. In addition, we may pursue additional or alternative financing for growth opportunities in one or both segments. We may use interest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates. However, we have not used any of these instruments to date.                                      Page 26 of 61         The table below presents principal amounts in equivalent U.S. dollars and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its fair value after taking into consideration current rates offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.

In order to reduce our exposure resulting from currency fluctuations, we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts and/or currency options. These contracts guarantee a predetermined range of exchange rates at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts and currency options, we consider the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies, the type of currency, and the costs associated with the contracts. At December 31, 1999, the Company did not have any currency exchange forward contracts or currency options outstanding.
