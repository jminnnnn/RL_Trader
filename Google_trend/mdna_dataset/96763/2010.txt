Item 7       Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations    Introduction   Thisdiscussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations aswell as other sections of this report contain certain “forward-lookingstatements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Actof 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results maydiffer materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements formany reasons, including the risks faced by us described in the “Risk Factors”section of this report on pages 7 through 15.   Overview   Weoperate our continuing operations in one segment, our Electronic ComponentsGroup, which we refer to as Electronics and is known as Pulse in itsmarkets.  Electronics is a world-wide producer of precision-engineeredelectronic components and modules. We believe we are a leading global producerof these products in the primary markets we serve based on our estimates of theannual revenues of our primary markets and our share of those markets relativeto our competitors.   We havethree primary product groups. Our network group includes the production of ourconnectors, filters, chokes and other magnetic components. Our wireless groupproduces our handset antenna products, our non-cellular wireless and automotiveantenna products and our mobile speakers and receivers.  Our powergroup includes our power and signal transformers, automotive coils and militaryand aerospace products and other power magneticsproducts.    Net sales for our primary product groups forthe years ended December 25, 2009, December 26, 2008 and December 27, 2007 wereas follows  (inmillions) :                   2009          2008          2007        Network      $  152.7        $  216.0        $  226.4       Wireless         151.0           263.3           277.9       Power         95.1           147.0           167.3       Net      sales      $  398.8        $  626.3        $  671.6        General .  We definenet sales as gross sales less returns and allowances. We sometimes refer to netsales as revenue.   Historically,our gross margin has been significantly affected by acquisitions, product mixand capacity utilization.  Our markets are characterized by relativelyshort product life cycles.  As a result, significant product turnoveroccurs each year and, subsequently, there are frequent variations in the pricesof products sold.  Due to the constantly changing quantity of parts weoffer and frequent changes in our average selling prices, we cannot isolate theimpact of changes in unit volume and unit prices on our net sales and grossmargin in any given period.  Changes in foreign exchange rates,especially the U.S. dollar to the euro and the U.S. dollar to the Chineserenminbi also affect U.S. dollar reported sales.   Webelieve our focus on acquisitions, technology and cost reduction programsprovides us opportunities for future growth in net sales and operatingprofit.  However, unfavorable economic and market conditions mayresult in a reduction in demand for our products, thus, negatively impacting ourfinancial performance.   Acquisitions .  Acquisitionshave been an important part of our growth strategy.  In many cases,our moves into new product lines and extensions of our existing product lines ormarkets have been facilitated by acquisitions. Our acquisitions continuallychange our product mix and broaden our product offerings in new or existingmarkets.  We may pursue additional acquisition opportunities in thefuture.   Technology .  Ourproducts must evolve along with changes in technology, availability and price ofraw materials and design preferences of the end users of our products. Also,regulatory requirements occasionally impact the design and functionality of ourproducts. We address these conditions, as well as our customers’ demands, bycontinuing to invest in product development and by maintaining a diverse productportfolio which contains both mature and emerging technologies.        19         ManagementFocus .  Our executives focus on a number of important metricsto evaluate our financial condition and operating performance.  Forexample, we use revenue growth, gross profit as a percentage of revenue,operating profit as a percentage of revenue and economic profit as performancemeasures.  We define economic profit as after-tax operating profitless our cost of capital.  Operating leverage, or incrementaloperating profit as a percentage of incremental sales, is also reviewed, as thisreflects the benefit of absorbing fixed overhead and operatingexpenses.  In evaluating working capital management, liquidity andcash flow, our executives also use performance measures such as free cash flow,days sales outstanding, days payables outstanding, inventory turnover,debt-to-EBITDA leverage and cash conversion efficiency.  We definefree cash flow as cash flow from operations less capitalspending.  Additionally, as the continued success of our business islargely dependent on meeting and exceeding customers’ expectations,non-financial performance measures relating to product development, on-timedelivery and quality assist our management in monitoring customer satisfactionon an on-going basis.   Cost ReductionPrograms .  As a result of our focus on both economic andoperating profit, we continue to aggressively size our operations so thatcapacity is optimally matched to current and anticipated future revenues andunit demand. Future expenses associated with these programs will depend onspecific actions taken.  Actions taken over the past several yearssuch as divestitures, plant closures, plant relocations, asset impairments andreduction in personnel at certain locations have resulted in the elimination ofa variety of costs.  The majority of the non-impairment related coststhat were eliminated represent the annual salaries and benefits of terminatedemployees, including both those related to manufacturing and those providingselling, general and administrative services. Also, we’ve had depreciationsavings from disposed equipment and a reduction in rental expense from thetermination of lease agreements.  We have also reduced overhead costsas a result of relocating factories to lower-cost locations.  Savingsfrom these actions will impact cost of goods sold and selling, general andadministrative expenses.  However, the timing of such savings may notbe apparent due to many factors such as unanticipated changes in demand, changesin unit selling prices, operational challenges or changes in operatingstrategies.   Duringthe year ended December 25, 2009, we determined that approximately $71.0 millionof our wireless group’s goodwill was impaired.  Refer to Note 5 forfurther details.  Additionally, we incurred a charge of $11.9 millionfor a number of cost reduction actions.  These charges includeseverance and related payments of $3.0 million and fixed asset impairments of$8.9 million.  The impaired assets include production lines associatedwith products that have no expected future demand and two real estate propertieswhich were disposed.   Duringthe year ended December 26, 2008, we determined that $310.4 million of goodwilland other intangibles were impaired, including $170.3 million of goodwill andidentifiable intangibles of a discontinued operation.  Additionally,we incurred a charge of $13.2 million for a number of cost reductionactions.  These charges include severance and related payments andother associated costs of $5.5 million resulting from the termination ofmanufacturing and support personnel at our operations primarily in Asia, Europeand North America and $4.1 million of other costs primarily resulting from thetransfer of manufacturing operations from Europe and North Africa toAsia.  Additionally, we recorded fixed asset impairments of $3.6million.   Duringthe year ended December 28, 2007, we incurred a charge of $17.6 million for anumber of cost reduction actions.  These charges include severance andrelated payments of $10.6 million resulting from the termination ofmanufacturing and support personnel at our operations in Asia, Europe and NorthAmerica and $5.5 million for the write down of certain fixed assets to theirdisposal values.  Additionally, we incurred approximately $1.5 millionof other plant closure, relocation and similar costs associated with theseactions.   Divestitures.  We engage indivestitures to streamline our operations, focus on our core businesses, reducedebt and strengthen our financial position.  In February 2009, weannounced our intention to explore monetization alternatives with respect to ourElectrical segment, a producer of a full array of precious metal electricalcontact products that range from materials used in the fabrication of electricalcontacts to completed contact subassemblies.  During the second quarter of2009, we determined that Electrical met the qualifications to be reported as adiscontinued operation in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for allperiods presented.  In addition, the assets and liabilities ofElectrical are considered held for sale and reported as current on our December25, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet. On January 4, 2010, we completed the saleof Electrical’s North American business for an amount immaterial to ourConsolidated Financial Statements.   We expect the disposition ofthe remaining Electrical business to be completed by the end of June2010.  On June 25, 2009, we divested Electronics’ Medtech componentsbusiness for approximately $201.4 million. These proceeds were subject to finalworking capital and financial indebtedness adjustments which were finalized inearly January, 2010 for a payment immaterial to our Consolidated FinancialStatements.  All open customer orders were transferred at the date ofsale. Also, in April 2009, we divested our non-core MEMS business for an amountimmaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have had no materialcontinuing involvement with the operations of Medtech or MEMS after eachrespective sale.        20         International Operations . AtDecember 25, 2009, we had manufacturing operations in five countries, three ofwhich are only engaged in operations which we are in the process ofdivesting.   We produce a majority of our products in China andsell the majority of these products to customers in China and other countries inAsia.   Our net sales are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars,euros and Chinese renminbi.  Changing exchange rates often impact ourfinancial results and our period-over-period comparisons.  This isparticularly true of movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar andthe renminbi and the U.S. dollar and the euro and each of these and otherforeign currencies relative to each other.  Sales and net earningsdenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar may result in higher orlower dollar sales and net earnings upon translation for our U.S. dollardenominated Consolidated Financial Statements.  Certain divisions ofour wireless and power groups’ sales are denominated primarily in euros andrenminbi.  Net earnings may also be affected by the mix of sales andexpenses by currency within each group. We may also experience a positive ornegative translation adjustment to equity because our investments in non-U.S.dollar-functional subsidiaries may translate to more or less U.S. dollars in ourU.S. Consolidated Financial Statements.  Foreign currency gains orlosses may also be incurred when non-functional currency denominatedtransactions are remeasured to an operation’s functional currency for financialreporting purposes. If a higher percentage of our transactions are denominatedin non-U.S. currencies, increased exposure to currency fluctuations mayresult.   In orderto reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations, we may purchase currencyexchange forward contracts and/or currency options. These contracts guarantee apredetermined exchange rate or range of rates at the time the contract ispurchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currencyfluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for afee.  In determining the use of forward exchange contracts andcurrency options, we consider the amount of sales, purchases and net assets orliabilities denominated in local currencies, the currency to be hedged and thecosts associated with the contracts.  At December 25, 2009, we hadseven foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forwardapproximately 7.0 million euro, or approximately $10.1 million, to receiveChinese renminbi.   The fair value of these forward contracts wasa liability of $0.2 million as determined through use of Level 2 fair valueinputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy of Topic 815 in the FinancialAccounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification(“ASC”).  These contracts are used to mitigate the risk of currencyfluctuations at our Chinese operations.  At December 26, 2008, we hadtwelve foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forwardapproximately $12.0 million U.S. dollars to receive Danish krone, and eightforeign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately 8.0million euro, or approximately $11.3 million, to receive Chineserenminbi.  The fair value of these forward contracts was an asset of$0.1 million as determined through use of Level 2 inputs.   Precious Metals.  Electrical,the segment we are currently in the process of divesting, uses silver and otherprecious metals in manufacturing most of its electrical contacts, contactmaterials and contact subassemblies. Historically, Electrical has leased or heldthese materials through consignment-type arrangements with its suppliers, exceptin China where such leasing arrangements are prohibited. Leasing and consignmentcosts have typically been lower than the costs to borrow funds to purchase themetals and, more importantly, these arrangements eliminate the effects offluctuations in the market price of owned precious metal and enable Electricalto minimize its inventories. Electrical’s terms of sale generally allow it tocharge customers for precious metal content based on the market value ofprecious metal on the day after shipment to the customer.  Suppliersinvoice Electrical based on the market value of the precious metal on the dayafter shipment to the customer as well.  Thus far, Electrical has beensuccessful in managing the costs associated with its precious metals. Whilelimited amounts are purchased for use in production, the majority of preciousmetal inventory continues to be leased or held on consignment. If leasing orconsignment costs increase significantly in a short period of time, andElectrical is unable to recover these increased costs through higher salesprices, a negative impact on Electrical’s results of operations and liquiditymay result. Leasing and consignment fee increases are caused primarily byincreases in interest rates or volatility in the price of the consignedmaterial.  Similarly, if Electrical is unable to maintain thenecessary bank commitments and credit limits necessary for its precious metalleasing and consignment facilities, or obtain alternative facilities on a timelybasis, Electrical may be required to finance the direct purchase of preciousmetals, reduce its production volume or take other actions that could negativelyimpact its financial condition and results of operations.   Income Taxes . Our effectiveincome tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in high-taxjurisdictions, such as those in Europe and the U.S. and income earned in low-taxjurisdictions, such as Hong Kong and the PRC.  This mix of income canvary significantly from one period to another. Additionally, our effectiveincome tax rate will be impacted from period to period by significanttransactions and the deductibility of severance, impairment, financing and othercosts.  We have benefited over the years from favorable tax incentivesand other tax policies, however, there is no guarantee as to how long thesebenefits will continue to exist.  Also, changes in operations, taxlegislation, estimates, judgments and forecasts may affect our tax rate fromperiod to period.   Except inlimited circumstances, we have not provided for U.S. income and foreignwithholding taxes on our non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings. Suchearnings may include our pre-acquisition earnings of foreign entities acquiredthrough stock purchases, which, with the exception of approximately $40.0million, are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S.indefinitely.        21         CriticalAccounting Policies   Thepreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity withU.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments,assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidatedfinancial statements and accompanying notes.  Note 1 to theConsolidated Financial Statements on pages 48 through 52 describes thesignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of theConsolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to,the accounting for inventory, divestiture accounting, purchase accounting,goodwill and identifiable intangibles, income taxes, defined benefit plans,contingency accruals and severance and asset impairment. Actual results coulddiffer from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies aresubject to review by our Audit Committee of our Board of Directors are impactedsignificantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation ofour Consolidated Financial Statements.   Inventory Valuation.  We carryour inventories at lower of cost or market.  We establish inventoryprovisions to write down excess and obsolete inventory to marketvalue.  We utilize historical trends and customer forecasts toestimate expected usage of on-hand inventory.  The establishment ofinventory provisions requires judgments and estimates which may change over timeand may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates.However, we do not believe that a reasonable change in these assumptions wouldresult in a material impact to our financial statements.  In addition,inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts estimated by takinginto account actual sales of our products over recent historical periods andcustomer forecasts.  If there is a sudden and significant decrease indemand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescencebecause of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements, we may berequired to write down our inventory and our gross margin could be negativelyaffected.  However, if we were to sell or use a significant portion ofinventory already written down, our gross margin could be positivelyaffected.  Inventory provisions at December 25, 2009 were $5.7 millionand at December 26, 2008 were $15.4 million, including approximately $8.1million at our Medtech and Electrical discontinued operations.   DivestitureAccounting .  We have divested certain components of ourbusiness.  When this occurs, we report the component that either hasbeen disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, as a discontinued operationwhen the operations and cash flows of the component have been (or will be)eliminated from our ongoing operations and when we do not expect to have anysignificant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after thedisposal transaction.  If we plan to dispose of the component by sale,we would be required to report the component at the lower of its carrying amountor at fair value less costs to sell in the period which the component isclassified as held for sale.  These assessments require judgments andestimates which include determining when it is appropriate to classify thecomponent as held for sale, if the component meets the specifications of adiscontinued operation, the fair value of the component and the level and typeof involvement, if any, we will have in the disposed component in thefuture.   Furthermore, when removing the component from ourConsolidated Balance Sheets and in restating results for prior period, we arerequired to make assumptions, judgments and estimates regarding, among otherthings, the assets, liabilities and activities of the component and theirrelation to our continuing businesses.   PurchaseAccounting .  The purchase price of an acquired business isallocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired andliabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values, with theexcess recorded as goodwill.  Such fair market value assessmentsrequire judgments and estimates which may change over time and may cause finalamounts to differ materially from original estimates.  Adjustments tofair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase priceallocation period which cannot exceed twelve months.   Goodwill and IdentifiableIntangibles .  We perform an annual review of goodwill in ourfourth fiscal quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of apotential impairment exist, to determine if the carrying amount of the recordedgoodwill is impaired.    The impairment reviewprocess compares the fair value of each reporting unit where goodwill resideswith its carrying value.  If the net book value of the reporting unitexceeds its fair value, we would perform the second step of the impairment testwhich requires allocation of the reporting unit’s fair value to all of itsassets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, withany residual fair value being allocated to goodwill.  An impairmentcharge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit’sgoodwill is less than its carrying amount.  We have identified threereporting units, which are our Legacy Electronics unit, including our power andnetwork groups but excluding a component of our connector group known as FRE,our wireless group and FRE.   Ourimpairment review incorporates both an income and comparable-companies marketapproach to estimate potential impairment.  We believe the use ofmultiple valuation techniques results in a more accurate indicator of the fairvalue of each reporting unit, rather than only using an incomeapproach.        22         Theincome approach is based on estimating future cash flows using various growthassumptions and discounting based on a present value factor. We develop thefuture net cash flows during our annual budget process, which is completed inour fourth fiscal quarter each year or more frequently if we believe a potentialimpairment exists. The growth rates we use are an estimate of the future growthin the industries in which we participate. Our discount rate assumption is basedon an estimated cost of capital, which we determine annually based on ourestimated costs of debt and equity relative to our capital structure. Thecomparable-companies market approach considers the trading multiples of our peercompanies to compute our estimated fair value. The majority of thecomparable-companies utilized in our evaluation are included in the Dow JonesU.S. Electrical Components and Equipment Industry Group Index.   Ourannual review of goodwill was performed in the fourth quarter of 2009. Step oneof the analysis yielded no impairment as the estimated fair value of eachreporting unit where goodwill has been allocated substantially exceeded itscarrying value.   Weperformed step one of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of2009 as a result of the decline in our forecasted operating profit. Our wirelessgroup did not pass the first step of the impairment test. The second step of theimpairment test yielded a $71.0 million goodwill impairment at our wirelessgroup. In addition to the 2009 impairment, our annual review in 2008 resulted ina pre-tax goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment of$254.7 million. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements foradditional details.   Thedetermination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation ofthat value to the individual assets and liabilities within those reporting unitsrequires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates andassumptions include, but are not limited to, the selection of the appropriatediscount rate, terminal growth rates, forecasted net cash flows, appropriatepeer group companies and control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in theindustries in which we compete. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved inmaking these estimates, actual findings could differ from those estimates.Changes in assumptions concerning projected financial results or any of theother underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on either the fairvalue of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.Additionally, significant changes in any of these estimates or assumptions inthe future may result in a future impairment. Changes in key assumptions wouldaffect the 2009 and 2008 recognized goodwill impairments as follows ( in millions, except assumptionpercentages ):       2009 Impairment                Increase      100          Decrease      100                    Assumption          Basis  Points          Basis  Points                                             Discount      rate         22.5  %     $  2.9        $  (3.0  )    Terminal      growth rate         3.0  %     $  (1.7  )     $  1.8       Control      premium         25.0  %     $  (0.4  )     $  0.5            2008 Impairment                Increase      100          Decrease      100                    Assumption          Basis   Points          Basis  Points                                             Discount      rate         21.5  %     $  8.1        $  (8.9  )    Terminal      growth rate         3.0  %     $  (4.9  )     $  4.5       Control      premium         25.0  %     $  (0.8  )     $  0.8        We alsoassess the impairment of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibleassets subject to amortization and property, plant and equipment, wheneverevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not berecoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairmentreview include significant changes in the use of any asset, changes inhistorical trends in operating performance, changes in projected operatingperformance, stock price, failure to pass step one of our annual goodwillimpairment test and significant negative economic trends. We performed arecoverability test on certain definite and indefinite-lived intangible assetsin the first quarter of 2009 that yielded no impairment of identifiableintangible assets. During our annual review in 2008, we also reviewed ourintangible assets for impairment, which resulted in a pre-tax finite-livedintangible impairment of $55.7 million. Refer to Note 5 of the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements for additional details.   Assigninguseful lives and periodically reassessing useful lives of intangible assets ispredicated on various assumptions. Also, the fair values of our intangibleassets are impacted by factors such as changing technology, declines in demandthat lead to excess capacity and other factors. In addition to the variousassumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above, we may strategicallyrealign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwiseexiting businesses in response to changes in industry or market conditions,which may result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangibles. While webelieve the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value ofgoodwill and identifiable assets are reasonable, a change in those assumptionscould affect their valuation.        23         Income Taxes.  We use theasset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under thismethod, income tax expense/benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payableor refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assetsfor the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in anentity’s financial statements or tax returns.  We must makeassumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision forincome taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuationallowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our judgments,assumptions and estimates relative to the provision for income tax take intoaccount current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possibleoutcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic taxauthorities.  Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws andthe resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact theamounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financialstatements.  Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to thevalue of a deferred tax asset also take into account predictions of the amountand category of future taxable income.  Actual operating results andthe underlying amount and category of income in future years could render ourcurrent assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxesinaccurate.  Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentionedabove could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from ourestimates.   Inaccordance with the recognition standards established, we perform acomprehensive review of uncertain tax positions regularly.  In thisregard, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a taxposition taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future taxreturn or claim, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense forfinancial reporting purposes.  Until these positions are sustained bythe taxing authorities, or the statutes of limitations otherwise expire, we havebenefits resulting from such positions and report the tax effects as a liabilityfor uncertain tax positions in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Defined BenefitPlans.   The costs and obligations of our defined benefit plansare dependent on actuarial assumptions.  The three most criticalassumptions used, which impact the net periodic pension expense (income) and thebenefit obligation, are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets andrate of compensation increase.  The discount rate is determined basedon high-quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expectedbenefit payments.  For our pension obligations in the United States, ayield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debtsecurities with varying maturities is used to discount each future year’sexpected benefit payments to their present value.  This generates ourdiscount rate assumption for our domestic pension plans.  For ourforeign plans, we use market rates for high quality corporate bonds to deriveour discount rate assumption.  The expected return on plan assetsrepresents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on thepension assets.  We have estimated this rate based on historicalreturns of similarly diversified portfolios.  The rate of compensationincrease represents the long-term assumption for expected increases to salariesfor pay-related plans.  These key assumptions are evaluatedannually.  Changes in these assumptions can result in differentexpense and liability amounts, as well as a change in future contributions tothe plans.  However, we do not believe that a reasonable change inthese assumptions would result in a material impact to our financialstatements.  Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statementsfor further details of the primary assumptions used in determining the cost andobligations of our defined benefit plans.   ContingencyAccruals.   During the normal course of business, a variety ofissues may arise, which may result in litigation, environmental compliance andother contingent obligations.  In developing our contingency accrualswe consider both the likelihood of a loss or incurrence of a liability as wellas our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of exposure.  Werecord contingency accruals when a liability is probable and the amount can bereasonably estimated.  We periodically evaluate available informationto assess whether contingency accruals should be adjusted.  Ourevaluation includes an assessment of legal interpretations, judicialproceedings, recent case law and specific changes or developments regardingknown claims.  We could be required to record additional expenses infuture periods if our initial estimates were too low, or reverse part of thecharges that we recorded initially if our estimates were toohigh.  Additionally, litigation costs incurred in connection with acontingency are expensed as incurred.   Severance, Impairment and OtherAssociated Costs.   We record severance, tangible assetimpairments and other restructuring charges, such as lease terminations, inresponse to declines in demand that lead to excess capacity, changing technologyand other factors.  These costs, which we refer to as restructuringcosts, are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incurthose costs, and all of the requirements for accrual are met in accordance withthe applicable accounting guidance.  Restructuring costs are recordedbased upon our best estimates at the time the action isinitiated.  Our actual expenditures for the restructuring activitiesmay differ from the initially recorded costs.  If this occurs, wecould be required either to record additional expenses in future periods if ourinitial estimates were too low, or reverse part of the initial charges if ourinitial estimates were too high.  In the case of acquisition-relatedrestructuring costs, we would recognize an acquired liability for costs we areobligated to incur in accordance with the acquisition method as defined in theapplicable accounting guidance.  Additionally, the cash flow impact ofan activity may not be recognized in the same period the expense isincurred.        24         RecentlyAdopted Accounting Pronouncements   In June2009, FASB established the ASC as the authoritative source of U.S. GenerallyAccepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). This pronouncement does not changecurrent GAAP, but is intended to simplify user research by providing all FASBliterature in a topical manner and in a single set of rules. All existingaccounting standard documents are superseded and all other accounting literaturenot included in the ASC is considered non-authoritative. These provisions wereeffective for fiscal years and interim periods ending after September 15, 2009.We adopted this statement as of September 15, 2009, and we have revised ourdisclosures by eliminating all references to pre-codification standards asrequired by ASC 105.   InJanuary, 2010, FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) to clarify thechange in ownership guidance and to expand the required disclosures for thedeconsolidation of a subsidiary.  The update was effective beginningin the period that an entity adopted these provisions.  We previouslyadopted this guidance as of December 27, 2008 and the update had no impact onour financial statements.   In August2009, FASB issued an ASU to reduce potential ambiguity in financial reportingwhen measuring the fair value of liabilities, specifically in circumstanceswhere a quoted a price in an active market for a similar liability is notavailable.  The guidance provided in this ASU is effective immediatelyand the adoption had no impact on our financial statements.   In June2009, FASB issued guidance on an ASC which requires reporting entities toevaluate former Qualified Special Purpose Entities (“QSPE”) for consolidation,changing the approach to determine a Variable Interest Entity’s (“VIE”) primarybeneficiary from a quantitative to a qualitative assessment and increasing thefrequency of reassessments for determining whether a company is the primarybeneficiary of a VIE.  This guidance also clarifies thecharacteristics that identify a VIE.  These provisions are effectivefor financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods endingafter November 15, 2009.  Adoption of these provisions did not have amaterial impact on our financial statements.   In May2009, FASB issued an ASC which establishes general standards of accounting for,and disclosures of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but beforefinancial statements are issued or are available to be issued.  ThisASC was effective for interim or fiscal periods ending after June 15,2009.  In December 2009, FASB amended this ASC to not requiredisclosure of the dates at which subsequent events were evaluated unless thefiling is for restated financial statements.  We have adopted theseprovisions as of December 25, 2009.  See Note 20 regarding ourevaluation of subsequent events.   In April2009, FASB issued an ASC which provides additional guidance on estimating fairvalue when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability hassignificantly decreased in relation to the normal market activity for the assetor liability.  Also, this ASC provides guidance on circumstances thatmay indicate that a transaction is not orderly. The guidance under this ASC waseffective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15,2009.   Adoption of these provisions did not have a materialimpact on our financial statements.   InDecember 2008, FASB issued guidance on an ASC which provides guidance on anemployer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension plan orother postretirement plans.  Specifically, these provisions addressconcentrations of risk in pension and postretirement plans, and are effectivefor financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods endingafter December 15, 2009. We have adopted these provisions and have expandedour disclosures as required.  See Note 9 regarding adoption of theseprovisions.   InNovember 2008, FASB issued guidance on an ASC which clarifies the accounting forcertain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity methodinvestments.  We adopted these provisions as of December 27, 2008 andthis adoption had no impact on our financial statements.   InOctober 2008, FASB issued guidance on an ASC which demonstrates how the fairvalue of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financialasset is inactive. These provisions were effective upon issuance, includingprior periods for which financial statements had not been issued. We adoptedthese provisions as of December 27, 2008 and this adoption had no impact on ourfinancial statements.   In June2008, FASB issued guidance on an ASC which states that unvested share-basedpayment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividendequivalents are required to be treated as participating securities and should beincluded in the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Adoption ofthese provisions is retrospective, therefore, all previously reported earningsper share data is restated to conform with the requirements of thispronouncement. We adopted these provisions as of December 27, 2008 andcalculated basic and diluted earnings per share under both the treasury stockmethod and the two-class method.  For the years ended December 25,2009,            25             December26, 2008 and December 28, 2007, there were no significant differences inthe per share amounts calculated under the two methods, therefore, we have notpresented the reconciliation of earnings per share under the two classmethod.  See Note 13 regarding adoption of this guidance.     In April2008, FASB issued guidance on an ASC which amends the factors an entity shouldconsider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining theuseful life of recognized intangible assets.  These provisions applyprospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with agroup of other assets in business combinations and assetacquisitions.  We adopted these provisions as of December 27, 2008 andthe adoption had no impact on our financial statements.   In March2008, FASB issued guidance on an ASC which applies to the disclosures of allderivative instruments and hedged items. These provisions amend and expandprevious disclosure requirements, requiring qualitative disclosures aboutobjectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures aboutfair value amounts and gains and losses on derivative instruments, anddisclosures about the credit risk related contingent features in derivativeagreements.  We adopted these provisions as of December 27, 2008 andhave expanded our disclosures as required.  See Note 16 regarding ouradoption of this guidance.   InDecember 2007, FASB issued guidance on an ASC which changed the accounting andreporting for minority interests, which were recharacterized as non-controllinginterests and classified as a component of equity.  In addition,companies are required to report a net income (loss) measure that includes theamounts attributable to such non-controlling interests. We adopted theseprovisions as of December 27, 2008 and they were applied prospectively to allnon-controlling interests. However, the presentation and disclosure requirementsof these provisions were applied retrospectively for all periodspresented.   InDecember 2007, FASB issued guidance on an ASC which changed the accounting forbusiness combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingentconsideration, contingencies, acquisition costs, in-process research anddevelopment costs and restructuring costs.  In addition, theseprovisions change the method of measurement for deferred tax asset valuationallowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a businesscombination.  We adopted these provisions as of December 27, 2008 andthe adoption had no impact on our financial statements.   NewAccounting Pronouncements   InJanuary 2010, FASB issued an ASU which requires additional disclosures relatedto transfers between levels in the hierarchy of fair valuemeasurement.  This ASU is effective for interim and annual reportingperiods beginning after December 15, 2009.  We are currentlyevaluating the effect that this ASU may have on our financialstatements.   InOctober 2009, the FASB issued an ASU to address the accounting formultiple-deliverable sales arrangements.  The update provides guidanceto enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately,rather than as a combined unit.  This ASU also expands the requireddisclosures related to a vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenuearrangements.  This guidance will be effective prospectively forrevenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal yearsbeginning on or after June 15, 2010.  We are currently evaluating theeffect that this ASU may have on our financial statements.        26         Resultsof Operations   Yearended December 25, 2009 compared to the year ended December 26,2008   The tablebelow shows our results of continuing operations and the absolute and percentagechange in those results from period to period ( in thousands ):                                     Change          Change       Results      as %  of      net sales                    2009          2008          $          %       2009          2008        Net      sales      $  398,803        $  626,270        $  (227,467  )        (36.3  )%        100.0  %        100.0  %    Cost      of sales         298,035           477,763           179,728           37.6           ( 74.7  )        ( 76.3  )                                                                                      Gross      profit         100,768           148,507           (47,739  )        (32.1  )        25.3           23.7                                                                                         Selling,      general and administrative expenses         89,698           123,203           33,505           27.2           (22.5  )        (19.7  )    Severance,      impairment and other associated costs         82,867           153,294           70,427           45.9           ( 20.8  )        ( 24.5  )                                                                                      Operating      loss         (71,797  )        (127,990  )        56,193           43.9           (18.0  )        (20.5  )                                                                                      Interest      expense, net         (2,967  )        (2,623  )        (344  )        (13.1  )        (0.7  )        (0.4  )    Other      income, net         3,784           4,072           ( 288  )        (7.1  )        0.9           0.7                                                                                         Loss      from continuing operations before income taxes         (70,980  )        (126,541  )        55,561           43.9           (17.8  )        (20.2  )                                                                                      Income      tax expense (benefit)         1,879           ( 2,998  )        ( 4,877  )        (162.7  )        ( 0.5  )        0.5                                                                                         Net      loss from continuing operations      $  ( 72,859  )     $  ( 123,553  )     $  50,694           41.0  %        ( 18.3  )%        ( 19.7  )%     Net Sales . Our consolidatednet sales decreased by 36.3% as a result of the decline in customer demandresulting from the adverse developments in the global economy.  Theoverall demand reduction realized during the year ended December 25, 2009 wasincurred generally across all of our wireless, network communications and powerproducts throughout the year.  However, demand began to improve in thesecond half of 2009 in most markets.  Also, a stronger U.S. dollarrelative to the euro experienced during the year ended December 25, 2009 ascompared to the same period of 2008 resulted in lower U.S. dollar reportedsales.   Cost ofSales .  As aresult of lower sales, our cost of sales decreased.  Our consolidatedgross margin for the year ended December 25, 2009 was 25.3 % c ompared to 23. 7 % for the year ended December 26,2008.  The primary factors that caused our consolidated gross marginincrease were the positive effects of cost-reduction and price increasingactivities initiated in late 2008 as a response to the adverse conditions in theglobal economy.  Partially offsetting these activities was a declinein operating leverage as a result of decreased sales of our wireless, networkcommunications and power products during 2009.   Selling, General and AdministrativeExpenses .  Total selling, general and administrative expensesdecreased primarily due to our overall emphasis on cost reducing measuresinitiated at the end of 2008 in response to the overall economicdownturn.  Expenses were reduced in virtually all administrativeareas.  Also, intangible amortization expense declined compared to the2008 period as a result of the impairment charges on finite-lived intangibleswhich were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.   Research,development and engineering expenses (“RD&E”) are included in selling,general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 25, 2009 andDecember 26, 2008, respectively, RD&E was as follows ( in thousands ):                   2009          2008        RD&E      $  28,174        $  42,559       Percentage      of sales         7.1  %        6.8  %          27         Thedecrease in research, development and engineering expenses is due to our costreducing initiative beginning at the end of in 2008.  However, as apercentage of sales, 2009 spending was at a higher level as compared to the 2008period.  We believe that future sales in the electronic componentsmarkets will be driven by next-generation products. As a result, design anddevelopment activities with our OEM customers continue at an aggressive pacethat is consistent with market activity.   Severance, Impairment and OtherAssociated Costs . During the year ended December 25, 2009, wedetermined that approximately $71.0 million of our wireless group’s goodwill wasimpaired.  Refer to Note 5 for furtherdetails.  Additionally, we incurred a charge of $11.9 million for anumber of cost reduction actions.  These charges include severance andrelated payments of $3.0 million and fixed asset impairments of $8.9million.  The impaired assets include production lines associated withproducts that have no expected future demand and two real estate propertieswhich were disposed.   During2008, we determined that $310.4 million of goodwill and other intangibles wereimpaired, including $170.3 million of goodwill and identifiable intangibles of adiscontinued operation.  Additionally, our continuing operationsincurred a charge of $13.2 million for a number of cost reductionactions.  These charges include severance and related payments andother associated costs of $5.5 million resulting from the termination ofmanufacturing and support personnel at our operations primarily in Asia, Europeand North America and $4.1 million of other costs primarily resulting from thetransfer of manufacturing operations from Europe and North Africa toAsia.  We also recorded fixed asset impairments of $3.6million.   Interest .  Netinterest expense increased primarily as a result of the accelerated amortizationof capitalized loan fees resulting from credit facility amendments effective in2009.  Interest on our outstanding loans and amortization ofcapitalized loan fees was allocated between continuing and discontinuedoperations on a pro-rata basis for the year ended December 25, 2009 and thecomparable period in 2008, based upon the actual and expected debt to be repaidas a result of the dispositions compared to total debtoutstanding.  Also, interest income in the year ended December 25,2009 was significantly lower than the comparable period in 2008 due to loweraverage cash balances during 2009.   Other .  Thedecrease in other income is primarily attributable to lower net foreign exchangegains realized during the year ended December 25, 2009 of $3.5 million, ascompared to net foreign exchange gains of $4.1 million incurred in thecomparable period of 2008.  The primary reason for the decrease inforeign exchange gains during the year ended December 25, 2009 was due to theeffects of a larger strengthening of the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rateduring 2008 as compared to 2009.   Income Taxes .  Theeffective income tax rate for the year ended December 25, 2009 was (2.6%)compared to 2.4% for the year ended December 26, 2008.   The 2009effective tax rate was affected by the $71.0 million of goodwill impairmentcharges recorded in 2009 which were non-deductible.  In addition, the2009 tax rate was negatively impacted by certain losses and restructuringcharges incurred by entities in high-tax jurisdictions where the future taxbenefit is unlikely to be realized.       DiscontinuedOperations.   Net loss from discontinued operations wasapproximately ($120.0) million during the year ended December 25, 2009 ascompared to approximately ($151.5) million in the year ended December 26, 2008.Results for the 2009 period include charges of approximately $109.3 to writedown our net investment in these operations to the net proceeds received orexpected to be received, charges for the curtailment and settlement of certainretirement plan benefits and allocated interest expense based upon the debtretired or expected to be retired.   Similar interest charges in2008 were approximately $9.7 million.  The 2008 period also reflects acharge for the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets ofMedtech of approximately $170.3 million.  A summary of our net lossfrom each of our discontinued operations for the years ended December 25, 2009and December 26, 2008 is as follows ( in thousands ):                   2009          2008        Electrical      $  (61,926  )     $  9,063       Medtech         (48,399  )        (159,277  )    MEMS         ( 9,653  )        ( 1,253  )    Total      $  ( 119,978  )     $  ( 151,467  )          28         Yearended December 26, 2008 compared to the year ended December 28,2007   The tablebelow shows our results of our continuing operations and the absolute andpercentage change in those results from period to period ( in thousands ):                                      Change          Change       Results      as %  of      net sales                    2008          2007          $          %       2008          2007        Net      sales      $  626,270        $  671,569        $  (45,299  )        (6.7  )%        100.0  %        100.0  %    Cost      of sales         477,763           496,471           18,708           3.8           ( 76.3  )        ( 73.9  )                                                                                      Gross      profit         148,507           175,098           (26,591  )        (15.2  )        23.7           26.1       Selling,      general and administrative Expenses         123,203           112,430           (10,773  )        (      9.6  )        (19.7  )        (16.7  )    Severance,      impairment and other associated costs         153,294           17,650           ( 135,644  )        (768.5  )        ( 24.5  )        ( 2.6  )                                                                                      Operating      (loss) profit         (127,990  )        45,018           (173,088  )        (384.3  )        (20.5  )        6.8                                                                                         Interest      expense, net         (2,623  )        (427  )        (2,196  )        (514.3  )        (0.4  )        (0.1  )    Other      income (expense), net         4,072           ( 1,077  )        5,149           478.1           0.7           ( 0.2  )                                                                                      (Loss)      earnings from continuing operations before income taxes         (126,541  )        43,514           (170,055  )        (390.8  )        (20.2  )        6.5                                                                                         Income      tax (benefit) expense         ( 2,988  )        1,341           4,329           322.8           0.5           ( 0.2  )                                                                                      Net      (loss) earnings from continuing operations      $  ( 123,553  )     $  42,173        $  ( 165,726  )        (393.0  )%        ( 19.7  )%        6.3  %      Net Sales . The decrease inconsolidated net sales in the year ended December 26, 2008 compared to the yearended December 28, 2007 was primarily attributable to a decline in demand forcertain wireless, network and power products, particularly in the second half of2008 coinciding with the initial decline in the global economy. Also, 2008 salesdeclined due to a temporary capacity constraint related to employee retentiondifficulties surrounding the Chinese New Year and the temporary operationsstoppage in Mianyang, China caused by an earthquake.   Partiallyoffsetting the sales decline were additional sales from the inclusion of tenmonths of the mobile communications group acquired in the Sonion acquisition andhigher euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates incurred in 2008 as compared to2007.   Cost of Sales .  Asa result of lower sales, our cost of sales decreased.  Ourconsolidated gross margin for the year ended December 26, 2008 was 23.7%compared to 26.1% for the year ended December 28 2007.  The primaryfactors that caused the reduction in our consolidated gross margin decrease werea decline in operating leverage as a result of reduced sales of our wirelessnetwork communication and power products, coupled with increased training andother personnel costs incurred related to the capacity constraints caused by theMianyang earthquake.   Selling, General and AdministrativeExpenses .  Total selling, general and administrative expensesincreased primarily due to additional expenses from the inclusion of ten monthsof the mobile communications group acquired in the Sonionacquisition.  Also, the higher euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rateincurred in 2008 as compared to 2007 increased selling, general andadministrative expenses.   Research,development and engineering expenses are included in selling, general andadministrative expenses.  For the year ended December 26, 2008 andDecember 28, 2007, respectively, RD&E was as follows ( in thousands) :                   2008          2007        RD&E      $  42,559        $  35,137       Percentage      of sales         6.8  %         5.2             29         Theincrease in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due tothe inclusion of ten months of the mobile communications group acquired in theSonion acquisition.  Also, the higher euro-to-U.S. dollar exchangerate incurred in 2008 as compared to 2007 increased selling, general andadministrative expenses.   Severance, Impairment and OtherAssociated Costs .  During 2008, we determined that $310.4million of goodwill and other intangibles were impaired, including $170.3million of goodwill and identifiable intangibles of a discontinuedoperation.  Additionally, we incurred a charge of $13.2 million to ourcontinuing operations for a number of cost reduction actions.  Thesecharges include severance and related payments and other associated costs of$5.5 million resulting from the termination of manufacturing and supportpersonnel at our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and North America and $4.1million of other costs primarily resulting from the transfer of manufacturingoperations from Europe and North Africa to Asia.  Additionally, werecorded fixed asset impairments of $3.6 million.   During2007, we incurred a charge of $17.6 million for cost reductionactions.  These include severance and related payments of $10.6million resulting from the termination of manufacturing and support personnel inAsia, Europe and North America, $5.5 million for the write down of certain fixedassets to their disposal values and, additionally, we incurred approximately$1.5 million of other plant closure, relocation and similar costs associatedwith these actions.   Interest .  Netinterest expense increased primarily as a result of higher average debt balancesin 2008 as compared to 2007.  Interest expense on our outstandingloans was allocated between continuing and discontinued operations on a pro-ratabasis for the year ended December 26, 2008 and the comparable period in 2007,based upon the actual and expected debt to be repaid with the proceeds of thedivestitures compared to total debt outstanding.  In addition, weincurred higher amortization of capitalized loan fees resulting from our creditfacility amendment.   Interest income in the year ended December26, 2008 was significantly lower than the comparable period in 2007 due to loweraverage cash balances during 2008.   Other .  Theincrease in other income is primarily attributable to higher net foreignexchange gains incurred during the year ended December 26, 2008 of $4.1 million,as compared to foreign exchange losses of $1.3 million during the year endedDecember 28, 2007.  The primary reason for the increase in foreignexchange gains was the overall strengthening of the euro as compared to the U.S.dollar in 2008 as compared to 2007.   Income Taxes .  Theeffective income tax rate for the year ended December 26, 2008 was 2.4% comparedto 3.1% for the year ended December 28, 2007. The decrease in the effective taxrate is primarily a result of the non-deductibility of the impairment ofgoodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets in 2008, thus reducing thetax benefits on the overall loss.   DiscontinuedOperations.   Net loss from discontinued operations wasapproximately ($151.5) million during the year ended December 26, 2008 ascompared to net earnings of approximately $19.7 million in the year endedDecember 28, 2007.  Results in the 2008 period include charges ofapproximately $9.7 million resulting from allocated interest expense based uponthe debt retired or expected to be retired and a charge of approximately $170.3million resulting from the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangibleassets at Medtech.   A summary of our net (loss) earnings fromeach of our discontinued operations for the years ended December 26, 2008 andDecember 28, 2007 is as follows ( in thousands ):                     2008          2007        Electrical      $  9,063        $  19,740       Medtech         (159,277  )        --       MEMS         ( 1,253  )        --       Total      $  ( 151,467  )     $  19,740        BusinessOutlook   Theadverse developments in the financial markets and the dramatic contractions inthe global economy that began in 2008 have increased our exposure to liquidityand credit risks. We are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in theprices of commodities, such as non-precious metals and certainfuels.  To the extent we cannot transfer these costs to our customers,fluctuations in commodity prices will impact our gross margin and availablecash.  We are also exposed to financial risk resulting from changes ininterest and foreign currency rates, as well as the credit risk of ourcustomers.   Althoughwe expect net sales to continue to improve, customer and product mix will impactour gross margin, net income, EBITDA and cash available to repay ourdebt.  For example, while handset production generally has begun torecover from early 2009 levels, a significant portion of handset antennabusiness currently served by our wireless group has begun a transition away fromOEM driven hardware development and manufacturing, a transition led by a            30             largeOEM customer seeking to purchase full handset modules from one of several CEMswho can each provide full handset modules.  Accordingly, our wirelessgroup is adjusting its marketing and engineering efforts to significantlyincrease its support for those CEMs as well as for OEMs which have not embracedthis sourcing change and for the sources which will provide full handsets to theOEM principally driving this change.  Based on the expected revenuesand cash flows of our wireless group, an impairment of goodwill or identifiableintangibles is not necessary at this time.  Our network group isexperiencing a surge of demand which began in the second half of2009.  Our ability to meet this demand has been constrained bycapacity issues in the PRC resulting from tight labormarkets.  However, we continue to vigorously address this issue byincreasing our capacity through varying means, including the use of temporarystaff.     Consideringthe issues mentioned above, as well as other risks inherent in our business andtaking into account our significant reduction of debt as a result ofdivestitures, we believe we have ample liquidity to fund our businessrequirements.  This belief is based on our current balances of cashand cash equivalents, our history of positive cash flows from continuingoperations, including $37.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2009, andaccess to our multi-currency credit facility.  Our credit agreementrequires that we maintain certain financial covenants which are measured at theend of each fiscal quarter.  The primary covenants are senior secureddebt and fixed charges compared to our rolling four-quarter EBITDA as defined bythe amended and restated credit agreement.  If we are not able tomaintain the EBITDA level required relative to our senior secured debt or fixedcharges, we would default on our covenants.  We have substantiallydecreased our borrowings from the credit facility through the issuance of $50.0million of convertible senior notes in December 2009, which are not subject tocovenant calculations.  Accordingly, we believe that we will continuegenerating sufficient EBITDA and free cash flows in the foreseeable future toremain compliant with our covenants.   Liquidityand Capital Resources   We havepresented all assets and liabilities of Electrical as current due to theirclassification as held for sale.  Such classification resulted inapproximately $7.9 million of assets and $0.3 million of liabilities to beclassified as current which would otherwise be consideredlong-term.   Includingassets and liabilities held for sale, working capital as of December 25, 2009was $121.3 million, compared to $175.9 million as of December 26,2008.  The decrease of $54.6 million was primarily due to reductionsin trade receivables, prepaid expenses and inventory, partially offset bydecreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other currentliabilities.  Also, our working capital decrease was partially offsetby the elimination of current installments of long-term debt which wereassociated with our former senior secured term loan and an unsecured term loanat Electrical.  Cash and cash equivalents, which are included inworking capital, decreased from $41.4 million as of  December 26, 2008to $39.7 million as of December 25, 2009.   Wepresent our statement of cash flows using the indirect method.  Ourmanagement has found that investors and analysts typically refer to changes inaccounts receivable, inventory and other components of working capital whenanalyzing operating cash flows. Also, changes in working capital are moredirectly related to the way we manage our business and cash flow than are itemssuch as cash receipts from the sale of goods, as would appear using the directmethod.  Cash flows from discontinued operations have been separatedfrom continuing operations and are disclosed in the aggregate by each cash flowactivity.   Net cashprovided by operating activities was $37.3 million for the year ended December25, 2009 as compared to $43.3 million in the comparable period of 2008, adecrease of $6.0 million. The decrease from 2008 to 2009 is primarily a resultof decreased reductions of net working capital.  Despite improvementsin demand in late 2009, our management team has continued to reduce inventoryand has managed to improve the aging of our accounts receivables throughout2009.   Capitalexpenditures were $2.2 million during the year ended December 25, 2009 and $11.6million in the comparable period of 2008.  The decrease of $9.4million in the 2009 period was due primarily to a concentrated effort in 2009 tolimit new investment to only key programs.  Additionally, spending in2008 included the completion of our production facility in Mianyang,China.  We make capital expenditures to expand production capacity andto improve our operating efficiency. We plan to continue making suchexpenditures in the future as and when necessary.   We used$6.7 million for dividend payments during the year ended December 25,2009.  On November 2, 2009 we announced a quarterly cash dividend of$0.025 per common share, payable on January 15, 2010 to shareholders of recordon January 1, 2010.  This quarterly dividend resulted in a cashpayment to shareholders of approximately $1.0 million in the first quarter of2010.  We expect cash payments for dividends to be approximately $4.1million in 2010.   During2009, we contributed approximately $6.1 million to our principal defined benefitplans.  We expect to contribute approximately $4.5 million in 2010after the disposition of Electrical is completed.        31         OnDecember 22, 2009, we issued $50.0 million in convertible senior notes, whichwill mature on December 15, 2014.  The notes bear a coupon rate of7.0% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 andDecember 15 of each year, beginning with our June 15, 2010 payment. We expect topay $3.5 million of interest on these notes in 2010. We incurred debt issuancecosts of approximately $3.0 million in 2009, which have been deferred and willbe amortized over the life of the notes.   Theconvertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and are equal in right ofpayment with our senior unsecured debt, but senior to any subordinateddebt.  Further, these convertible notes rank junior to any of oursecured indebtedness to the extent of the assets that secure such indebtedness,and are structurally subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness andother liabilities and commitments of our subsidiaries.   Holdersof our convertible notes may convert their shares to common stock at theiroption any day prior to the close of business on December 14,2014.  Upon conversion, for each $1,000 in principal amountoutstanding, we will deliver a number of shares of our common stock equal to theconversion rate. The initial conversion rate for the notes is approximately156.64 shares of common stock per $1,000 in principal amount ofnotes.  The initial conversion price is approximately $6.38 per shareof common stock.  The conversion rate is subject to change upon theoccurrence of specified normal and customary events as defined by the indenture,such as stock splits or stock dividends, but will not be adjusted for accruedinterest.   Subjectto certain fundamental change exceptions specified in the indenture, whichgenerally pertain to circumstances in which the majority of our common stock isobtained, exchanged or no longer available for trading, holders may require usto repurchase all or part of their notes for cash, at a price equal to 100% ofthe principal amount of the notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaidinterest up to, but excluding, the relevant repurchasedate.   However, we are not permitted to redeem the notes priorto maturity.   OnDecember 2, 2009, we finalized an amendment to our credit agreement thatpermitted us to issue senior convertible notes and restated certain otherprovisions of our previous agreement. The amended and restated credit agreementprovides for a $100.0 million senior revolving credit facility and provides forborrowing in U.S. dollars, euros and yen, with a multicurrency facilityproviding for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not toexceed the U.S. dollar equivalent of $10.0 million.   Theamended and restated credit agreement does not permit us to increase the totalcommitment without the consent of our lenders. Therefore, the total amountoutstanding under the revolving credit facility may not exceed $100.0million.  The amount outstanding under our credit facility as ofDecember 25, 2009 was $81.0 million.   Outstandingborrowings are subject to leverage and fixed charges covenants, which arecomputed on a rolling four-quarter basis as of the most recentquarter-end.  Each covenant requires the calculation of EBITDAaccording to a definition prescribed by the amended and restated creditagreement.   Theleverage covenant requires our total debt outstanding, excluding the seniorconvertible notes, to not exceed the following multiples of our prior fourquarters’ EBITDA:        Applicable      date   ( Period      or quarter ended )    EBITDA       Multiple     December      2009    3.50x     March      2010    3.00x     Thereafter    2.75x       The fixedcharges covenant requires that our EBITDA exceed total fixed charges, as definedby the amended credit agreement, by the following multiples:        Applicable      date  ( Period      or quarter ended )    EBITDA       Multiple     December      2009    1.25x     Thereafter    1.50x       We werein compliance with the covenants required by the amended and restated creditfacility as of December 25, 2009.        32         The feeon the unborrowed portion of the commitment ranges from 0.225% to 0.450% of thetotal commitment, depending on the following debt-to-EBITDA ratios:       Total debt-to-EBITDA ratio       Commitment fee percentage        Less      than 0.75         0.225  %    Less      than 1.50         0.250  %    Less      than 2.25         0.300  %    Less      than 2.75         0.350  %    Less      than 3.25         0.375  %    Less      than 3.75         0.400  %    Greater      than 3.75         0.450  %     Theinterest rate for each currency’s borrowing is a combination of the base ratefor that currency plus a credit margin spread.   Thecredit margin spread is the same for each currency and ranges from 1.25% to3.25%, depending on the following debt-to-EBITDA ratios:            Total debt-to-EBITDA      ratio       Credit margin spread        Less      than 0.75         1.25  %    Less      than 1.50         1.50  %    Less      than 2.25         2.00  %    Less      than 2.75         2.50  %    Less      than 3.25         2.75  %    Less      than 3.75         3.00  %    Greater      than 3.75         3.25  %     Theweighted-average interest rate, including the credit margin spread, wasapproximately 3.5% as of December 25, 2009.   Theamended and restated credit agreement limits our annual cash dividends to $5.0million.  Also, there are covenants specifying capital expenditurelimitations and other customary and normal provisions.   Multiplesubsidiaries, both domestic and international, have guaranteed the obligationsincurred under the amended and restated credit agreement.  Inaddition, certain domestic and international subsidiaries have pledged theshares of certain subsidiaries, as well as selected accounts receivable,inventory, machinery and equipment and other assets as collateral. If we defaulton our obligations, our lenders may take possession of the collateral and maylicense, sell or otherwise dispose of those related assets in order to satisfyour obligations.   During2009, we incurred costs of approximately $5.1 million related to current yearamendments to our credit facility, which have been deferred and will beamortized over its remaining term. In addition, we recorded a charge ofapproximately $6.3 million to impair previously capitalized fees and costs thatrelated to our February 28, 2008 credit agreement and its relatedamendments.  Of the $6.3 million of charges, $4.7 million wasallocated to discontinued operations on a pro-rata basis for the year endedDecember 25, 2009, based upon the debt retired or expected to be retiredfrom the dispositions compared to our total debt outstanding.  Similarfees of our continuing operations are classified as interest expense on ourConsolidated Statement of Operations.   We hadfour standby letters of credit outstanding at December 25, 2009 in the aggregateamount of $1.9 million securing transactions entered into in the ordinary courseof business.   Electrical,the segment we are in the process of divesting, uses silver and other preciousmetals in manufacturing some of its electrical contacts, contact materials andcontact subassemblies. Historically, Electrical has leased or held thesematerials through consignment-type arrangements with its suppliers. Leasing andconsignment costs have typically been lower than the costs to borrow funds topurchase the metals and, more importantly, these arrangements eliminate theeffects of fluctuations in the market price of owned precious metal and enableElectrical to minimize its inventories. Electrical’s terms of sale generallyallow it to charge customers for precious metal content based on the marketvalue of precious metal on the day after shipment to thecustomer.  Suppliers invoice Electrical based on the market value ofthe precious metal on the day after shipment to the customer aswell.  Thus far, Electrical has been successful in managing the costsassociated with its precious metals. While limited amounts are purchased for usein production, the majority of precious metal inventory continues to be leasedor held on consignment. If leasing or consignment costs increase significantlyin a short period of time, and Electrical is unable to recover these increasedcosts through higher sales prices, a negative impact on Electrical’s results ofoperations and liquidity may result. Leasing             33             andconsignment fee increases are caused primarily by increases in interest rates orvolatility in the price of the consigned material.  Similarly, ifElectrical is unable to maintain the necessary bank commitments and creditlimits necessary for its precious metal leasing and consignment facilities, orobtain alternative facilities on a timely basis, Electrical may be required tofinance the direct purchase of precious metals, reduce its production volume ortake other actions that could negatively impact its financial condition andresults of operations.     Electricalhad commercial commitments outstanding at December 25, 2009 of approximately$113.4 million due under precious metal consignment-type leases.  Thisrepresents a decrease of $9.4 million from the $122.8 million outstanding as ofDecember 26, 2008 and is attributable to significant volume decreases offset byhigher silver prices during the year ended December 25, 2009.   OnJanuary 4, 2010, we completed the sale of Electrical’s North American businessfor an amount immaterial to our Consolidated FinancialStatements.  Electrical’s North American business has manufacturingfacilities in Export, Pennsylvania, Luquillo, Puerto Rico and Mexico City,Mexico.  The rivet production operations located in Mexico City werenot part of the sale agreement, as these operations are intended to be sold aspart of Electrical’s operations in Europe and Asia.  We applied thenet proceeds from the sale to reduce the debt outstanding under our revolvingcredit facility.  In conjunction with the disposition of the NorthAmerican operations of Electrical on January 4, 2010, our consignment-typeleases were reduced by $13.9 million.  We expect to further reduceNorth America’s consignment-type leases by approximately $18.0 million by April15, 2010.   The netdecrease in cash resulting from discontinued operations was $26.2 million forthe year ended December 25, 2009.  Cash used in operating activitieswas approximately $8.2 million which was primarily a result of the changes inworking capital and the net losses of these operations excluding depreciation,amortization and impairment charges. Capital expenditures were $6.2 which areincluded in investing activities.  Also, Electrical made principlepayments of long-term debt of approximately $7.4 million which are included innet cash used in financing activities. We do not expect these uses of cash torecur and we also do not expect significant continuing cash flows from theseoperations after their disposition.   Excludingthe impact of the North American business which was disposed in January 2010,Electrical's remaining operations generate positive net cash flows which couldbe used to pay down our debt or fund our ongoing operations. Further, we believethe inclusion of Electrical in our calculations of covenant compliance andavailable debt capacity would increase our borrowing capacity.   Materialchanges in our contractual obligations during the year ended December 25, 2009include the amendments to our credit facility during 2009, the incrementalbenefits recognized on the Technitrol, Inc. Supplemental Retirement Plan, theissuance of our convertible senior notes and the elimination of obligationsrelated to our former Medtech business.   As ofDecember 25, 2009, future payments related to contractual obligations were asfollows ( inthousands ):                   Amounts      expected to be paid by period                    Total (4)          Less than 1 year          1 to 3 years          3 to 5 years          Thereafter                                                               Long-term      debt  (1)      $  81,000        $  --        $  --        $  81,000        $  --       Convertible      senior notes      $  50,000        $  --        $  --        $  50,000        $  --       Estimated      interest payments  (1)      $  26,387        $  6,320        $  12,640        $  7,427        $  --       Operating      leases  (2)      $  15,319        $  5,645        $  5,681        $  1,691        $  2,302       Retirement      plans  (3)      $  33,536        $  13,535        $  3,836        $  4,136        $  12,029                       (1)    Excludes      expected payments from a sale of Electrical that would result in a      reduction of debt and lower interestpayments.                    (2)    Excludes      approximately $113.4 million due under precious metal consignment–type      leases and approximately $2.5 million due under operating leases at      Electrical.                    (3)    Includes      an estimated cash settlement of the Technitrol, Inc. Supplemental      Retirement Plan which is contingent upon the sale of      Electrical.                    (4)    Excludes      other obligations under employment contracts that are generally only      payable upon a change of control.      We haveexcluded from the table above unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertaintyof the amount and the period of payment.  As of December 25, 2009, wehad unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $23.2 million.  Referto Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.        34         Webelieve that the combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and,if necessary, borrowings under our amended credit agreement will be sufficientto satisfy our operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future. Inaddition, we may use internally generated funds or obtain additional borrowingsor additional equity offerings for acquisitions of suitable businesses orassets.   We havenot experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in whichwe operate and none are foreseen. However, foreign exchange ceilings imposed bylocal governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which foreigngovernments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cashmovements from time to time. We expect to reinvest this cash and earningsoutside of the United States, because we anticipate that a significant portionof our opportunities for future growth will be abroad.  In addition,we expect to use a significant portion of the cash to service debt outside theUnited States.  Thus, we have not accrued U.S. income and foreignwithholding taxes on foreign earnings that have been indefinitely investedabroad.  If these earnings were brought back to the United States,significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the United States as severalcountries in which we operate have tax rates significantly lower than the U.S.statutory rate.   All ofour retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions as ofDecember 25, 2009, with the exception of approximately $30.2 million of retainedearnings primarily in the PRC, that are restricted in accordance with Section 58of the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprises Law.  The $30.2 millionincludes approximately $5.7 million of retained earnings of a majority ownedsubsidiary and approximately $1.9 million of a discontinued operation. Theamount restricted in accordance with the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprise Lawis applicable to all foreign investment enterprises doing business in thePRC.  The restriction applies to 10% of our net earnings in the PRC,limited to 50% of the total capital invested in the PRC.   Item  7a   Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures aboutMarket Risk   InterestRate Risk   Ourfinancial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debtborrowed under our revolving credit facility, are exposed to changes in interestrates in both the U.S. and abroad.  We invest our excess cash inshort-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities.  Wegenerally limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extentpractical. Our Board of Directors has adopted policies relating to these risksand continually monitors compliance with these policies.   Ourrevolving credit facility has variable interest rates.  Accordingly,interest expense may increase if we borrow and/or if the rates associated withour borrowings move higher.  In addition, we may pursue additional oralternative financing.  We may also use financial derivatives such asinterest rate swaps or other instruments in order to manage the risk associatedwith changes in market interest rates.  However, we have not used anyof these instruments to date.   The tablebelow presents principal amounts in U.S. dollars and related weighted averageinterest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations.  Thecolumn captioned  “Approximate Fair Value” sets forth the carryingvalue of our long-term debt as of December 25, 2009 after taking intoconsideration the current interest rates of our amended creditfacility.  As our convertible senior notes were issued three daysprior to our 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet date, we consider their carryingvalue to approximate their fair value ( in thousands ):                   2010          2011          2012          2013          2014          Therea fter          Total          Approx.
