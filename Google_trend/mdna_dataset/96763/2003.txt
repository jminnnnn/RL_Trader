Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results        of Operations  Introduction        This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as well as other sections of this report, contain certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in "Risk Factors" section of this report on page 7 through 13.  Critical Accounting Policies        The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 37 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for inventory provisions, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, restructuring expense and acquisition related restructuring costs, income taxes, and contingency accruals. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.        Inventory Provisions. Inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts estimated by taking into account actual purchases of our products over the recent past and customer forecasts. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and or customer requirements, we may be required to write down our inventory and our gross margin could be negatively affected. If we were to sell or use a significant portion of inventory already written down, our gross margin could be positively affected.        Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles. We will assess goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances. In addition, in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.        Restructuring Expense and Acquisition Related Restructuring Costs. Our recent restructuring activities, which related to our existing and recently acquired businesses, were designed to reduce both our fixed and variable costs, particularly in response to the dramatically reduced demand for our products in the electronics components industry. These costs included the closing of facilities and the termination of employees. Acquisition-related costs are included in the allocation of the cost of the acquired business and are added to goodwill. Other restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incur those costs, and all of the requirements for accrual are met in accordance with the applicable guidance. Restructuring costs are recorded based upon our best estimates at the time such as estimated residual values. Our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs. If this occurs, we would adjust our initial estimates in future periods. In the case of acquisition-related restructuring costs, and depending on whether the assets impacted came from the acquired entity and the timing of the restructuring charge, such adjustment would generally require a change in value of the goodwill appearing on our balance sheet, which may not affect our earnings. In the case of other restructuring costs, we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods if our initial estimates were too low, or reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially if our initial estimates were too high.        Income Taxes. We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings as calculated for income tax purposes, because, in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes - Special Areas ("APB 23") we intend to reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. indefinitely. If we encounter a significant domestic need for liquidity that we cannot fulfill through borrowings, equity offerings, or other internal or external sources, we may experience unfavorable tax consequences as cash invested outside the U.S. is transferred to the U.S. This adverse consequence would occur if the transfer of cash into the U.S. were subject to income tax without sufficient foreign tax credits available to offset the U.S. tax liability.        Contingency Accruals. During the normal course of business, a variety of issues may arise, which may result in litigation, environmental compliance and other contingent obligations. In developing our contingency                                    Page 17 of 62   accruals we consider both the likelihood of a loss or incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of exposure. We record contingency accruals when a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We periodically evaluate available information to assess whether contingency accruals should be adjusted. We could be required to record additional expenses in future periods if our initial estimates were too low, or reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially if our estimates were too high.  Overview        We are a global producer of precision-engineered passive magnetics-based electronic components and electrical contact products and materials. We believe we are a leading global producer of these products and materials in the primary markets we serve based on our estimates of the size of our primary markets in annual revenues and our share of those markets relative to our competitors.        We operate our business in two distinct segments:        o     the electronic components segment, which operates under the name             Pulse, and        o     the electrical contact products segment, which operates under the             name AMI Doduco.        General. We experienced consistent growth in net sales from fiscal 1991 through fiscal 2000. We define net sales as gross sales less returns and allowances. We sometimes refer to net sales as revenue. During this time period, the growth in our consolidated net sales has been due in large part to the growth of Pulse. However, since late 2000, the electronics markets served by Pulse have experienced a severe global contraction. While we currently do not have a great deal of visibility with respect to future demand for our products, particularly at Pulse, we believe that in 2002, many of the markets we serve began to stabilize, but at very low levels. We believe that a broad-based market rebound will be erratic and gradual probably lasting several years. In markets where unit demand has recovered, downward pressure on selling prices have kept total revenue from growing in a manner consistent with unit growth.        Demand slowed at AMI Doduco as we entered 2002, mirroring the prevailing economic conditions in North America and Europe. However, during 2002 AMI Doduco has experienced increases in design and quoting activities for component subassemblies in Europe. This includes component subassemblies for automotive applications such as multi-function switches, motor control sensors and ignition security systems, and for non-automotive uses such as appliance and industrial controls and medical equipment. AMI Doduco continued cost reduction actions in 2002 including workforce adjustments in line with demand around the world. AMI Doduco also completed the North American plant consolidation in 2002, as well as the consolidation of all European contact pre-material production into our Pforzheim, Germany facility and other product and plant consolidation actions in Europe in 2002.        In 2002, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $15.7 million, net of income tax benefit, related to AMI Doduco as a cumulative effect of accounting change. We also recorded a trade name impairment charge of $32.1 million, less a $12.8 million income tax benefit, related to Pulse.        Historically, the gross margin at Pulse has been significantly higher than at AMI Doduco. As a result, the mix of net sales generated by Pulse and AMI Doduco during a period affects our consolidated gross margin. Over the past 18 months, our gross margin has been positively impacted by the savings from our various restructuring activities and ongoing cost and expense controls. Our gross margin is also significantly affected by capacity utilization, particularly at AMI Doduco. Pulse's markets are characterized by a relatively short-term product life cycle compared to AMI Doduco. As a result, significant product turnover occurs each year. Therefore, Pulse's changes in average selling prices do not necessarily provide a meaningful and quantifiable measure of Pulse's operations. AMI Doduco has a relatively long-term and mature product line, without significant turnover, compared to Pulse, with minimal variation in the prices of product sold. Therefore, changes in prices do not have a material impact on AMI Doduco revenue. Accordingly, substantially all of the sales growth and contraction at AMI Doduco is attributable to changes in unit volume.        Acquisitions. Historically, acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy. In many cases, our move into new and high-growth extensions of our existing product lines or markets has been facilitated by an acquisition. Our acquisitions continually change the mix of our net sales. Pulse made numerous acquisitions in recent years which have increased our penetration into our primary markets and expanded our presence in new markets. Recent examples of these acquisitions include Excelsus, and the consumer electronics business of Eldor Corporation. Excelsus was acquired in August 2001 for approximately $85.9 million, net of cash acquired. Excelsus was based in Carlsbad, California and was a leading producer of customer-premises digital subscriber line filters and other                                    Page 18 of 62   broadband accessories. Pulse acquired Eldor's consumer electronics business in January 2003. Accordingly, the financial results of this business are not reflected in the financial statements included in this report on Form 10-K. They will be included with our results beginning with the first quarter of 2003. Eldor's consumer business is a leading supplier of flyback transformers to the European television industry.        Similarly, AMI Doduco has made a number of recent acquisitions. In January 2001, AMI Doduco acquired the electrical contact and materials business of Engelhard-CLAL, a manufacturer of electrical contacts, wire and strip contact materials and related products. Generally, AMI Doduco's acquisitions have been driven by our strategy of expanding our product and geographical market presence for electrical contact products.        Due to our integration of acquisitions and the interchangeable sources of net sales between existing and acquired operations, historically, we have not separately tracked the net sales of an acquisition after the date of the transaction.        Recent Cost Reduction Programs. During 1999 and 2000, the electronic components industries served by Pulse were characterized by unprecedented growth. Beginning in late 2000 and continuing all during 2001, however, the opposite trend was experienced as these industries experienced a severe worldwide contraction and many of our customers canceled orders and decreased their level of business activity as a result of lower demand for their end products. Our manufacturing business model at Pulse has a very high variable cost component due to the labor-intensity of many processes. This allows us to quickly change our capacity based on market demand. Just as we expanded capacity during 1999 and 2000, we reduced capacity during 2001 and 2002. While the electrical contact industry served by AMI Doduco is generally less dependent on volatile technology markets, it too was negatively impacted by general economic trends as reflected in slower overall construction spending, and reduced capital spending. AMI Doduco has a higher fixed cost component of manufacturing activity than Pulse, as it is more capital intensive. Therefore, AMI Doduco is unable to contract its capacity as quickly as Pulse in response to market demand, although significant actions have been taken to align AMI Doduco's capacity with current market demand. In response to the decline in demand for our products, we implemented a succession of cost reduction initiatives and programs, summarized as follows:        In 2002, we announced the closure of our production facility in the Philippines. The production at this facility was transferred to other Pulse facilities in Asia. We recorded charges of $3.8 million for this plant closing, comprised of $1.4 million for severance and related payments and $2.4 million for asset writedowns. The majority of this accrual was utilized by the end of 2002. We also adopted other restructuring plans during 2002. In this regard, we recorded provisions of $6.0 million for personnel reductions. Approximately 800 personnel were terminated in 2002 and substantially all of the employee severance and related payments in connection with these actions were completed as of December 27, 2002. An additional provision of $7.0 million was recorded in 2002 related to asset writedowns. These assets were primarily Asian-based production equipment that became idle in 2002. The remaining cost basis of the assets has been reclassified from fixed assets to assets held for sale in the balance sheet as of December 27, 2002.        During 2001, we announced the closure of our production facilities in Thailand and Malaysia. The production at these two facilities was transferred to other Pulse facilities in Asia. We recorded charges of $3.6 million for these plant closings, comprised of $2.5 million for severance and related payments and $1.1 million for other exit costs. The majority of this accrual was utilized by the end of 2002. We also adopted other restructuring plans during 2001. In this regard, provisions of $6.4 million were recorded during 2001. Approximately 3,500 manufacturing personnel primarily in Asia, and approximately 200 support personnel in North America and Europe were terminated. Approximately 75% of all of the employee severance and related payments in connection with these actions were completed as of December 28, 2001. Approximately $2.3 million of the provision remained as of December 28, 2001 for severance payments and related expenses which were paid in 2002. An additional $0.7 million remained accrued at December 28, 2001 for other exit costs at primarily Thailand and Malaysia. Termination costs for employees at our Thailand and Malaysian facilities have been included in the separate provisions for exiting those facilities. In addition to these terminations, headcount was reduced by approximately 12,300 additional personnel, net of new hires, during fiscal 2001 through voluntary employee attrition and involuntary workforce reductions primarily at manufacturing facilities in the PRC where severance payments are not necessary. In addition, a charge of $3.5 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2001 to write-down the value of certain Pulse fixed assets to their disposal value.                                    Page 19 of 62         In 2000, AMI Doduco recorded a $5.5 million provision for restructuring initiatives due to a reduction in employment levels by approximately 120 people, primarily in Germany. We provided $3.7 million for employee severance and related payments, $0.9 million related to the impairment of certain assets and $0.9 million for other exit costs. Offsetting these costs was a gain of $1.4 million related to the sale of a non-strategic European product line and a $0.8 million gain related to an insurance settlement.        As a result of our continuing focus on both economic and operating profit, we will continue to aggressively size both Pulse and AMI Doduco so that costs are minimized while we wait for the recovery in demand and pursue additional growth opportunities. The amounts of additional charges will depend on specific actions taken. The actions taken over the past two years such as plant closures, asset impairments and reduction in personnel worldwide have resulted in the elimination of a variety of costs. The majority of these costs represent the annual salaries and benefits of terminated employees, both those directly related to manufacturing and those providing selling, general and administrative services. The eliminated costs also include depreciation savings from disposed equipment and the relocation of capacity to factories in lower cost countries, primarily the PRC. If incoming orders increase substantially, additional hiring may be necessary to expand capacity. However, we do not anticipate requiring additional capacity in the foreseeable future.        We recorded pre-tax inventory provisions in cost of sales of $2.2 million and $20.3 million for the years ended December 27, 2002 and December 28, 2001, respectively. The amounts were determined by comparing quantities on-hand to actual historical usage and forecasted demand. The inventory that was written off in 2001 was primarily raw materials and specific finished goods for several customers.        International Operations. An increasing percentage of our sales in recent years has been outside of the United States. As of December 27, 2002, we have operations in 9 countries and we have significant net sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 27, 2002, 68.7% of our net sales were outside of the U.S. For the year ended December 28, 2001, 64.9% of our net sales were to customers outside of the U.S. Changing exchange rates often impact our financial results and the analysis of our period-over-period results. This is particularly true of movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. AMI Doduco's European sales are denominated primarily in euro. A portion of Pulse's European sales are also denominated in euros. However, the proportion at Pulse is less than it is at AMI Doduco. As a result of this and other factors and prior to the acquisition of Eldor, Pulse used the U.S. dollar as its functional currency in Europe while AMI Doduco uses the euro. For the acquired Eldor operations, Pulse uses the euro as its functional currency. The use of different functional currencies creates different financial effects. The euro was 5.5% stronger, on average, relative to the U.S. dollar, for the year ended December 27, 2002 versus the comparable prior-year period. As a result, AMI Doduco's euro-denominated sales resulted in higher dollar sales upon translation for our U.S. consolidated financial statements. We also experienced a positive translation adjustment to equity in the 2002 period because our investment in AMI Doduco's European operations was worth more in U.S. dollars. At Pulse, we incurred foreign currency gains as euro denominated assets and liabilities were remeasured to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes during 2002. If an increasing percentage of our sales are denominated in non-U.S. currencies, it could increase our exposure to currency fluctuations. The impact of exchange rate differences on AMI Doduco's European sales will be partially offset by the impact on our expenses and bank borrowings in Europe, all of which are also denominated in euros. Despite Pulse's significant presence in Asia, the vast majority of our revenues from customers in Asia are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, Pulse has less exposure than AMI Doduco to sales fluctuations caused by currency fluctuations.        In order to reduce our exposure resulting from currency fluctuations, we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts and/or currency options. These contracts guarantee a predetermined range of exchange rates at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. As of December 27, 2002, we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding to sell forward approximately 46.5 million of euro in order to hedge intercompany loans. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts and currency options, we consider the amount of sales, purchases and net assets or liabilities denominated in local currencies, the type of currency, and the costs associated with the contracts.        Precious Metals. AMI Doduco uses silver, as well as other precious metals, in manufacturing some of its electrical contacts, contact materials and contact subassemblies. Historically, we have leased or held these materials through consignment arrangements with our suppliers. Leasing and consignment costs have been typically below the costs to borrow funds to purchase the metals and these arrangements eliminate the fluctuations in the market price of owned precious metal. AMI Doduco's terms of sale generally allow us to charge customers for the market value of silver on the day after we deliver the silver bearing product to the customer. Thus far we have been successful in managing the costs associated with our precious metals. While limited amounts are purchased for use in production,                                    Page 20 of 62   the majority of our precious metal inventory continues to be leased or held on consignment. If our leasing/consignment fees increase significantly in a short period of time, and we are unable to recover these increased costs through higher sale prices, a negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity may result. Leasing/consignment fee increases are caused by increases in interest rates or increases in the price of the consigned material. See additional discussion in note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.        Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in high-tax jurisdictions such as Germany and the income earned in low-tax jurisdictions, particularly in Asia. This mix of income can vary significantly from one period to another. We have benefited over recent years from favorable offshore tax treatments. However, we may not be able to take advantage of similar benefits in the future. Developing countries and, in particular, the People's Republic of China, may change their tax policies at any time.        We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $307.6 million of our non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings (as calculated for income tax purposes) as of December 27, 2002, as per Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes - Special Areas. Such earnings include pre-acquisition earnings of foreign entities acquired through stock purchases, and are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. Unrecognized deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings are estimated to be approximately $93.7 million. Where excess cash has accumulated in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and it is advantageous for tax reasons, subsidiary earnings may be remitted.  Results of Operations     Year ended December 27, 2002 compared to the year ended December 28, 2001        Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended December 27, 2002 decreased $67.9 million, or 14.3%, to $406.4 million from $474.2 million for the year ended December 28, 2001. Our sales decline from the comparable period last year was attributable primarily to declining average selling prices, especially in Pulse's power conversion and telecom markets, and the precipitous global downturn in markets served by Pulse that began late in 2000, as a large portion of the strong sales in the first quarter of 2001 were for products ordered in 2000. Factors contributing to the downturn included declining capital expenditures by end-users and subsequent excess inventory levels. This downturn was experienced primarily in Pulse's networking and telecommunications markets on a worldwide basis, particularly in North America and Europe. Offsetting the sales declines in 2002 are the full year results of acquisitions completed in 2001.        Pulse's net sales decreased $48.7 million, or 19.2%, to $204.6 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 from $253.3 million for the year ended December 28, 2001. Although Pulse's sales were fairly consistent in the last nine months of 2002 and 2001, Pulse's sales were significantly lower in the first quarter of 2002 compared to the first quarter of 2001. The majority of Pulse sales during the quarter ended March 30, 2001 were for products ordered in 2000, before the dramatic market slowdown began. During the first quarter of 2001, new order rates declined and significant customer order cancellations occurred. Average selling prices also declined throughout 2002 compared to 2001, especially in Pulse's power conversion and telecom markets. Net sales in 2002 also include full year results of Grupo ECM and Excelsus sales, whereas 2001 included only sales derived from Grupo ECM and Excelsus since the date of their acquisition in March and August 2001, respectively.        AMI Doduco's net sales decreased $19.1 million, or 8.7%, to $201.8 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 from $220.9 million for the year ended December 28, 2001. Although AMI Doduco's sales were fairly consistent in the last nine months of 2002 and 2001 respectively, AMI Doduco's sales were significantly lower in the first quarter of 2002 compared to the first quarter of 2001. Sales in the 2002 period reflect very weak European markets, offset somewhat by a stronger average euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate on a year-over-year basis. Demand in North American markets was also lower throughout 2002 versus 2001, although the decline was not as severe as in Europe. The lower worldwide manufacturing activity in 2002 resulted in lower net sales primarily from customers in the commercial and industrial machinery, non-residential construction, and appliance industries in 2002.        Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales decreased $49.8 million, or 13.9%, to $309.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 from $359.7 million for the year ended December 28, 2001. This decrease was due to a decrease in net sales in 2002 and a reduction in inventory write-offs of $18.1 million, from $20.3 million in 2001 versus $2.2 million in 2002. Our consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 27, 2002 was 23.8% compared to 24.2% for the year ended December 28, 2001. Since the Pulse gross profit as a percentage of sales is typically higher than that of AMI Doduco, our consolidated gross margin in 2002 was negatively affected by:                                    Page 21 of 62         o     a mix of net sales weighted more heavily by AMI Doduco on a relative             basis,        o     a trend towards higher priced products with even higher costs for             certain Pulse products, such as filtered connectors replacing             discrete components, and        o     average per unit selling price declines for other Pulse products.  There were also manufacturing inefficiencies at both Pulse and AMI Doduco due to under-utilization of capacity as a result of the market downturn. These factors more than offset the positive impact of our restructuring initiatives.        Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 27, 2002 decreased $9.6 million, or 9.7%, to $89.3 million, or 22.0% of net sales, from $98.8 million, or 20.8% net of sales for the year ended December 28, 2001. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 was due primarily to actions that we took to reduce costs and tighten spending controls. In addition, selling expenses, which are largely variable with net sales, decreased $2.0 million from 2001 to 2002. Administrative expenses decreased by $5.8 million, due largely to lower headcount in the U.S. and lower incentive awards, offset somewhat by higher expenses related to our restricted stock plan in 2002. Research, development and engineering expense decreased by $2.4 million, due largely to consolidation of research facilities.        Research, development and engineering expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. For the years ended December 27, 2002 and December 28, 2001, RD&E by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):                                                       2002        2001                                                   -------     -------        Pulse                                       $13,892     $16,026       Percentage of segment sales                     6.8%        6.3%        AMI Doduco                                  $ 3,903     $ 4,155       Percentage of segment sales                     1.9%        1.9%        Although 2002 had been characterized by cost reduction activities and lower sales levels, particularly at Pulse, we largely avoided spending cuts in the RD&E area, as we believe that future demand in the electronic components markets will be driven by next-generation products. Design and development activities with our OEM customers continued at an aggressive pace during 2002. The reduced expense in RD&E in 2002 was primarily attributable to facility consolidation.        Interest. Net interest expense was $0.1 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 compared to $1.4 million of net interest income for the year ended December 28, 2001. This decrease was due to significantly lower yields on invested cash, somewhat offset by lower borrowing costs attributable to lower average outstanding debt in 2002. We incurred debt of approximately $74.0 million in connection with the acquisition of Excelsus in August 2001. Some of this debt remained outstanding until April 2002, when the balance was retired with proceeds from our follow-on offering. Invested cash balances increased by $62.8 million from year end 2001, due primarily to 2002 follow-on offering proceeds of $134.7 million less debt repayments of $75.3 million, coupled with an intense focus on cash and working capital management throughout 2002.        Our current credit facility, which was entered into on June 20, 2001, has variable interest rates. Accordingly, interest expense may increase if the rates associated with, or the amounts borrowed under, our credit facility move higher during subsequent quarters. We may use interest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates; however, we have not used any such instruments to date. At December 27, 2002, there were no borrowings under our facility.        Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate in the form of a benefit for the year ended December 27, 2002 was 30.8% compared to 51.0% for the year ended December 28, 2001. The lower tax rate in 2002 was the result of a higher weighting of Pulse taxable income versus AMI Doduco, as Pulse generally operates in lower tax jurisdictions than AMI Doduco. There was also a higher level of non-deductible restructuring charges incurred in 2001 versus 2002. Specifically, plant shut-down costs and severance expenses were incurred in certain low-tax jurisdictions or countries where we have current losses or discontinuing operations. In such countries, we expect to have no future income to offset such charges, resulting in little or no income tax benefit.                                    Page 22 of 62         Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change. During 2002, we recorded a cumulative effective of accounting change of $15.7 million, net of income tax benefit, upon adoption of SFAS 142. This charge was attributable to impairment of AMI Doduco goodwill.        Unusual and Infrequent Items. During 2002, we recorded a charge of $32.1 million, less a related $12.8 million income tax benefit, attributable to a write down of the Excelsus trade name acquired by Pulse. The trade name impairment charge was triggered by the combined effect of reorganizing Pulse into product line based organization and updated forecast for DSL microfilters. A total of $1.9 million was also recognized as unusual and infrequent income in 2002, attributable to the favorable outcome of certain legal matters. Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains additional information regarding restructuring charges recorded in 2002.  Year ended December 28, 2001 compared to the year ended December 29, 2000        Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended December 28, 2001 decreased $190.2 million, or 28.6%, to $474.2 million from $664.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2000. Our sales decline from the comparable period last year was attributable primarily to the precipitous global downturn in markets served by Pulse that began late in 2000. Factors contributing to the downturn included declining capital expenditures by end-users and subsequent excess inventory levels. This downturn was experienced in Pulse's networking, telecommunications and power conversion markets on a worldwide basis, particularly in North America and Europe.        Pulse's net sales decreased $185.5 million, or 42.3%, to $253.3 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 from $438.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2000. Pulse's sales were significantly lower in 2001 than in 2000 as new order rates declined and significant customer order cancellations occurred. Net sales in 2001 include sales derived from our acquisitions of Grupo ECM and Excelsus since the date of their acquisition in March and August 2001, respectively.        AMI Doduco's net sales decreased $4.7 million, or 2.1%, to $220.9 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 from $225.6 million for the year ended December 29, 2000. Sales in the 2001 period reflect strong European markets and contributions from the Engelhard-CLAL operations, acquired in early January 2001. However, these positive factors were offset by a slowdown in North American manufacturing activity during the year ended December 28, 2001, and to a lesser extent, a decline in the average euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. The lower manufacturing activity resulted in lower net sales primarily from customers in the commercial and industrial machinery, telecommunications and appliance industries.        Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales decreased $50.2 million, or 12.2%, to $359.7 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 from $409.9 million for the year ended December 29, 2000. This decrease was due to a decrease in net sales. Our consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 28, 2001 was 24.1% compared to 38.3% for the year ended December 29, 2000. Since the Pulse gross profit as a percentage of sales is typically higher than that of AMI Doduco, our consolidated gross margin in 2001 was negatively affected by:        o     a mix of net sales weighted more heavily by AMI Doduco on a relative             basis,        o     manufacturing inefficiencies at both Pulse and AMI Doduco due to             under-utilization of capacity as a result of the market downturn,             and        o     provisions for slow moving inventory at Pulse due to business             slowdown.        These factors more than offset the positive impact of our restructuring initiatives.        Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 28, 2001 decreased $32.3 million, or 24.6%, to $98.8 million, or 20.8% of net sales, from $131.1 million, or 19.7% net of sales for the year ended December 29, 2000. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2001 was due primarily to actions that we took to reduce costs and tighten spending controls. In addition, selling expenses, which are largely variable with net sales, decreased $3.1 million from 2000 to 2001. Administrative expenses decreased by $30.2 million, due largely to reduced headcount and lower incentive awards and lower expenses related to our restricted stock plan in 2001. These decreases were partially offset by higher research, development and engineering expenses, which increased by $1.0 million from 2001. The underlying expense for incentive awards is primarily variable and dependent upon our overall financial performance regarding incentive plan targets, primarily the achievement of economic profit and net operating profit objectives. These targets, which were set in December of 2000, were not achieved, and consequently, except for a small payment by AMI Doduco in the first quarter of 2001, no cash incentives were paid to executives. These incentive awards were $0.5 million in 2001 compared to $9.4 million in 2000. Expenses associated with stock-based compensation plans                                    Page 23 of 62   including the restricted stock plan were also significantly lower in 2001 versus the year ended December 29, 2000, due to a lower average share price of our common stock throughout 2001 compared to 2000. These expenses were approximately $1.2 million in 2001 compared to $7.0 million in 2000.        Research, development and engineering expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. For the years ended December 28, 2001 and December 29, 2000, RD&E by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):                                                   2001            2000                                               -------         -------        Pulse                                   $16,026         $15,748       Percentage of segment sales                 6.3%            3.6%        AMI Doduco                              $ 4,155         $ 4,430       Percentage of segment sales                 1.9%            2.0%        Although 2001 was characterized by cost reduction activities and much lower sales levels, particularly at Pulse, we largely avoided spending cuts in the RD&E area as we believe that the recovery in the electronic components markets will be driven by next-generation products. Design and development activities with our OEM customers continued at an aggressive pace during 2001.        Interest. Net interest income was $1.4 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 29, 2000. Invested cash balances remained essentially consistent with the year ended December 29, 2000, due to the intense focus on cash management throughout 2001. This resulted in preservation of average cash balances throughout 2001. Outstanding debt increased during the year ended December 28, 2001 due primarily to $74.0 million that was incurred in connection with the acquisition of Excelsus in August 2001, resulting in increased interest expense.        Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 28, 2001 was 51.0% compared to 19.2% for the year ended December 29, 2000. The higher tax rate in 2001 resulted from the non-deductibility of certain restructuring charges incurred in 2001. Specifically, plant shut-down costs and severance expenses were incurred in low-tax jurisdictions or countries where we have current losses or discontinued operations. In such countries, we expect to have no future income to offset such charges, resulting in little or no income tax benefit. In addition, a higher proportion of income was earned in high-tax jurisdictions.  Liquidity and Capital Resources        Working capital including cash and cash equivalents as of December 27, 2002 was $238.6 million compared to $189.3 million as of December 28, 2001. This increase was primarily due to proceeds from our follow-on offering, net of debt repayments, offset by higher current installments of long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents, which is included in working capital, increased from $142.3 million as of December 28, 2001 to $205.1 million as of December 27, 2002.        Net cash flows from operating activities was $20.8 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 and $62.7 million in 2001, a decrease of $41.9 million. The lower cash flow from operations in 2002 was primarily driven by decreasing net earnings. However, the lower earnings were partially offset by decreased working capital requirements and aggressive cash management actions that we took in response to the slowdown. A significant decrease in Pulse's net sales during the year ended December 28, 2001 compared to 2000, caused a significant decrease in accounts receivable in 2001.        Capital expenditures were $5.8 million during the year ended December 27, 2002 and $13.2 million in 2001. The level of capital expenditures decreased from the year ended December 28, 2001, due to tight spending controls and lower Pulse capacity needs resulting from lower sales. We significantly reduced our capital spending in 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. Our spending in 2003 will depend on market demand and capacity requirements. We make capital expenditures to expand production capacity and to improve our operating efficiency. We plan to continue making such expenditures in the future.        Cash used for acquisitions was $6.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 and $115.5 million for 2001. The 2002 spending was for an additional equity investment in Full Rise Electronics, Co., Ltd.. We exercised our option to expand our investment in FRE on July 27, 2002, with an additional investment of approximately $6.7                                    Page 24 of 62   million which increased our total investment to $20.9 million. The spending in 2001 included the acquisition of Excelsus for approximately $85.9 million in August 2001. On January 9, 2003 we acquired Eldor High Tech Wire Wound Components S.r.L. for 81.6 million euros, or $84.5 million in U.S. dollar equivalent, plus related acquisition costs and expenses. The source of funding for the purchase was cash on hand. As the purchase price was denominated in euro, we exchanged in a spot market transaction, $87.1 million for 84.1 million euro on December 30, 2002. The additional funding of 2.5 million euro, in excess of the purchase price, was expected to be used to fund working capital requirements, as Eldor was purchased net of existing cash. We may acquire other businesses or product lines to expand our breadth and scope of operations.        We paid dividends of $1.1 million for the year ended December 27, 2002 and $4.5 million for the year ended December 28, 2001. We received proceeds of $1.3 million during the year ended December 27, 2002 and $6.5 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 from the sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan. After paying a dividend on January 25, 2002 to shareholders of record on January 4, 2002, we discontinued our regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings to finance the growth of our business.        As of December 27, 2002, we have no outstanding borrowings under our existing three-year revolving credit agreement. We entered into this credit agreement on June 20, 2001 providing for $225.0 million of credit capacity. Following the conclusion of our follow-on equity offering in April 2002, we voluntarily reduced the size of this credit facility to a maximum of $175.0 million in order to reduce commitment fees and to size the facility to estimated future needs given cash on hand. We also amended the minimum net worth threshold from $275.0 million to $259.3 million as a result of goodwill impairment charge recorded in the three months ended March 29, 2002. The amended facility consists of:        o     an aggregate U.S. dollar-based revolving line of credit in the             principal amount of up to $175.0 million including individual             sub-limits of:              -     a British pounds sterling-based or euro-based revolving line                   of credit in the principal amount of up to the U.S. dollar                   equivalent of $75.0 million; and              -     a multicurrency facility providing for the issuance of letters                   of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed the U.S. dollar                   equivalent of $10.0 million.  The amounts outstanding under the credit facility in total may not exceed $175.0 million. Outstanding borrowings are limited to a maximum of three times our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, (EBITDA) on a rolling twelve-month basis.        The credit facility also contains covenants requiring maintenance of minimum net worth, maximum debt to EBITDA ratio, minimum interest expense coverage, capital expenditure limitations, and other customary and normal provisions. We are in compliance with all such covenants.        We pay a facility fee, irrespective of whether there are outstanding borrowings or not, which ranges from 0.275% to 0.450% of the total commitment, depending on our EBITDA. The interest rate for each currency's borrowing will be a combination of the base rate for that currency plus a credit margin spread. The base rate is different for each currency. It is LIBOR or prime rate for U.S. dollars, Euro-LIBOR for euros, and a rate approximating sterling LIBOR for British pounds. The credit margin spread is the same for each currency and is 0.850% to 1.425% depending on our debt to EBITDA ratio. Each of our domestic subsidiaries with net worth equal to or greater than $5 million has agreed to guarantee all obligations incurred under the credit facility.        We also have obligations outstanding under two term loan agreements. The first is with Baden-Wurttembergische Bank for borrowing under two loans, each in the amount of approximately 5.1 million euro, both due in June 2003. The second is with Sparkasse Pforzheim, for the borrowing of approximately 5.1 million euro, and is due in August 2009.        We had three standby letters of credit outstanding at December 27, 2002 in the aggregate amount of $2.5 million securing transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business.                                    Page 25 of 62         As of December 27, 2002, future payments related to contractual obligations are as follows (in thousands):                                                          Amounts due by period                                                                            4 to 5                                 Total   Less than 1 year   2 to 3 years     years    Thereafter                                 -----   ----------------   ------------    ------    ----------                  Long-term debt          $16,348            $10,667         $  242    $  172        $5,267       Operating leases         22,329              7,535          7,971     2,680         4,143                               -------            -------         ------    ------        ------                               $38,677            $18,202         $8,213    $2,852        $9,410         We also have commercial commitments as of December 27, 2002 of $43.5 million due under precious metal consignment-type leases and $2.5 million of standby letters of credit securing transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business. We believe that our existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy these contractual obligations and commercial commitments.        We believe that the combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and, if necessary, additional borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements in the short-term and long-term. In addition, we may use internally generated funds or borrowings, or additional equity offerings for acquisitions of suitable businesses or assets.        With the exception of approximately $10.0 million of retained earnings as of December 27, 2002 in the PRC that are restricted in accordance with Section 58 of the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprises Law, substantially all retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions. The amount restricted in accordance with the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprise Law is for employee welfare programs and is applicable to all foreign investment enterprises doing business in the PRC. The restriction applies to 10% of our net earnings in the PRC, limited to 50% of the total capital invested in the PRC. We have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and none are foreseen. However, foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which some foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash movements from time to time. The retained earnings in other countries represent a material portion of our assets. We expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years will be abroad. If these earnings were brought back to the United States, significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the United States as several countries in which we operate have rates significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Additionally, we have not accrued U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings indefinitely invested abroad. We have also been granted special tax incentives in other countries such as the PRC. This favorable situation could change if these countries were to increase rates or revoke the special tax incentives, or if we were to discontinue manufacturing operations in these countries. This could have a material unfavorable impact on our net income and cash position.  New Accounting Pronouncements        In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46"). FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. We are required to adopt the provisions of FIN 46 for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. Adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our revenue, operating results, financial position, or liquidity.        In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure, an amendment to Statement No. 123 ("SFAS 148"). SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS 123"), by requiring prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements, about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We intend to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, as of the beginning of our fiscal year in 2003. We will use the prospective method of adoption, which recognizes expense for all employee awards granted, modified or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our revenue, operating results or liquidity, and we expect net expense after related tax benefits to lower diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.01 per share in fiscal 2003.                                    Page 26 of 62         In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees and Indebtedness of Others ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN 45 also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We are required to adopt the provisions of FIN 45 on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, although the related disclosure requirements are effective immediately. We have not issued any guarantees for performance of third parties. Accordingly, adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our revenue, operating results, financial position or liquidity.        In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities ("SFAS 146"). SFAS 146 superceded the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity, ("EITF 94-3") The principal difference between SFAS 146 and EITF 94-3 is that SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. As such, under SFAS 146, an entity's commitment to a plan by itself, does not create a present obligation meeting the definition of a liability. SFAS 146 also established fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS for all exit or disposal activities initiated after December 15, 2002. The impact of this standard on our operating results will depend on the level and nature of restructuring activities that we initiate in 2003 and beyond.        In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS 143") which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or) normal use of the assets. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss on settlement will be recognized. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 during the three months ending March 28, 2003. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our net sales, operating results, financial position, or liquidity.  Item 7a Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk        Our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt, are exposed to changes in interest rates in both the U.S. and abroad. We invest our excess cash in short-term, investment grade interest bearing securities. We generally limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extent practical. Our board has adopted policies relating to these risks, and the audit committee of the board continually monitors compliance with these policies.        Our existing credit facility has variable interest rates. Accordingly, interest expense may increase if we borrow and if the rates associated with our borrowings move higher. In addition, we may pursue additional or alternative financing for growth opportunities in one or both segments. We may use interest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates. However, we have not used any of these instruments to date.                                    Page 27 of 62         The table below presents principal amounts in U.S. dollars (or equivalent U.S. dollars with respect to non-U.S. denominated debt) and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our foreign debt obligations. The column captioned "Approximate Fair Value" sets forth the carrying value of our long-term debt as of December 27, 2002, which approximates our fair value at such date after taking into consideration current rates offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. We do not hold or issue financial instruments or derivative financial instruments for trading purposes (dollars in thousands):                                                                                                              Approx.

However, we conduct business in various foreign currencies, including those of emerging market countries in Asia and well-developed European countries. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily forward exchange contracts in connection with fair value hedges, to manage foreign currency risks. In accordance with SFAS 133, gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognized in income along with adjustments of carrying amounts of the hedged items. Therefore, all of our forward exchange contracts are marked-to-market, and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income. These contracts guarantee a predetermined rate of exchange at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. We believe there are two potential risks of holding these instruments. The first is that the foreign currency being hedged could move in a direction which could create a better economic outcome than if hedging had not taken place. The second risk is that the counterparty to a currency hedge defaults on our obligations. We reduce the risk of counterparty default by entering into relatively short-term hedges with well capitalized and highly rated banks. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts, we consider the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies, the type of currency and the costs associated with the contracts.
