Item 7   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations  Introduction           This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, as well as other sections of this report, contain certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please refer to pages 9 through 12 of this report for a description of "forward-looking statements" and factors that may affect future results.           We are making the statements below to inform our shareholders of our general financial condition and our results of operations. We are not trying to influence investors to buy or sell our securities.  Business Overview           Please refer to Part I, Item I for a description of our continuing businesses and strategic initiatives.           During the first quarter of 1996, we sold the assets of our Products Division which produced currency counters and dispensers. In June 1997, we sold the remainder of our Test & Measurement Products Segment, which manufactured material testing systems, force measurement products and weighing devices. We sold these businesses because they did not fit within our core competencies and did not offer us opportunities to create significant shareholder value. The Test & Measurement Products Segment is reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.           We believe that the investments, divestiture and strategies described in Part I, Item I and in the preceding paragraph have positioned us for future growth and the creation of additional shareholder value.  Liquidity and Capital Resources           Working capital at December 31, 1998 was $102.3 million, an increase of $14.7 million from the working capital of $87.6 million at December 31, 1997. Worldwide, cash on hand at December 31, 1998 was $50.6 million.           We believe that the combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and, if necessary, additional borrowings under our credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may use internally generated funds and additional borrowings for acquisitions of suitable businesses or assets.           Cash Flows from Operating Activities           Cash flow from operations was $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This represents an increase of approximately $26.0 million from 1997.                                     Page 15 of 64     Earnings from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortization and deferred tax expense, accounted for approximately $11.3 million of the increase. Also reflected in the year-to-year increase was the fact that 1997 operating cash flows were negatively affected by an increase in accounts receivable at AMI Doduco's European operation, since we did not acquire accounts receivable as part of the Doduco acquisition in late 1996. Our 1998 acquisitions involved primarily the purchase of stock, under which we assumed operating assets and current liabilities. Our 1998 changes in assets and liabilities are net of the effect of our acquisition of Metales, FEE and GTI/Valor.           Cash Flows from Investing Activities           Cash used by investing activities was $62.8 million during 1998. We used approximately $15.6 million of cash to acquire FEE and certain operating assets of Metales. We used approximately $34.0 million to acquire all the outstanding shares of GTI. We also made cash payments of $1.2 million for previously accrued expenses related to the acquisition of Nortel's magnetic components business. As part of our 1998 acquisitions, we acquired approximately $8.0 million of cash.           Cash payments for capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, totaled approximately $20.4 million, or about 4.6% of net sales during 1998 and exceeded overall depreciation by about $7.5 million. We make capital expenditures to expand production capacity and to improve our operating efficiency. We expect to continue making such expenditures.           With the exception of approximately $6.2 million of retained earnings in China which are restricted by PRC regulations, substantially all retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions. We have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and none are foreseen. However, foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which some foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash movements from time to time. The retained earnings in other countries represent a material portion of our assets. We expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years will be abroad. If such earnings were brought back to the United States, significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the United States. This could have a material unfavorable impact on our net income and cash position.           Cash Flows from Financing Activities           During 1998 we borrowed $44.2 million and repaid approximately $25.5 million of debt. The net incremental borrowings of approximately $18.7 million were used to acquire all the outstanding shares of GTI.                                      Page 16 of 64              In November, we entered into an agreement with a syndicate of banks increasing our line of credit to $125.0 million. The increase in available credit provides us with additional financial flexibility. The facility is a multi-currency revolving credit line with a variable interest rate based, at our option, on either the prime rate or the relevant LIBOR rate. The facility terminates in June of 2000 and, because of various tax reasons, is secured by a pledge of the stock of certain of our domestic subsidiaries.           In July, we entered into a DM10.0 million unsecured loan facility with a German bank in order to convert a portion of our outstanding credit from a variable-rate revolver to a fixed-rate term debt. This loan is for a term of five years, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.57% and is non-amortizing.           At December 31, 1998, we had approximately $116.4 million of unused lines of credit from banks.           We have paid dividends for the last 91 consecutive quarters.  Our  dividends in 1998 were $3.8 million.  We expect to continue making quarterly dividend payments for the foreseeable future.           Foreign Currency Effects           During 1998, we did not experience any significant foreign currency gains or losses. We experienced a positive translation adjustment to equity due to the strengthening of the Deutsche mark and the French franc against the U.S. dollar in the third and fourth quarters. The currency movements resulted in our investments in the MCS's European operations and in the acquired FEE operations being worth more in U.S. dollars than they were prior to the strengthening. This increase in U.S. dollar value is reflected as an adjustment to equity.           We transact a significant amount of sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, changing exchange rates often impact our financial results. This is particularly true of movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro because AMI Doduco's European sales are denominated primarily in the euro. In the future, it is possible that an increasing percentage of our sales will be denominated in non-U.S. currencies. This would increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.           During 1997, currencies in several of the countries where we manufacture and/or sell products devalued significantly relative to the U.S. dollar. The majority of our sales originating in those countries, as well as the majority of raw materials purchased, are denominated in U.S. dollars. Expenses in those countries, particularly labor and overhead, are denominated and paid in local currencies which devalued against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the devaluation of these local currencies favorably affected our profitability by reducing the manufacturing costs paid in those currencies.           Please see the section titled "Foreign Currency Risk" under Item 7A of this report for a description of our strategies to manage foreign currency risks.                                     Page 17 of 64      New Accounting Pronouncements           In June of 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. This standard is effective for quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our operating results or liquidity. The impact of this standard on our balance sheet will depend on the amount of hedging activity outstanding on the date of adoption.  Results of Operations           Our results from continuing operations for 1998, 1997 and 1996 are as follows(1). Amounts are in thousands:                                                        Year Ended                                                        December 31,                                            1998            1997           1996                                             ----            ----           ---- Net sales:      Electronic Components               $218,876       $179,772       $142,791       Metallurgical Components             229,663        217,295        100,521                                           --------       --------       --------          Total                           $448,539       $397,067       $243,312                                           ========       ========       ========  Earnings before income taxes:      Electronic Components               $ 37,721       $ 30,865       $ 22,536       Metallurgical Components              15,695         14,888          4,983                                           --------       --------       --------          Operating profit                  53,416         45,753         27,519       Other income (expense), net           (1,073)         1,011           (316)                                          --------       --------       --------      Earnings from continuing        operations before income taxes    $ 52,343       $ 46,764       $ 27,203                                           ========       ========       ========     - ----------------------- (1) The results of the Test & Measurement Products Segment are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. The Products Division, which we sold during the first quarter of 1996, was included in the Test & Measurement Products Segment. The sale of the Products Division occurred prior to our decision to divest the entire segment, and the financial information for the division had not been separately reported in the 1996 financial statements. Accordingly, the gain on the sale of that division was included in income from continuing operations. The 1997 sales of the Test & Measurement Products Segment were approximately $11.8 million prior to the divestiture on June 4, 1997.                                      Page 18 of 64               Revenues           Our sales from continuing operations for 1998 increased by $51.5 million, or 13.0%, from 1997. We attribute the 1998 sales increase to:           *  the magnetic components business purchased from Northern Telecom in             late 1997;           *  operations of FEE and Metales since July 3, 1998;           *  operations of GTI since November 16, 1998; and           *  strong sales volume from AMI Doduco's European operations during the             first six months of 1998.           Our 1997 sales increased by $153.8 million, or 63.2%, from 1996 because the MCS results in 1997 included a full year of operating the European businesses obtained from Doduco GmbH in November 1996. Also, our electronic components operations benefited from strong customer demand in the local area network, telecommunications and computer markets.           Sales in our ECS increased by $39.1 million, or 21.8%, from 1997 to 1998. Recent acquisitions contributed to this increase in sales. These acquisitions included: the magnetic components business of Northern Telecom in late 1997, FEE in the third quarter of 1998 and GTI on November 16, 1998. In addition to the ECS's acquisitions, orders for our power conversion components were stronger in 1998 than in 1997.           Partially offsetting these positive sales factors was the worldwide softness in LAN component markets during the majority of 1998, in contrast to record levels of orders and shipments during the first nine months of 1997. From September through the end of 1998, the LAN market improved and contributed to ECS's fourth quarter revenues.           Order entry in the telecommunications markets was somewhat less than we projected for 1998 as some Asian infrastructure programs, particularly those undertaken by European equipment suppliers, remained temporarily on hold. Other telecommunications markets remained strong as the "cellular revolution" and the construction and upgrading of competing landline networks continued in Europe and North America.           The ECS's backlog at December 31, 1998 was approximately 2% higher than at the end of the third quarter and about equal to the end of 1997. Orders for acquired product lines accounted for the increase in backlog. However, we believe that backlog levels are much less reliable as a measure of near-term business activity than they were in previous years. This is particularly true in the ECS. Customers are adopting inventory management policies that change ordering patterns and reduce lead times. This trend accelerated in the fourth quarter of 1998 and we expect it to continue.           Sales in our MCS increased by $12.4 million, or 5.7%, from 1997 to 1998 due to:           *  operating certain assets acquired from Metales on July 3, 1998;                                     Page 19 of 64              *  stronger sales volume from the MCS's European operations during the             first six months of 1998; and           *  favorable 1998 economic conditions for the construction, automotive             and durable goods industries in North America and most of Western             Europe.           Sales in our MCS increased from 1997 despite various challenges during the year. Hurricane Georges caused substantial damage to our facilities and to customer facilities in Puerto Rico, with our plant in Puerto Rico being effectively shut down for approximately two weeks in late September.           The MCS's fourth-quarter revenues were affected by a decline in demand for industrial circuit breaker and motor control contacts in North America and for automotive contacts in Europe. Aside from the slowing in demand for contacts toward year-end, European automotive markets remained strong in the fourth quarter.           Cost of Sales           Our gross margin was 31.7% in 1998, a decrease from 32.2% in 1997 and even with 1996. Our gross margin was slightly lower than in 1997 primarily due to a slower LAN market and recent ECS acquisitions which were operating at lower margins than our existing business. Partially offsetting these factors were favorable exchange rates in the Far East.           In 1998, the ECS operated the former magnetic components business of Nortel for the full year and the former FEE business for six months. Components in both of these businesses had lower margins than our previously existing electronics business. Additionally, we incurred higher than anticipated one time third quarter costs related to completing the standardization of production activity reporting and conversion of information systems in the acquired Nortel businesses. Finally, we operated GTI for seven weeks of 1998. Although a significant percentage of GTI's business is providing components into the LAN market, GTI's margins are currently much lower than those realized by the ECS as a whole. Integration efforts in all of these businesses continue.           We define "production rationalization" as the movement of products to the optimum manufacturing facility while, at the same time, closing redundant facilities. The production rationalization phase of the Nortel acquisition is complete. The production rationalization phase of the FEE acquisition is well under way and we are in the process of rationalizing the GTI operations. We expect the production rationalization of GTI to result in GTI's former operations being consolidated into the ECS's existing facilities.           The MCS's 1998 gross margin was essentially unchanged from 1997. Sales mix and the continued integration of the various businesses in this segment positively impacted the 1998 gross margins. These positive factors were offset by:           *  the impact of Hurricane Georges on the Puerto Rico operation;           *  unabsorbed overhead during the transfer of production of certain             lines of business from Europe to the United States; and                                     Page 20 of 64                 *  costs associated with the integration of operating assets acquired             from Metales in July 1998.  The industries served by both segments remain characterized by aggressive competition and constant pressure on sales prices resulting from our customers' ongoing cost reduction activities.           Our gross margin in 1997 increased over 1996 as the ECS's margin improved due to an increase of sales into the LAN markets. This margin improvement more than offset the 1997 impact of the acquisition of AMI Doduco's European operations and the 1997 growth of the MCS, which generally has a lower gross margin than the ECS.           Operating Expenses           Our total selling, general and administrative expenses for 1998, 1997 and 1996 are as follows.  Amounts are in thousands:                                                           Year Ended                                                         December 31,                                               1998          1997          1996                                                ----          ----          ----      Selling, General & Administrative         Expenses                             $88,827       $82,264        $49,547       % of Net Sales                           19.8%         20.7%          20.4%           Selling, general and administrative spending has increased in dollar amounts since 1996. The increase reflects the higher spending required to support higher sales levels and an increasing international presence. This was especially true in 1997, which included a full year of operating results from AMI Doduco's European businesses.           As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses during 1998 were lower due to the absence of Netwave Technologies, Inc. Netwave was a product line dedicated to wireless LAN access. We sold this business at the end of 1997. Netwave required a high level of spending in 1997 and 1996 relative to its revenues. On the other hand, 1998 expenses related to integrating recent acquisitions partially offset the benefit of selling our interest in Netwave. Additionally, the MCS incurred one time operating expenses in 1998 for:           *  the implementation of its enterprise resource planning tool;           *  ongoing personnel recruitment efforts; and           *  restructuring our sales efforts in Europe.  We believe that these operating activities will benefit our profitability in the future.           We include research, development and engineering expenses in selling, general and administrative expenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. In 1998, RD&E expenses were $11.0 million for the ECS and $5.8 million for the                                      Page 21 of 64      MCS. The ECS amount compares to $10.6 in 1997 and $6.6 million in 1996. The comparable MCS amounts were $5.8 million in 1997 and $2.4 million in 1996.           Although ECS spending on RD&E increased only slightly over 1997, the 1997 amount included RD&E at Netwave. Excluding Netwave's high RD&E expenses in relation to its sales, the ECS's expenditures on RD&E actually increased significantly from the prior year. The ECS continues to invest in new technologies and related improvements to respond to technology changes. Neither segment anticipates any significant changes to RD&E efforts in 1999.           Interest           Net interest expense was approximately $1.2 million during 1998, compared with approximately $.1 million of net interest income during 1997. The 1997 interest income amount reflects a higher than customary level of funds invested in short-term deposit instruments. This high level of funds resulted from the cash received when we sold the Test & Measurement Products Segment on June 4, 1997. Also in 1998, we incurred interest expense on a higher level of debt, particularly following the GTI acquisition late in the year. Finally, interest incurred in connection with consigned precious metals that we hold for use in production was higher in 1998 than in 1997 or 1996. These rates were particularly high during the first part of 1998.           Please see the section titled "Interest Rate Risk" under Item 7A of this report for additional information regarding interest.           Income Taxes           Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations during 1998 was 36.4%. This compares to 37.8% in 1997 and 33.3% in 1996. Our effective tax rate has increased since 1996 as a result of additional taxable income from AMI Doduco's European operations. Countries in Europe, particularly Germany, have high tax rates compared to other countries in which we operate. The 1998 tax rate was lower than 1997 due to the availability of tax credits in Germany and the impact of operating GTI for seven weeks in 1998. These factors offset the expiration of the income tax holiday in the People's Republic of China at the beginning of 1998.           We have benefited over recent years from favorable offshore tax treatments; however, there are no assurances that such treatments will continue in the future. Developing countries and, in particular, the People's Republic of China, may change their tax policies at any time. In addition to income tax policies, we monitor developments relating to other business taxes.                                       Page 22 of 64     Other Issues           Precious Metal           The MCS uses silver, as well as other precious metals, in the manufacturing of electrical contacts, rivets and other products. Historically, we have leased or held these materials through consignment arrangements with our suppliers. Leasing and consignment costs have been substantially below the costs to borrow funds to purchase the metals. In addition, the risk of a decrease in the market price of owned precious metal can be substantial. As is sometimes the case, during the first quarter of 1998, and to a lesser extent in early 1999, the price of silver increased significantly. The associated leasing costs have also increased. The terms of sale within the MCS allow us to charge customers for the current market value of silver. However, leasing costs cannot always be recovered. Thus far we have been successful in managing the costs associated with our precious metals. While limited amounts were purchased during 1998 for use in production, the vast majority of our precious metal inventory continues to be leased or held on consignment. If our leasing/consignment fees increase significantly in a short period of time, and we are unable to recover these increased costs through higher sale prices, a negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity may result. We believe this risk is shared by all of our competitors.           Year 2000 Computer Issues           General           The popularly called "Year 2000" issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems revolve around whether computer systems will properly recognize date-sensitive information when the year changes to 2000. Information technology ("IT") and non-IT systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail. The Year 2000 problem is pervasive and complex, as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit value to 00.           Our IT systems include central business computing and ancillary business computing systems, payroll systems and manufacturing systems. Our non-IT systems, those with embedded technology such as microcontrollers, include time reporting systems, alarm and security systems, telecommunication systems, plant machinery controls and electronic data interfaces. We have analyzed the impact of the Year 2000 issues on our systems and are in the process of addressing the issues raised by our analysis.           Our products do not include date-sensitive software or embedded technology. As a result, we do not expect to experience product warranty or return issues relating to the Year 2000 problem.           State of Readiness           As a result of our decentralized segment structure and the diversified systems employed by each segment and the corporate location, the Year 2000 issue                                     Page 23 of 64      is being managed by each group separately. Oversight and status reviews are performed by corporate personnel and, ultimately, the audit committee and board of directors. Corporate, the ECS and the MCS are in varying stages of addressing Year 2000 issues. We have defined the stages of progress for Year 2000 readiness as follows: awareness, assessment, renovation, validation and implementation. Corporate and the ECS are in the implementation stage while the MCS is in the assessment and renovation stages.           Corporate           The IT systems at our corporate location are primarily purchased programs. Periodically, these programs are updated with new releases. As a result of these updates and discussions with vendors, we believe that internal IT systems used at the corporate location are Year 2000 ready in all material respects.           We maintain electronic interfaces with external vendors, including banks, insurance companies, employee benefit providers and many other parties. In addition, we are dependent on parties such as our transfer agent and the NYSE to provide for uninterrupted trading of our securities. Based on discussions with their personnel, we believe these highly regulated institutions are or will be Year 2000 ready, although we have received no such guarantees. We have requested Year 2000 readiness statements from these vendors. In the event that these parties experience Year 2000 problems, the consequences to us are unknown.           We believe that corporate non-IT systems are Year 2000 ready, although the use of non-IT systems at the corporate level is not critical to our operations.           ECS           In mid-1997, the ECS formed a working group to address Year 2000 issues facing this segment. All of the ECS's corporate applications were reviewed to determine whether to repair, re-engineer, replace, or retire each system. All recommended reprogramming steps to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been completed. In addition, the ECS completed compliance implementations and related testing for infrastructure-related issues with the operating systems, computer networks, and telecommunications equipment and services, as well as the ECS's facilities and security systems. To the extent problems develop, the ECS expects that its IT department, with the assistance of external consultants, will be able to address those problems on a timely basis.           Regarding the FEE acquisition, the ECS has completed an assessment of Year 2000 issues related to FEE's IT and non-IT systems. Year 2000 issues were identified and are currently being addressed by internal resources. Implementation of necessary changes and testing of those changes are expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 1999 without material expenditures.           Prior to our acquisition of GTI, GTI completed the installation of an enterprise resource planning system which addressed GTI's Year 2000 issues related to their information systems. Any potential Year 2000 issues related to                                      Page 24 of 64      GTI's facilities or non-IT systems will be addressed by our plans to integrate GTI's operations into our facilities, which we believe are Year 2000 ready.           The ECS is still in the process of contacting vendors and suppliers, including hardware, software, telecommunications, networking, security, data and service providers, regarding the Year 2000 readiness status of their companies and products. To the extent that a supplier is not able to become Year 2000 ready, alternative supply sources will be identified and contacted, and their Year 2000 readiness status verified within the next two quarters. The ECS expects that its major vendors or suppliers will be Year 2000 ready.           Aggregate external costs incurred to address Year 2000 issues within the ECS have approximated $350,000. About $250,000 of this amount was paid to consultants and expensed when incurred. The remainder of the costs related to accelerated purchases of licenses and software, and was capitalized in accordance with existing company policy. Future costs related to the ECS Year 2000 issues are expected to be immaterial to the ECS.           MCS           Motivated in part by the Year 2000 issue and issues related to the euro currency conversion, but more so by the need for managers to have access to real-time business data, the MCS is in the process of installing a worldwide enterprise resource planning system which is scheduled to be operational in the second quarter of 1999. We refer to the enterprise resource planning system as ERP. The MCS is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify, correct or reprogram and test both IT and non-IT systems for Year 2000 compliance. It is anticipated that all reprogramming efforts will be completed in a time period sufficient to allow for appropriate testing.           The ERP is expected to be installed and operational in Germany and the U.S. by the end of April of 1999. The project is on schedule and the vendor has warranted that the software is Year 2000 ready. This software is not unique to the MCS and is in use in many Fortune 1000 companies. The MCS is in the process of assessing the systems in Mexico to determine the extent of any Year 2000 issues, but any compliance issues are expected to be immaterial.           A Year 2000 readiness review of manufacturing systems is also under way. The MCS's manufacturing systems include furnace controls, computer integrated manufacturing systems, shop floor data collection and test equipment. Some of these systems include embedded systems. It is anticipated that any material Year 2000 problems will be identified and corrected by December of 1999 without material expense.           All remaining IT and non-IT systems are expected to be repaired, reprogrammed or replaced by the end of the first quarter of 1999. Excluding the costs of implementing the ERP system, the total costs -- incurred and to be incurred -- associated with addressing the Year 2000 issues within the MCS are estimated to be $150,000. Those costs are being expensed as incurred. The cost of implementing the ERP system is significant to us; however, such costs have been budgeted and approved in the ordinary course of business and are being expensed or capitalized in accordance with existing policy. While we expect                                      Page 25 of 64      that problems will develop from time to time during the course of the ERP change over, we do not believe that these problems will have a material adverse effect on our operations or that they necessarily will be Year 2000 related.           The MCS has formalized questionnaires and sent those to vendors requesting information regarding Year 2000 readiness. The MCS has received completed surveys from a number of its suppliers. The identification of alternative supply sources is our intended corrective action with regard to non-compliant suppliers.           Contingency Plans           As the corporate location and the ECS believe their aggressive action with respect to Year 2000 problems will mitigate material problems, overall contingency plans have not been developed.           In the event that there is a failure of the ERP system, MCS's contingency plans include reverting to existing financial systems that are Year 2000 ready. Other financial and non-financial applications would be run manually and problems would be addressed as identified.           Risks           The failure to correct a material Year 2000 problem could result in an interruption in, or failure of, certain normal business activities or operations. For example, if a utility company were unable to deliver power, or if a major vendor were unable to deliver product, the operations of the affected segment could be disrupted or even temporarily shut down. However, in each segment, our manufacturing facilities and locations are more geographically diverse than those of most of our competitors. This diversity provides a natural hedge against those Year 2000 problems which may affect a given supplier or utility. In the unlikely event that such failures occur, they could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Due to the general uncertainty of the Year 2000 problem, including the uncertainty of the Year 2000 readiness of third-party suppliers and customers, we are unable to determine with complete certainty at this time whether the consequences of Year 2000 failures will have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. Although there can be no assurance that we have identified and corrected, or will identify and correct, every Year 2000 problem existing in IT and non-IT systems, we believe that we have programs in place to identify and correct any such material problems and that our actions have significantly decreased the risks associated with the Year 2000 problem.           Euro Conversion           On January 1, 1999, 11 of the 15 member countries of the European Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro. We refer to the 11 countries as the participating countries and the participating countries' sovereign currencies as the legacy currencies. The euro now trades on currency exchanges and is available for non-cash transactions.                                      Page 26 of 64              The legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro between January 1, 1999 and July 1, 2002. During this transition period, public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or a legacy currency. Beginning January 1, 2002, the participating countries will issue new euro-denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions. By July 1, 2002, the participating countries will withdraw all bills and coins denominated in the legacy currencies, so that the legacy currencies no longer will be legal tender for any transactions. The conversion to the euro will then be complete.           We have developed plans to ensure, to the extent possible, our operations will not be negatively impacted by the euro. On a company-wide basis, those efforts have been coordinated by the corporate Treasurer and have included internal personnel as well as external consultants. The ECS is currently evaluating the impact of the euro on the operations located in Europe. The MCS is in the renovation and implementation stages of addressing euro conversion related system issues for its European operations.           The failure to correct a material euro conversion issue could result in an interruption in, or failure of, certain normal business activities. Such failures could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Due to the general uncertainty inherent in the conversion to the euro, we are unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of euro conversion failures will have a material impact on the company's results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.  Item 7a       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk           Our financial instruments exposed to changes in interest rates are primarily cash on hand and long-term debt obligations. We invest our excess cash with high credit-rated financial institutions. We limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extent practical. Our board has adopted policies relating to these risks and the audit committee of the board continually monitors compliance with these policies.           The majority of our credit facilities have variable interest rates. Accordingly, interest expense may increase if the rates associated with, or the amount of, our borrowings move higher. In addition, we may pursue additional or alternative financing for growth opportunities in one or both segments. We may use interest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates. However, we have not used any of these instruments to date.                                      Page 27 of 64                 The table below presents principal amounts in equivalent U.S. dollars and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our cash investments and debt obligations. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to its short-term nature. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its fair value after taking into consideration current rates offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.

In order to reduce our exposure resulting from currency fluctuations, we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts and/or currency options. These contracts guarantee a predetermined range of exchange rates at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. At December 31, 1998, we had two forward exchange contracts and three currency options outstanding. All were short-term in duration and immaterial to our financial position. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts and                                     Page 28 of 64      currency options, we consider the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies, the type of currency, and the costs associated with the contracts.
