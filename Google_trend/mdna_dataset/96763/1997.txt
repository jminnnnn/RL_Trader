ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview      Technitrol, Inc. ("Technitrol" or the "Company") is a diversified manufacturer of electronic components, metallurgical products and test and measurement equipment.      The Company's businesses are operated in those business segments.  The Electronic Components Segment provides a broad array of magnetics-based components, miniature chip inductors, modules and wireless network products for use primarily in local area network and telecommunication products. Manufacturing occurs in the United States, Ireland, Taiwan, the Philippines and the People's Republic of China.      The Metallurgical Products Segment is a broad based manufacturer of precious metal electrical contacts, bonded or clad metals and contact bearing components.  These products are used in a variety of applications which include residential, commercial and industrial circuit breakers, motor controls, relays, wiring devices, temperature controls, appliances and various electronic products.  This Segment also produces sophisticated electroplating and metal refining services and produces certain components for the automotive industry.  Manufacturing takes place in the United States, Puerto Rico, Germany and Spain.      The Test & Measurement Products Segment produces a variety of force measurement products, complementary measurement equipment and mechanical scales.  Principal uses of these products are the determination of weight, force, tension, compression and torque as well as the density and flow characteristics of plastics and other liquids.  Manufacturing occurs in the United States and Great Britain.  In early 1997, the Company announced its decision to explore the divestiture of the Test & Measurement Products Segment if an acceptable transaction can be arranged.      In 1993, the Company adopted a strategy which focused on expansion of the Company's electronics business by acquiring companies serving markets characterized by significant growth opportunities.  In 1994, the Company acquired the Fil-Mag companies with manufacturing capabilities in Taiwan and the Philippines.  In late 1995, the Company acquired Pulse Engineering, Inc. ("Pulse") with manufacturing capabilities in Ireland and China.  In 1996, these businesses, together with the Components Division of the Company, were combined to form the Electronic Components Segment which provides an array of products for solving problems of customers engaged in designing and manufacturing local area network and telecommunications products.  The Company believes that the Electronic Components Segment is a global market leader in the development and sale of components for local area network products.      In 1996, the Company also acquired a majority equity interest in Netwave Technologies, Inc. ("NTI").  NTI was organized in 1996 to acquire the assets of the wireless local area network business formerly conducted by Xircom, Inc.  The Company made a capital contribution to NTI of cash and the assets which comprised the wireless local area network business formerly conducted by the Electronic Components Segment.  The minority interest in NTI is owned by a group of employees.      In late 1996, in furtherance of its strategy of creating significant critical mass in and further geographical penetration of its metallurgical businesses, the Company acquired the assets of Doduco GmbH which is engaged in the manufacture in Germany and Spain of precious metal contacts, bimetal products and certain contact product modules.  These operations were combined with the Company's Advanced Metallurgy, Inc. ("AMI") companies and Chace Precision Metals, Inc. ("Chace") to form the Metallurgical Products Segment.  The Company believes that the Metallurgical Products Segment now possesses the critical mass necessary to enable this Segment to capitalize on advantages in the global markets for metallurgical contact, bimetal and related products.                                  Page 11 of 43       During the first quarter of 1996, the Company sold the assets of its Products Division (part of the Test & Measurement Products Segment) which manufactured currency counters and dispensers.  In early 1997, the Company announced its intention to sell the remainder of its Test & Measurement Products Segment if an appropriate transaction can be arranged.  Formal decisions, including the method of sale, the timing of the sales and the expected selling price, have not yet been made.  Since this Segment is profitable, the Company may continue to operate it if appropriate value cannot be obtained.      In management's opinion, the investments and strategies described above have positioned the Company for future growth and the creation of additional shareholder value.      This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as other sections of this Report, contain certain "forward looking statements" (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) with respect to the Company's results of operations, financial condition and other operational matters. Words or phrases denoting the anticipated results of future events - such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "will likely," "are expected to," "will continue," "project," and similar expressions that denote uncertainty - are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially:  (1)  as a result of risks and uncertainties identified in connection with those forward-looking statements, including those factors identified in the section captioned "Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and those factors set forth elsewhere in this Report under the caption "Cautionary Statement For Purposes of the `Safe Harbor' Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995";  (2)  as a result of factors over which the Company has no control, including the strength of domestic and foreign economies, sales growth, competition and certain cost increases; or (3)  if the factors on which the Company's expectations are based do not prove to be correct.  The data herein is published solely for the information of the Company's shareholders.  No statement in this Report is made for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of any security issued by the Company.  Liquidity and Capital Resources      At December 31, 1996, the Company's cash balance was approximately $43.5 million.  This represents an increase of $29.6 million from the end of 1995.  The cash on-hand at the end of 1996 included approximately $6.4 million that was used to repay debt in January 1997 and, separately, approximately $7.7 million that was also used early in 1997 for the purchase of real estate in Germany pertinent to Doduco.  Although the acquisition of Doduco was completed on October 31, 1996 as more fully explained below, a portion of the real estate acquired was not transferred until early in 1997 as a result of legal proceedings and documentation activities that are customary in Germany.  Total working capital was $74.8 million at the end of the year and, after adjustments for the two items related to cash and noted above, was $68.4 million.      The positive cash flow from operations in 1996 enabled the Company to increase cash in addition to reducing approximately $9.0 million of long- term debt.  Plans implemented by the Metallurgical Product Segment's management to reduce overhead and lower break even points had a positive impact on cash flow during the year, as did the improved operating margins within the Electronic Components Segment.  Accounts receivable increased by $10.8 million during the year as a result of the record sales level.  There were no receivables acquired in connection with the acquisition of Doduco, except for those receivables of the Doduco subsidiary in Spain.  The funding of Doduco's accounts receivable, along with other elements of Doduco's working capital requirements, occurred after the October 31, 1996 acquisition date.  Excluding inventory acquired in connection with the NTI and Doduco acquisitions, inventories decreased by $7.0 million from the end of 1995.  The total inventory level is related to a backlog of approximately $84.8 million at December 31, 1996, including approximately $32.8 for Doduco.  The backlog at December 31, 1995 was $55.9 million. Inventories decreased significantly in the Metallurgical Products Segment as a result of inventory management procedures implemented in connection with efforts to improve the Segment's operating performance and cash flow. In addition, certain precious metal inventories which were previously owned by Doduco are now held on consignment under a leasing arrangement. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased commensurate with the higher sales volume.                                  Page 12 of 43       Cash used by investing activities was $15.3 million during the year. The acquisition of Doduco was completed on October 31, 1996 and $10.5 million of cash related to the acquisition was paid during 1996.  The payment for real estate in Pforzheim, Germany (approximately $7.7 million) and certain transaction expenses related to the acquisition were paid subsequent to December 31, 1996.  The total purchase price for Doduco was approximately $20.5 million and, as noted above, significant elements of working capital (including accounts receivable) were not acquired. Additional working capital will be funded in 1997.  The purchase price for the NTI transaction, including related expenses, was approximately $1.2 million (including amounts paid by minority shareholders).  In addition to the Doduco and Netwave acquisitions, capital expenditures totaled $7.8 million during the year.  Such expenditures were generally made for the purposes of expanding production capacity and improving efficiency. Projected 1997 capital expenditures are expected to be financed by internally generated funds.      The cash received from the sale of the Company's Products Division approximated $3.7 million.  The funds received were used to repay debt and for transaction expenses.      Debt repayments totaled $9.0 million during the year, and total new borrowings were $30.8 million.  The Company's domestic credit facility of $45.0 million includes a revolving credit portion and a term loan.  The $7.0 million that was outstanding under the revolver at December 31, 1995 was repaid in its entirety and $2.0 million was repaid under the term loan during the year.  In connection with the acquisition of Doduco, the Company obtained a $40.0 million multi-currency credit facility.  Initially, the funds for the purchase of the assets of Doduco were obtained under a temporary acquisition facility.  Those borrowings were refinanced under the $40.0 million multi-currency credit facility.  As of December 31, 1996, all borrowings under the multi-currency facility were denominated in Deutsche marks.  The borrowings are expected to be repaid from the eventual cash flows of Doduco and, since the functional currency of the primary Doduco operation is Deutsche marks, the Company does not believe that it has significant foreign currency exposure related to this facility.      The Company received $2.1 million from the exercise of stock options during 1996.  The options exercised were among those assumed in connection with the acquisition of Pulse in 1995.  No new options have been granted. Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" did not affect the Company's results of operations or related disclosures as no new options have been granted.      During the third quarter of 1996, the Company paid, as a part of its previously announced stock repurchase program, $1.0 million for the purchase of 36,600 shares of common stock.  The stock repurchase plan was formally rescinded in November 1996.  Dividends of $3.2 million were paid during 1996 and it is expected that quarterly dividend payments will continue to be made during 1997.      The Company believes that cash from operations and, if necessary, additional borrowings under its credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy the Company's requirements for the foreseeable future.  Significant cash may be received in connection with the possible divestiture of the Test & Measurement Products Segment.  If the divestiture plan is successful, the Company ultimately expects to invest the funds received into the remaining business Segments.  In addition, internally generated funds and additional  borrowings may be used for acquisitions of suitable businesses or assets upon terms acceptable to the Board of Directors.      Prior to 1994, substantially all of the Company's operations were in the U.S.  Since 1994, an increasing percentage of the Company's revenues are earned outside of the U.S.  The Company's foreign sales are conducted primarily through its foreign subsidiaries, principally in the Far East and Europe.  In the Far East, the Company's sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.  In Europe, sales are denominated principally in local currencies. In 1996, approximately 43% of the Company's international sales (including the sales of Doduco) were made in local currencies and the remainder in U.S. dollars.  The Company anticipates that in 1997 (primarily as a result of the acquisition of Doduco) and beyond, the percentage of the Company's sales that are made in local currencies will increase.  This increase in sales denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars will increase the Company's potential exposure to currency fluctuations, which can adversely affect results.  The Company has not experienced any material exchange losses through 1996.                                 Page 13 of 43       In order to reduce the Company's exposure resulting from currency fluctuations, the Company may purchase currency exchange forward contracts on a regular basis.  These contracts guarantee a predetermined exchange rate at the time the contract is purchased.  This allows the Company to shift the risk, whether positive or negative, of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party.  At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company did not have any outstanding currency exchange forward contracts.  When used, the contracts are primarily in European currencies. The Company will consider increasing the use of currency exchange forward contracts during fiscal year 1997 and beyond depending on the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies and the type of currency.  In addition, the Company will evaluate the use of currency options in order to reduce the impact that exchange rate fluctuations have on the Company's gross margins for sales made by the Company's foreign operations.  The combination of currency exchange forward contracts and currency options should result in reducing the Company's risks associated with significant exchange rate fluctuations.      Approximately 18% of the Company's identifiable assets are located in the Far East and significant sales and operating profits are generated in that region.  (See the geographic segment data included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this report on Form 10-K.)  The Company's operations in the region include manufacturing plants in the Peoples Republic of China and in the Philippines.  If unfavorable political, economic or other events occur in that region, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and capital resources.  Management continually monitors events in the region and takes steps to reduce the risk of uncertainty when possible.      A material portion of the Company's liquid assets are offshore and, in general, are unlikely to be repatriated to the U.S.  As has been the case in recent years, management expects that a significant portion of the Company's opportunities for growth in the coming years will be outside of the U.S.  Accordingly, the Company's policy with regard to foreign earnings is generally to invest them abroad.  If such earnings were repatriated, significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the U.S.  In the event that a substantial amount of foreign earnings were repatriated, the related tax liabilities could have a material unfavorable impact on the Company's liquidity and cash flow.  Results of Operations  1996 and 1995      Revenues      Consolidated sales for the Company in 1996 were $274.1 million, an increase of 55.4% over 1995.  The Electronic Components Segment, which includes Pulse (acquired in September 1995), experienced significant demand from its customers in the computer, local area network (LAN) and telecommunication markets during the first half and the fourth quarter of 1996.  However, as expected, the sales level in this Segment declined somewhat in the third quarter reflecting the lower order rate in the second and part of the third quarter.  The decline in orders (occurring primarily in the United States and to a lesser extent in Asia) was the result of widely observed inventory level adjustments and project deferrals occurring within the industry.  Order entry for this Segment improved significantly during the fourth quarter of the year.      Sales of the Metallurgical Products Segment were significantly higher than the sales of the Segment in 1995.  The higher level of sales in 1996 reflected Doduco's sales of approximately $22.7 million for the two-month period subsequent to the acquisition.  Volume increases at AMI more than offset a decrease in sales at Chace relative to 1995.  Higher market prices for metals, which are factored in customer prices for certain products of the Segment, also contributed to the sales increase.  In 1996, more favorable domestic economic conditions affecting the manufacturers of circuit protection, power control and power distribution equipment continued to have a significant impact on the sales volume of the Segment.      Total sales for the Test & Measurement Products Segment in 1996 were lower than the prior year as a result of the sale of the Products Division during the first quarter of 1996.  The sales of that Division were approximately $4.9 million for the full year of 1995.  Without the effect of the Products Division sales, the Test & Measurement Products Segment experienced a sales increase in 1996.  This increase included higher sales of systems which provide for automatic testing within manufacturing processes.                                 Page 14 of 43       Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses      During 1996, the Company's consolidated gross margin was 33.5%, an increase from 31.5% in 1995.  The higher gross margin was primarily the result of improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher shipments within the Electronic Components Segment.  The relocation of a major portion of that Segment's manufacturing capacity from Taiwan to the Philippines contributed positively to the improved margins during 1996.  Total costs of approximately $2.1 million associated with that relocation were included in general and administrative expenses during 1996.  The majority of these costs were incurred during the first half of 1996 and the realization of the cost savings began during the last half of the year.  Manufacturing efficiencies in Pulse's operations in China, which had begun to be realized during the second half of 1995, continued during 1996.      The significant improvement in the Metallurgical Products Segment also contributed to the improved gross margin and operating performance in 1996 as this Segment successfully addressed the increased price competition and raw material cost increases which negatively impacted the last half of 1995.  As a result, overhead spending was reduced and break-even points lowered.  These actions had a favorable impact on the profitability of the Segment, particularly with the higher volume in 1996.      Earnings of the Test & Measurement Products Segment, including the gain realized on the sale of the Products Division, increased significantly from the comparable prior year period.  Without that gain, the results of the Segment in 1996 were lower than in the prior year as the prior year included a full year of the operating profit of the Products Division.  The results of Lloyd Instruments during 1996 included certain one time reorganization expenses incurred in Germany, primarily during the first quarter of 1996.  These expenses offset the favorable impact of more service and repair work in 1996, which typically has a higher gross margin than sales of products.      Total selling, general and administrative expenses for 1996 were $61.7 million compared to $40.2 million for 1995.  This represents an increase of 53.5%.  The increase included the effect of the acquisition of Pulse, as well as approximately $2.1 million of restructuring charges associated with the relocation of a portion of the manufacturing capacity of the Company's Electronic Components Segment from Taiwan to the Philippines. Administrative costs also reflected the higher spending required to support the higher level of sales and increased complexity of the Company.      Research, development & engineering expenses ("RD&E") were $10.5 million during 1996 and are included in general and administrative expenses.  RD&E was $6.6 million, $2.4 million, and $1.5 million for the Electronic Components Segment, the Metallurgical Products Segment and the Test & Measurement Products Segment, respectively.  These amounts include expenditures for new product development and for product and process improvement.  The Company stresses the importance of RD&E spending and believes that it is critical to the future growth and business prospects of each Segment.      Interest      Interest expense of approximately $1.2 million slightly exceeded interest income of approximately $1.0 million during the year.  In 1995, interest expense was $1.4 million and interest income was $0.4 million. Prior to the acquisition of Doduco during the fourth quarter of 1996, the level of debt outstanding had been reduced significantly from the amount outstanding at the end of 1995.  The cash flow that was generated also provided the Company with higher levels of cash reserves which are invested in short-term deposit instruments.  The earnings on these investments provides interest income and reduces the amount of net interest expense incurred by the Company.  In connection with the acquisition of Doduco and the initial working capital requirements of the acquired business, additional borrowings occurred late in 1996.  In general, the interest rates that the Company has received on its credit facilities are quite favorable.  The rate on the term debt balance of $8.0 million at December 31, 1996 is fixed at 6.65%.  The Company's other credit facilities have variable interest rates.                                  Page 15 of 43       Income Taxes      The effective income tax rate for 1996 was 34.3%, a decrease from the effective rate of 35.8% during 1995.  The decrease was caused by proportionately more taxable income earned by the Company's offshore operating units, which generally incur lower tax rates than those experienced by the Company's domestic operations.  Although a significant portion of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located offshore, the consolidated effective income tax rate is affected by many non-recurring items.  Certain reorganization expenses incurred by Lloyd Instruments during the year are not presently deductible for income tax purposes. Additionally, the sale of the Product Division during the first quarter of 1996 provided a significant gain for U.S. tax purposes.  The Doduco operations will likely produce profits in higher tax rate jurisdictions and the Company believes that its 1997 effective tax rate will exceed that experienced in 1996.      In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, ("FAS121"). FAS121 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts.  FAS121 has not had a material impact on the Company's financial statements.  1995 and 1994      Revenues      Consolidated sales for the Company were $176.4 million in 1995, an increase of 20.5% from 1994.  The increase was largely due to the sales of Pulse, acquired at the end of September 1995.  The Pulse sales included in the consolidated results of the Company were approximately $25.4 million. The sales increases of the Electronic Components Segment (which includes Pulse) and the Test & Measurement Products Segment exceeded a sales decrease experienced by the Metallurgical Products Segment.  The Company's backlog at December 31, 1995 was $55.9 million, including $28.2 million for Pulse.      The sales of the Electronic Components Segment increased from $41.2 million in 1994 to $68.4 million in 1995.  The Fil-Mag Group and Pulse, along with the Components Division of the Company, were combined into one world-wide operation serving the needs of the local area network (LAN) and telecommunications marketplaces.  In addition to the Pulse sales noted above, sales of the Fil-Mag Group increased during the year.  The lower sales level of the Components Division, which was caused by a decline in domestic demand for that Division's products, was more than offset by increased demand for products manufactured by Fil-Mag and Pulse.  The strong demand of these markets for products produced by Pulse and the Fil- Mag Group continued into the beginning of 1996, as evidenced by solid backlog and order levels at the end of 1995.  Operating profits for the Segment in 1995 were $10.7 million compared to $5.0 million in 1994.  The sales and operating profits of the Segment included three months of Pulse activity.       The Metallurgical Products Segment experienced a number of challenges during 1995 and the sales and operating profits of this Segment were lower than the 1994 levels.  Sales in 1995 were $75.3 million, down slightly from $76.5 million in 1994.  A sales decrease at AMI exceeded a sales increase at Chace.  The sales of AMI and, to a lesser extent, Chace are affected by general trends in the domestic economy, particularly those in housing, automotive, appliances and capital equipment markets.  During the second half of 1995, there was a softening in demand for the products of this Segment.  In addition, the Segment's operating profits were negatively impacted by increased price competition and rapidly escalating raw material costs, particularly in the nonprecious metals markets.  Management focused significant attention on attaining increased manufacturing efficiencies and implemented a partial pass-through of the raw material price changes by way of both a price increase and a metals factor.  Operating profits of the Segment were $1.8 million in 1995, down from $4.8 million in 1994.                                  Page 16 of 43       In the Test & Measurement Products Segment, sales increases at Chatillon and Lloyd Instruments exceeded a sales decrease at the Products Division.  That sales decrease was primarily caused by weak domestic demand for the currency counters and dispensers manufactured by the Products Division. Relative to the 1995 results, Lloyd in particular contributed to the higher sales and operating profits of the Segment.  The 1995 Lloyd sales included a full year of the sales of Erichsen, a German subsidiary acquired late in 1994.  Chatillon's sales benefited from recent product development efforts.  Sales for the Segment increased from $28.7 million in 1994 to $32.8 million in 1995 while operating profits increased from $2.7 million to $2.9 million.      Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses      In 1995, the Company's gross margin increased from 29.6% of sales in 1994 to 31.5% in 1995.  This margin increase was driven primarily by the strong product demand and increased manufacturing efficiencies within the Electronic Components Segment.  These gains offset the lower gross profits of the Metallurgical Products Segment which experienced significant decreases in gross profits versus the prior year, with the majority of the gross profit decline occurring at AMI.  The softer demand, increased price competition and rising metal costs noted above caused this decline.      The Company's selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $40.2 million in 1995 from $30.8 million in 1994.  This represented 22.8% of sales in 1995 and 21.0% of sales in 1994.  The increase included the addition of Pulse for the fourth quarter.      Interest      Interest expense increased from $1.1 million in 1994 to $1.4 million in 1995 reflecting the incremental borrowing related to the Pulse acquisition.      Income Taxes      The Company's effective income tax rate declined to 35.8% in 1995 from 39.0% in 1994.  During 1995, proportionately higher taxable income was earned by the Company's foreign operations, which generally have lower tax rates than the domestic operations.
