ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview       Technitrol, Inc. ("Technitrol" or the "Company") is a global manufacturer of electronic and metallurgical components.  The Company's businesses are broadly operated in two business Segments.       Electronic Components Segment ("ECS")       The Electronic Components Segment provides a broad array of magnetics- based components, miniature chip inductors and modules for use primarily in local area network, telecommunication and power-conversion products. Manufacturing occurs in the United States, Ireland, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines and the People's Republic of China.       In 1993, the Company adopted a strategy of expanding its electronic components business by acquiring companies serving markets that the Company believes offer significant growth opportunities.  In 1994, the Company acquired the Fil-Mag companies with manufacturing capabilities in Taiwan and the Philippines.  In late 1995, the Company acquired Pulse Engineering, Inc. ("Pulse") with manufacturing capabilities in Ireland and China.  In 1996, these businesses, together with the Components Division of the Company, were combined under the Pulse name within the ECS.  In late 1997, the Company acquired the magnetic components business of Northern Telecom Ltd. ("Nortel"). That business, which became part of Pulse, includes manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and Thailand and a design engineering group in Canada.  The Company believes that these acquisitions have positioned the ECS as a global market leader in the development and sale of components for local area network, telecommunication and power-conversion products.       In 1996, the Company acquired a majority equity interest in Netwave Technologies, Inc. ("Netwave") which was organized in 1996 to acquire the assets of the wireless local area network products business formerly conducted by Xircom, Inc.  The Company made a capital contribution to Netwave of cash and assets.  On December 31, 1997, the Company sold a significant portion of its ownership interest back to Netwave, while retaining a 19% interest.  The Company concluded that Netwave, while continuing to represent an attractive long-term opportunity, required more time and capital than that which was appropriate for the Company to provide in light of its focus on building the value of its core businesses.       Metallurgical Components Segment ("MCS")       The Metallurgical Components Segment is a broad-based manufacturer of precious metal electrical contacts, bonded or clad metals and contact assemblies. These electrical components are used in a variety of applications which include residential, commercial and industrial circuit breakers, motor controls, relays, wiring devices, temperature controls, appliances, automotive and various electrical products.  This Segment also engages in sophisticated electroplating and metal refining services.  Manufacturing takes place in the United States, Puerto Rico, Germany and Spain.       In late 1996, in furtherance of its strategy of creating critical mass in and further geographical penetration of its metallurgical businesses, the Company acquired the assets of Doduco GmbH ("Doduco"), which is engaged in the manufacture in Germany and Spain of precious metal contacts, bimetal products and certain contact assemblies.  These operations were combined with the Company's metallurgical component operations within the MCS and now operate globally under the name AMI Doduco.  The Company believes that the MCS now possesses the critical mass necessary to enable this Segment to capitalize on advantages in the global markets for metallurgical contacts, bimetals and related products.                                   Page 12 of 48       In 1997, the MCS began a product rationalization effort in which it identified products which did not fit into its core businesses.  These product lines will be sold or discontinued.  In addition, in 1997, the MCS formed global teams to examine and pursue the synergies made available to the MCS by virtue of its global position (i.e., technology, information systems, manufacturing, purchasing and selling).  Management expects these efforts to continue through 1998.       Discontinued Operations       During the first quarter of 1996, the Company sold the assets of its Products Division (part of the Test & Measurement Products Segment) which manufactured currency counters and dispensers.  In June 1997, the Company completed the sale of the remainder of its Test & Measurement Products Segment, which previously manufactured and sold material testing systems, force measurement products and weighing devices.  The Company concluded that these businesses did not fit within its core competencies nor did they offer opportunities to create significant shareholder value.  The Test & Measurement Products Segment is reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.       In management's opinion, the investments, divestiture and strategies described above have positioned the Company for future growth and the creation of additional shareholder value.       This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as other sections of this Report, contain certain "forward-looking statements" (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) with respect to the Company's results of operations, financial condition and other operational matters. Words or phrases denoting the anticipated results of future events -- such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "will likely," "are expected to," "will continue," "project," and similar expressions that denote uncertainty -- are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially:  (1)  as a result of risks and uncertainties identified in connection with those forward-looking statements, including those factors identified in the section captioned "Commitments and Contingencies" in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and those factors set forth elsewhere in this Report under the caption "Business - Cautionary Statement For Purposes of the 'Safe Harbor' Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995"; (2)  as a result of factors over which the Company has little or no control, including the strength of domestic and foreign economies, market growth, competition and certain cost increases; or (3)  if the factors on which the Company's expectations are based do not prove to be correct.  The data herein are published solely for the information of the Company's shareholders.  No statement in this Report is made for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of any security issued by the Company.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       In June 1997, the Company completed the sale of its Test & Measurement Products Segment for approximately $34.0 million in cash. Taxes related to the gain on the sale of the Segment were primarily U.S. income taxes and the majority of those taxes were paid during the third quarter of 1997.  The net proceeds of the sale were invested in short-term deposit instruments when received, and approximately $22.5 million of these proceeds were then used in early December 1997 to purchase the magnetic components business of Nortel. (See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)       Total working capital at December 31, 1997, was $82.8 million, an increase of $8.0 million from the working capital of $74.8 million at December 31, 1996. Worldwide, cash on-hand at December 31, 1997, was $48.8 million.                                   Page 13 of 48   Cash Flows from Operating Activities       Cash flow from operations was $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  This includes the effect of Netwave's operating losses.  As noted below in "Results of Operations," the Company reduced its ownership interest in Netwave from 80% to 19% on December 31, 1997.  The operations of Netwave will not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated cash flows in 1998.  Accounts receivable increased by $15.4 million during 1997 as a result of the record sales level of the Company as a whole and increased accounts receivable at the newly acquired European operations of AMI Doduco.  The Company did not acquire accounts receivable in Germany as part of the Doduco purchase, and the increase in accounts receivable, along with other elements of Doduco's working capital requirements, occurred into the first part of 1997.  (See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Inventories increased by $12.3 million during the year and reflect strong customer demand, as well as the customer-driven reduction in lead times and continued push to just-in-time delivery.  Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased significantly in 1997 as a result of the Company's higher sales and profits, increased inventory level, higher income taxes payable and increased working capital requirements at AMI Doduco's European operations. These changes in assets and liabilities are net of the effect of discontinued operations and do not reflect the acquisition of the magnetic components business of Nortel.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities       Cash used by investing activities was $6.9 million during 1997.  The proceeds of the sale of the Test & Measurement Products Segment were received in early June and, for the total year, were offset by payments related to the Doduco acquisition, the acquisition of the magnetic components business of Nortel and by the Company's investment in capital equipment and facilities. Approximately $8.1 million was used for the purchase of Doduco real estate and for the payment of acquisition expenses previously accrued.  Although the acquisition of Doduco was completed on October 31, 1996, a portion of the real estate acquired was not transferred until early in 1997 as a result of legal proceedings and documentation that are customary in Germany.       Cash payments for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled approximately $13.4 million, or about 3% of revenues, ($18.1 million including the Nortel acquisition) during 1997.  Further capital expenditures are expected during 1998 for purposes of expanding production capacity and improving the operating efficiency of the Company's businesses.  The expansion of production capacity and/or the acquisition of other businesses or product lines may result in the Company conducting business in countries where it does not currently have operating facilities. In addition to operating companies in Europe, the Company's foreign operations are conducted in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.  The Company is currently expanding its manufacturing facilities in China and Thailand.  With the exception of approximately $3.2 million of retained earnings in China which have been appropriated and restricted in accordance with Chinese regulations, substantially all unremitted earnings held abroad are free from legal or contractual restrictions in the country of incorporation. The Company has not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which it operates and none are foreseen.  However, foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which certain governments require for international cash transfers may potentially delay cash remittances from time to time. The earnings of these entities represent a material portion of the Company's liquid assets and are likely to be reinvested outside of the United States.  As has been the case in recent years, management expects that a significant portion of the Company's opportunities for growth in the coming years will be outside of the United States.  Accordingly, the Company's policy with regard to foreign earnings is generally to invest them abroad.  If such earnings were repatriated, significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the United States.  In the event that foreign earnings were repatriated, the related tax liabilities could have a material unfavorable impact on the Company's liquidity and cash flow.       The Company believes that cash generated by operations and, if necessary, additional borrowings under its credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy the Company's cash requirements for the foreseeable future.                                   Page 14 of 48   Cash Flows from Financing Activities       Long-term debt repayments in 1997 totaled $19.1 million, comprising a significant portion of the total cash used in financing activities.  Those repayments relate to the Company's domestic term debt, domestic revolving credit facility, local debt in Spain (assumed in connection with the acquisition of Doduco) and its multi-currency facility.  Long-term borrowings of $15.5 million were incurred in 1997 under the Company's multi-currency facility.  The borrowings under that facility at December 31, 1997, were exclusively denominated in Deutsche marks.  The borrowings are expected to continue to be repaid from the cash flows of AMI Doduco's German operations and, since the functional currency of that operation is Deutsche marks, the Company does not believe that it has significant foreign currency exposure related to this facility.  The net repayments of short-term debt (as shown on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows at December 31, 1997) include additional interim borrowings and the December 31, 1997, repayment under the separate line of credit for Netwave, as well as payments made on local debt in Spain.  Under all credit facilities in place at December 31, 1997, the Company had approximately $53.1 million available for additional borrowing.  Dividends of $3.3 million were paid during 1997.  Quarterly dividends are expected to continue to be paid during the foreseeable future.  During the first quarter of 1998, the Company increased its quarterly dividend from $.0525 to $.06 per share.       The Company received $.3 million from the exercise of stock options during 1997.  The options exercised were among those assumed in connection with the acquisition of Pulse and no new options have been granted by the Company.  Foreign Currency Effects       During 1997, the Company did not experience any significant foreign currency gains or losses.  However, as a result of denominating a significant amount of sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (and especially the European sales of AMI Doduco which are primarily denominated in Deutsche marks), the reported financial results of the Company are subject to the effect of changing exchange rates, particularly the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Deutsche mark.  At December 31, 1997, the Deutsche mark was approximately 14% weaker relative to the dollar than at December 31, 1996. This currency movement had the effect of lowering the U.S. dollar-reported amount of sales and profits of AMI Doduco.       During 1997, a number of currencies in the countries where the Company manufactures and/or sells products (in addition to the Deutsche mark) depreciated significantly relative to the U.S. dollar.  Although the Company has operations in certain countries which have experienced significant devaluations, such as Ireland, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand, the depreciation of those currencies has not had a significant negative impact on the results of operations of the Company.  For the most part, the Company's sales originating in those countries, as well as the majority of raw material purchases, are denominated in U.S. dollars, while expenses in those countries, particularly labor and overhead, are denominated and paid in local currencies. As a result, the devaluation of local currencies favorably affects the Company's profitability by reducing the manufacturing costs paid in those currencies.  Consolidated 1997 sales into Asia were only approximately 8% of the Company's total sales.  Moreover, many of the components that are sold into Asia are incorporated in devices exported to North America and Europe. In view of these factors, the Company remains optimistic about its prospects in the Asia Pacific region and is committed to its presence there over the long term. The widespread manufacturing presence of the Company in Asia (which is much broader than that of any of the major competitors of the ECS) has been a key factor in the success of the Company and management believes that it will continue to be so in the future.  Nevertheless, management of the Company is aware of the potential seriousness (and inherent unpredictability) of the current economic situation in Asia and is paying careful attention to related developments.                                   Page 15 of 48        In order to reduce the Company's exposure resulting from currency fluctuations, the Company may purchase currency exchange forward contracts. These contracts guarantee a predetermined exchange rate at the time the contract is purchased.  This allows the Company to shift the risk, whether positive or negative, of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party.  The only outstanding forward contract at December 31, 1997, related to an equipment purchase for approximately 116,000 British pounds sterling.  Its impact on the Company's financial statements was immaterial. The Company will consider increasing the use of currency exchange forward contracts, depending on the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies and the type of currency, and depending on the fees and other costs associated with such contracts.  In addition, the company evaluates the use of currency options in order to reduce the impact that exchange rate fluctuations have on the Company's gross margins for sales made by the Company's foreign operations. The combination of currency exchange forward contracts and currency options should result in reducing the Company's risks associated with significant exchange rate fluctuations.       New Accounting Pronouncements       In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 128, "Earnings Per Share."  This statement specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share. Earnings per share for the Company in prior years have been restated to conform with this Statement.       In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" and SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."  The Company elected to implement these new accounting standards for the year ended December 31, 1997. These standards have no impact on the results of operations, financial condition or long-term liquidity. SFAS No. 130 requires that all items required to be recognized as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements.  Items that are not currently included in the Company's statement of earnings, but which are defined as components of comprehensive income, include currency translation gains or losses and certain other items which have historically been charged or credited directly to shareholders' equity.  SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for reporting information about operating Segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information about operating Segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders.  It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.  The Company's related disclosures are included in the sections entitled "Business Segment Information" and "Geographic Information" in this report.  Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to the presentation required by SFAS No. 130 and SFAS No. 131.  Results of Operations       Sale of the Test & Measurement Products Segment       The results of the Test & Measurement Products Segment are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.  The Products Division, which was sold during the first quarter of 1996, was included in the Test & Measurement Products Segment.  The divestiture of the Products Division occurred prior to the Company's decision to divest the entire Segment, and financial information for the Division had not been separately reported in previous financial statements.   Accordingly, the gain on the sale of that Division was included in income from continuing operations.  The 1997 sales of the Test & Measurement Products Segment were approximately $11.8 million prior to the divestiture on June 4, 1997.                                   Page 16 of 48       Revenues       Sales attributable to continuing operations were $397.1 million, $243.3 million and $143.7 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  In 1996, sales increased by 69.3% over 1995, and 1997 sales further increased by 63.2% over 1996.  The increased sales in 1997 are primarily attributable to the acquisition of AMI Doduco's European manufacturing operations.  In addition, the ECS made a significant contribution to the record sales during 1997.  The sales increase in 1996 over 1995 was driven by the inclusion of a full year of operations of Pulse (which was acquired in September 1995) and the significant demand from Pulse's customers in the local area network ("LAN"), telecommunication and computer markets.  As noted above, this demand continued into most of 1997 and contributed to the further sales growth during the year.       The sales of the ECS during the fourth quarter of 1996 and the full year of 1997 include the sales of Netwave which were not significant to the total sales of the ECS or the Company as a whole.  During 1998 and beyond, the consolidated sales of the Company will not include the sales of Netwave.       In the third quarter of 1997, ECS revenues reached a record level driven by the higher level of incoming orders during most of the first half of the year.  In this Segment, incoming orders began to decline in the third quarter of 1997, particularly in the North American LAN market.  During the third quarter of 1996, the sales level in this Segment declined somewhat, reflecting the lower order rate in the second and part of the third quarter of that year. That decline in orders (occurring primarily in the United States and to a lesser extent in Asia at that time) was the result of widely observed inventory level adjustments and project deferrals occurring within the industry.  While there has been significant sustained growth within the ECS over a long period of time, sudden changes in customer demand often occur during a given year.  Those changes relate to inventory adjustments, technology changes (actual and expected), the desire of end users to update local area networks, new product introductions and other factors.  The backlog of the Segment at December 31, 1997, was approximately 13% lower than the level at the end of the second quarter, but only about 1% lower than at the end of 1996.  During 1997, the significance of backlog levels as an indicator of future business activity was reduced as a result of changing customer order patterns and significantly shorter lead times.  The backlog at December 31, 1997, includes orders for the magnetic components business acquired from Nortel on November 30, 1997.       Total sales of the MCS, which includes AMI Doduco's European operations, were $217.3 million in 1997 compared with $100.5 million in 1996 and $75.3 million in 1995.  As noted above, the European sales reported by AMI Doduco (which account for the large increase in sales of the Segment) are subject to the fluctuating exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and European currencies, particularly the Deutsche mark.  European sales for 1997 exceeded management's earlier expectations and reflected the positive impact of efforts to improve the overall performance of recently acquired European operations, notwithstanding the significant strengthening of the dollar against the Deutsche mark since the beginning of 1997.  The integration of the worldwide operations of the MCS is continuing.  The product rationalization plan may result in revenue decreases for the Segment in the near term of up to $10 million (at current exchange rates and assuming an immediate impact) which may be largely offset by sales growth of the continuing products of the Segment.       Cost of Sales       During 1997, the Company's gross margin for continuing operations was 32.2%, a slight increase from 31.7% in 1996.  The gross margin in 1996 represented an increase from the gross margin of 27.5% in 1995.  The gross margin of the ECS has improved notably in 1997 relative to 1996 and 1995, and the margin improvement in that Segment has more than offset the impact of the acquisition of AMI Doduco's European operations and the growth of the MCS which generally has a lower gross margin than the ECS.  In general, long-term margin improvement is expected in the MCS as the European operations are integrated with the other operations of the Segment and the product rationalization plan is completed.  Some of this improvement was evidenced in the results of the MCS during the fourth quarter of 1997, when the MCS had more favorable operating margins than in any of the first three quarters of the year.  At the same time, however, the industries served by the Segment are characterized by aggressive competition and constant pressure on sales prices resulting from on-going customer cost reduction activities.                                   Page 17 of 48       The favorable cost impact of the relocation of a major portion of the ECS's manufacturing capacity from Taiwan to the Philippines also contributed to higher margins in 1997.  That relocation occurred during 1996 and also contributed to the improved margins of 1996 (especially in the second half of the year) relative to 1995. In both 1997 and 1996, the ECS benefited from higher volumes and improved manufacturing efficiencies at its production facilities, particularly in China.  While 1997 included one month of activity of the operations acquired from Nortel, the effect of that activity was immaterial to the Company's results of operations.  During 1998 and beyond, the ECS may experience some reduction in gross margin percentages, as the Segment expands into more diversified telecommunication and power-conversion product lines and pricing competition for the Segment's existing products becomes more intense within the industry.  The ECS continues to devote considerable efforts to cost reduction activities through selected automation, worldwide materials sourcing, product design and related activities.       Operating Expenses       Total selling, general and administrative expenses for 1997, 1996 and 1995 were $82.3 million, $49.5 million and $26.9 million, respectively.  The 1997 spending represents an increase of 66.0% over 1996 which, in turn, was 84.2% higher than in 1995.  As a percentage of sales, these costs were 20.7% of sales in 1997, 20.4% in 1996 and 18.7% in 1995.  In total dollars, the increases noted above are primarily attributable to the incremental volumes gained via the significant acquisitions by the Company.  Since Pulse was acquired on September 30, 1995, only one quarter of associated spending was included in the Company's 1995 results.  Similarly, Doduco was acquired at the end of October in 1996, and a full year of related spending for that operation is included in the 1997 results.  The costs associated with restructuring certain Far East operations of the ECS were included in the 1996 results. That Segment's 1996 operating profits were negatively impacted by approximately $2.1 million of costs related to the shift of production capacity from Taiwan to the Philippines.  During 1997, administrative costs also reflect the higher spending required to support the higher level of sales and increased global activities of the Company.  These costs include substantial tax and related consulting costs (principally related to the Asia Pacific region), increased levels of administrative support at both the corporate and Segment level, as well as significant travel expenses related to business development opportunities and the investigation of capacity expansion options in various countries.       During 1997, operating expenses attributable to Netwave increased at a rate substantially higher than revenue growth of that business and the losses incurred by that product line are included in the results of the ECS. Although management of the Company believes that the market opportunity with respect to wireless LAN continues to appear attractive, the time frame, effort and investment required to achieve acceptable returns exceeded original expectations and the Company decided to sell a majority of its interest in Netwave prior to the end of 1997.  The sale did not have any material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.  The Company retains a 19% ownership interest in Netwave.  The carrying value of the remaining investment in Netwave in the Company's financial statements is based on cost, but is subject to value impairment analysis by the Company on an ongoing basis.  Its carrying value at December 31, 1997, was immaterial.       In 1997, research, development & engineering expenses ("RD&E"), which are included in general and administrative expenses, were $10.6 million for the ECS and $5.8 million for the MCS.  For the ECS, the comparable amounts were $6.6 million in 1996 and $2.6 million in 1995.  For the MCS, RD&E spending was $2.4 million in 1996 and $1.8 million in 1995.  These amounts include expenditures for new product development and for product and process improvements.  RD&E expenses have increased in 1997 relative to 1996, and further increases may occur, particularly in the ECS, as the importance of new product development is recognized throughout the Company.                                   Page 18 of 48       Interest       Interest expense amounts were approximately $2.4 million, $1.2 million, and $1.4 million, in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Additional borrowings were made late in 1996 in connection with the acquisition of Doduco.  These additional borrowings caused the interest charge to increase for the Company during 1997.  Borrowings were also made in connection with the acquisition of Pulse in 1995.  However, as a result of the positive cash flow from operations and the cash received from the sale of the Test & Measurement Products Segment on June 4, 1997, the Company has also had a much higher than historical level of funds invested and the earnings on those short-term deposit instruments have generated correspondingly higher amounts of interest income.  Interest income decreased very late in 1997 after cash was consumed to complete the acquisition of the magnetic components business of Nortel.  Interest income amounts were $2.5 million, $.9 million and $.3 million during 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  The majority of the Company's credit facilities have variable interest rates.  Accordingly, interest expense may increase if the rates associated with (or the amounts drawn down on) the Company's credit facilities move higher during subsequent quarters.  The Company may use interest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates; however, the Company has not used any such instruments thus far.  Income taxes       The effective income tax rate for continuing operations during 1997 was 37.8%, compared to effective rates of 33.3% in 1996 and 35.6% in 1995.  The increase in the Company's effective tax rate for 1997 reflects the additional taxable income of AMI Doduco's operations in relatively high-rate jurisdictions, particularly Germany.  The increase during 1997 has been somewhat less pronounced than expected, however, as a result of higher earnings in various tax-free and low-tax jurisdictions in which the ECS operates.       Other issues       The MCS uses precious metal in the manufacturing of electrical contacts, rivets and other products.  Silver in particular is a primary component of many products produced by the MCS.  Historically, the Company has leased the silver and certain other metals used in its operations from banks or other financing organizations unrelated to the Company.  The rates paid for leasing precious metals have historically been substantially below the alternative financing costs that would be associated with borrowing the funds necessary to purchase the metals.  In addition, the market risk and carrying costs associated with owned precious metals inventories can be substantial.  Early in 1998, the demand for silver increased significantly and the market price of silver and the associated leasing costs also increased.  While the terms of sale within the MCS provide for sale prices to reflect the current market value of silver, the degree to which leasing and other associated costs can be recovered from customers is less certain.  The Company has thus far been successful in managing the costs associated with its precious metals and, while limited amounts have been purchased for use in production during 1998, the vast majority of its precious metal inventory continues to be leased.  If the terms and conditions of the Company's precious metal leases change significantly in a short period of time, and the Company is unable to recover these costs through higher sale prices for its products, it could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations and liquidity.                                    Page 19 of 48       The Company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year 2000 approaches and conversion to the Euro currency moves closer to a reality.  The "year 2000" problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two-digit year value to 00.  The issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date-sensitive information when the year changes to 2000.  Systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail.  The Euro conversion issue is equally complex as systems must convert local currencies to Euros and back using complex techniques.  Motivated in part by the year 2000 issue and issues related to the Euro currency conversion, but more so by the need for managers to have access to real-time business data, the MCS recently began installing a worldwide Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system.  Moreover, the Company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify, correct or reprogram, and test the systems for year 2000 compliance.  It is anticipated that all reprogramming efforts will be completed by early 1999, allowing adequate time for testing.  The total costs associated with addressing the year 2000 and Euro conversion issues cannot be accurately estimated at this time, but the Company does not believe that the costs will have a material negative impact on its results of operations, liquidity or capital resources during 1998.  The Company does not believe that the year 2000 or Euro conversion problems will pose significant operational problems for the Company's computer systems after modification and conversion. The year 2000 problem creates risks for the Company with respect to third parties with whom the Company deals with worldwide.  Failures of third parties' computer systems could have a material impact on the Company's ability to conduct its business.  The Company has begun to make inquiries of its major vendors to determine the level of their year 2000 compliance and related issues.       The Company is involved in various claims, legal actions, customs issues and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
