Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and        Results of Operations  Introduction       This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, as well as other sections of this report, contain certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to pages 10 through 13 of this report for a description of "forward-looking statements" and factors that may affect future results.       We are making the statements below to inform our shareholders of our general financial condition and our results of operations. We are not trying to influence investors to buy or sell our securities.  Business Overview       Please refer to Part I, Item I for a description of our continuing businesses and strategic initiatives.       We believe that the investments and strategies described in Part I, Item 1 have positioned us for future growth and the creation of additional shareholder value.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       Working capital at December 29, 2000 was $230.4 million, an increase of $88.5 million from the working capital of $141.9 million at December 31, 1999. Worldwide, cash on hand at December 29, 2000 was $162.6 million, approximately $74.5 million greater than at December 31, 1999 while outstanding debt decreased by approximately $11.9 million. Cash provided by operating activities was more than adequate to pay for capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividends. The operating results generated by the ECS were the primary cause for these favorable changes in our working capital, cash on hand and outstanding debt since December 31, 1999.       We believe that the combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and, if necessary, additional borrowings under our credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may use internally generated funds and additional borrowings for acquisitions of suitable businesses or assets.       All existing debt facilities mature by December 31, 2001. We believe that we can replace all available amounts at reasonable rates relative to our liquidity needs and the current credit market conditions.       At December 29, 2000, we had approximately $171.7 million of unused lines of credit from banks.                                     Page 17 of 60         Cash Flows from Operating Activities       Cash flow from operating activities was $113.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2000, an increase of $44.5 million from 1999. Net earnings before depreciation and amortization, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, contributed to cash provided by operations. Offsetting these favorable cash flow factors was an increase in accounts receivable due to record sales levels contributed by the ECS during the fourth quarter of 2000 and an increase in inventory due to a higher business levels during 2000 and a December 2000 slowdown in the telecommunication market.       Cash Flows from Investing Activities       Cash used by investing activities was $34.8 million during 2000. We used approximately $5.4 million of cash to pay for acquisitions and $30.0 million to pay for capital expenditures.       Cash payments for capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, represented approximately 4.5% of net sales during 2000 and exceeded overall depreciation by about $11.4 million. We make capital expenditures to expand production capacity and to improve our operating efficiency. Our capital expenditures in 2000 reflect a significant expansion of capacity in the ECS.       With the exception of approximately $8.5 million of retained earnings in China which are restricted by PRC regulations, substantially all retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions. We have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and none are foreseen. However, foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which some foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash movements from time to time. The retained earnings in foreign countries represent a material portion of our assets. We expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years will be abroad. If such earnings were brought back to the United States, significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the United States. This could have a material unfavorable impact on our net income and cash position.       Cash Flows from Financing Activities       During 2000, we borrowed approximately $27.3 million and repaid approximately $36.2 million of debt. We entered into an additional variable-rate Eurocurrency offering basis credit facility. This facility has a maximum draw of $5.0 million and was renewed in February 2001. We use the proceeds of this additional debt instrument to finance working capital.       We paid our 100th consecutive regular dividend in January 2001. Dividends paid in 2000 were $4.4 million compared to $4.1 million in 1999. We expect to continue making quarterly dividend payments for the foreseeable future.                                     Page 18 of 60         Foreign Currency Effects       During 2000 and 1999, the Euro devalued approximately 6% and 14%, respectively, relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we incurred foreign currency losses at our ECS European operations, as Euro denominated net assets were translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we experienced a negative translation adjustment to equity as a result of the devaluation of the Euro, as our investment in the ECPS's European operations was reduced to its U.S. dollar equivalent. This U.S. dollar decrease in investment value resulted in a reduction in equity of approximately $.2 million in 2000 and approximately $1.8 million in 1999.       During 1998, we did not experience any significant foreign currency gains or losses, but had a positive adjustment to equity of approximately $1.7 million, as a result of strengthening of the Deutsche mark and the French franc during the second half of 1998.       We transact a significant amount of sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, changing exchange rates often impact our financial results. This is particularly true of movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro because our European sales are denominated primarily in Euro currencies. In the future, it is possible that an increasing percentage of our sales will be denominated in non-U.S. currencies. This would increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.       Please see the section titled "Foreign Currency Risk" under Item 7a of this report for a description of our strategies to manage foreign currency risks.  New Accounting Pronouncements       In July 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on issue No. 00-15 ("EITF 00-15"), "Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Realized by a Company upon Employee Exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option." The EITF concluded that income tax benefits realized upon an employee's exercise of a nonqualified stock option should be classified as an operating cash flow. Accordingly, the Company has reported the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.       In July 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued No. 00-10 ("EITF 00-10"), "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs," which concluded that all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling, if any, represent revenue to the vendor and, therefore, should be classified as revenue. EITF 00-10 is effective no later than the required implementation date for SAB 101 (see below). Adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company's revenue, operating results or liquidity.                                   Page 19 of 60         In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition," which outlines criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with the SEC. SAB 101 is effective the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999 as amended by SAB 101B. Adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company's revenue, operating results or liquidity.       In June of 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. This standard was amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities." These standards are concurrently effective for quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000, and the Company adopted this standard during the first quarter of its fiscal 2001 year. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's operating results or liquidity.   Results of Operations       Our results for 2000, 1999 and 1998 are as follows. Amounts are in thousands:                                                                                    2000              1999               1998                                                                                 ----              ----               ----        Net sales:      Electronic Components                                                  $ 438,770         $ 307,351         $ 218,876      Electrical Contact Products                                              225,608           223,085           229,663                                                                             ---------         ---------         ---------          Total                                                              $ 664,378         $ 530,436         $ 448,539                                                                             =========         =========         =========  Earnings before income taxes:      Electronic Components                                                  $ 110,892         $  49,893         $  37,721      Electrical Contact Products                                               12,517            11,296            15,695      Electrical Contact Products Segment restructuring and other         non-recurring items                                                    (3,305)               --                --                                                                             ---------         ---------         ---------          Operating profit                                                     120,104            61,189            53,416      Other income (expense), net                                                2,810            (2,180)           (1,073)                                                                             ---------         ---------         ---------      Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes                $ 122,914         $  59,009         $  52,343                                                                             =========         =========         =========                                     Page 20 of 60          Revenues       Our net sales for 2000 increased by $133.9 million, or 25.3%, from 1999. We attribute the 2000 sales increase to:       o    a strong demand cycle throughout 2000 in the ECS for data networking,           telecommunications and power conversion markets; and       o    continued new product development by our customers and our related           record number of new product design wins.       Our 2000 ECS sales increased $131.4 million, or 42.8%, from the prior year. As noted above, we experienced strong demand for our products throughout 2000 due to a strong demand cycle and record number of new product design wins. Our sales growth was not impacted by acquisitions and was due to unprecedented market growth across all of our primary product areas.       Sales in the ECPS increased by $2.5 million, or 1.1%, from 1999 to 2000. The ECPS sales in 2000 were negatively affected by:       o    an average Euro-to-US dollar exchange rate that was approximately 6.5%           below the 1999 average; and       o    our sale of a non-strategic European product line.       Partially offsetting these negative sales factors was the full year of operating contributions by our 1999 acquisition of MEC Betras.       Our increase in consolidated sales from 1998 to 1999 resulted from strong demand, particularly in the second half of 1999, in ECS for components in the local area networking, telecommunication and power conversion markets, and a full year of operating contributions from FEE and GTI acquisitions. Our 1998 results included FEE contributions for approximately six months and GTI for approximately six weeks.       Cost of Sales       Gross margin for 2000 was 38.3% of sales. The comparable amounts for 1999 and 1998 are 32.4% and 31.7%, respectively.       Our margin for the ECS increased from the prior year as a result of volume efficiencies, a favorable sales mix and the full year effect of cost control programs that were instituted in the first quarter of 1999.       The ECPS margin increased slightly from the prior year due to cost reduction efforts such as Strategy 2000. Strategy 2000 is explained below. Product mix was an offsetting factor, due to a higher content of precious metals on which we realize low margins, in 2000 compared with 1999. We assume little to no price risk on sales of precious metals. For additional description of raw materials and precious metals see page 9.                                    Page 21 of 60          The increased gross margin from 1998 to 1999 was due to proportionately more sales from ECS than ECPS, even though the gross margins for both segments were individually lower in 1999 than 1998. ECS's margins were lowered due to the FEE and Valor acquisitions and related integration efforts. ECPS's margins decreased as cost reduction efforts were more than offset by weaknesses in the European markets, which caused our fixed costs to be allocated over less volume.       Operating Expenses       Our total selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding ECPS's Strategy 2000 restructuring charge in the first quarter of 2000) for 2000, 1999 and 1998 were as follows.  Amounts are in thousands:                                                       2000         1999       1998                                                     ----         ----       ----      Selling, general & administrative        expenses                                  $131,113    $110,694    $88,827       Percentage of net sales                        19.7%       20.9%      19.8%       Selling, general and administrative expense increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of sales in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily for the following reasons:       o    Compensation expense associated with performance incentive plans which           are linked to operating profits, economic profit and earnings per           share targets was $4.3 million higher in 2000 compared to 1999;       o    stock compensation plan expense which is variable in relation to our           quoted share price ($41.125 per share at the end of 2000 compared to           $22.250 per share at the end of 1999) was $4.1 million higher in 2000           compared to 1999;       o    higher spending was required to support the higher level of ECS sales;           and       o    expenses related to acquisition development and integration activity           were higher in 2000 compared to 1999.       Partially offsetting these factors was the full-year effect of the cost reduction program instituted in both segments in the first quarter of 1999 and the impact of ECPS's Strategy 2000 restructuring program that was initiated in the first quarter of 2000.       The increase in total selling, general and administrative expenses from 1998 to 1999 resulted from increased spending to support more sales volume, significantly higher expenses incurred with implementing and optimizing a global ERP system within ECPS, costs associated with integrating our most recent acquisitions, costs associated with reorganizing the ECPS business and expenses related to acquisition development activity within the ECPS.                                    Page 22 of 60          Restructuring costs and other non-recurring items totaling approximately $3.3 million, net, relate to the ECPS. Our ECPS managers realigned certain operations in 2000 to maximize market opportunities and reduce costs after an overall strategic reassessment of ECPS's business, particularly in Europe. An element of Strategy 2000 was aimed at reducing our ECPS employment levels by approximately 120 people, primarily in Germany. This reduction may be partially offset by targeted hiring of individuals dedicated to certain product lines and initiatives. Other elements of Strategy 2000 call for relocation of high-volume, repetitive production to lower-cost locations, worldwide continuous process improvement efforts, and the expansion of our more profitable and automated business based in Germany. As a result of the program, we provided approximately $3.7 million for employee severance and related payments. In addition, we recorded approximately $0.9 million of charges related to the impairment of certain assets within the ECPS and $0.9 million for other exit costs. Offsetting these Strategy 2000 costs was a gain of approximately $1.4 million related to the sale of a non-strategic European product line and a $0.8 million gain related to an insurance settlement. Both of these items also relate to the ECPS.       Although we developed the plan for Strategy 2000 during the quarter ended March 31, 2000 and announced the plan to employees, no employee termination payments were made under the plan as of that date. A total of 46 people were terminated under the plan as of December 29, 2000. It is anticipated that the majority of the employee related severance matters related to Strategy 2000 will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2001. For many of the terminated employees, severance agreements include statutory notice-period pay and a lump-sum severance payment at the end of the notice period. As many affected employees remained within the notice period during 2000, a substantial portion of the reserve was not used until severance payments were made late in 2000 and early in 2001. The savings of the plan began in 2000, although we will not realize the full benefit of the program until the completion of the part-time retirement aspect of the program. As part of Strategy 2000, approximately 65 people elected to leave the Company under a German government approved part-time retirement program. The people in the part-time retirement program will retire at varying times, the latest of which is in 2002. Cost savings from the reduction in employment levels will affect both cost of goods sold and general and administrative expenses. (See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.)                                    Page 23 of 60          We include research,  development and engineering  expenses within selling, general and  administrative  expenses.  We refer to  research,  development  and engineering  expenses  as RD&E.  RD&E by segment  for the past three years is as follows. Amounts are in thousands:                                        2000              1999               1998                                       ----              ----               ----       ECS                            $15,748           $13,972            $11,085      Percentage of segment sales       3.6%              4.6%               5.1%       ECPS                          $  4,430          $  5,639           $  5,755      Percentage of segment sales       2.0%              2.5%               2.5%       RD&E spending within the ECS increased from 1999 in absolute dollars as the ECS continues to invest in new technologies and related improvements to respond to rapid technology changes in its marketplace. As a percentage of sales, the ECS spending is less than the prior year as the ECS sales reached record levels in 2000. RD&E spending within ECPS decreased from 1999 due to the disproportionate share of RD&E required by the non-strategic European product line that was divested in the first quarter of 2000. Neither segment anticipates any significant changes to RD&E efforts in the near-term.       Interest       Interest income for 2000 was $6.3 million compared with $1.9 million in 1999 and $2.1 million in 1998. Cash and cash equivalents were substantially higher during 2000 than during 1999, and the average percentage of yield was also higher throughout 2000. Our higher level of interest income in 2000 over 1999 was also due to the majority of the increase in cash in 1999 being generated during the latter part of 1999.       For 2000, interest expense was $3.5 million compared with $3.5 million in 1999 and $3.3 million during 1998. The slight increase in interest expense in 1999 resulted from higher debt levels than 1998, particularly in the early part of 1999 as we had used debt to partially finance our November 1998 acquisition of GTI/Valor. Partially offsetting the effect of higher debt levels in 1999 was more favorable interest rates on our European debt facilities in 1999 compared to 1998.       Please see the section titled "Interest Rate Risk" under Item 7a of this report for additional information regarding interest.                                     Page 24 of 60         Income Taxes       Our effective income tax rate during 2000 was 19.2%. This compares to 24.9% in 1999 and 36.4% in 1998. The substantial decrease in our effective tax rate from 1998 to 1999 resulted from actions initiated in the first quarter of 1999 following a comprehensive global review of our business operations. This review was aimed at ensuring that our overall tax rate is optimal and appropriate. Also contributing to the lower overall tax rate was a decline in the proportion of taxable income attributable to high-tax jurisdictions such as Germany. In addition, in 2000, a higher proportion of income was earned in low-tax jurisdictions by the ECS.       We have benefited over recent years from favorable offshore tax treatments; however, there are no assurances that such treatments will continue in the future. Developing countries and, in particular, the People's Republic of China, may change their tax policies at any time. In addition to income tax policies, we monitor developments relating to other business taxes.  Other Issues       Precious Metal       The ECPS uses silver as well as other precious metals in the manufacturing of electrical contacts, rivets and other products. Historically, we have leased or held the majority of these materials through consignment arrangements with our suppliers. Our leasing and consignment costs have been substantially below the costs to borrow funds to purchase the metals. In addition, the risk of a decrease in the market price of owned precious metal can be substantial. During the first quarter of 1998, and to a lesser extent in early 1999, the price of silver increased significantly. The associated leasing costs also increased. The terms of sale within the ECPS allow us to charge customers for the current market value of silver. However, the interest expense component of leasing costs cannot always be recovered. Thus far we have been successful in managing the costs associated with our precious metals. While limited amounts were purchased during 1999 for use in production, the vast majority of our precious metal inventory continues to be leased or held on consignment. If our leasing/consignment fees increase significantly in a short period of time, and we are unable to recover these increased costs through higher sale prices, a negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity may result.

Page 25 of 60    Item 7a    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk           Our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt, are exposed to changes in interest rates in both the U.S. and abroad. We invest our excess cash with high-credit-rated financial institutions. We generally limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extent practical. Our board has adopted policies relating to these risks, and the audit committee of the board continually monitors compliance with these policies.           All of our existing credit facilities have variable interest rates. Accordingly, interest expense may increase if the rates associated with, or the amount of, our borrowings move higher. In addition, we may pursue additional or alternative financing for growth opportunities in one or both segments. We may use interest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates. However, we have not used any of these instruments to date.           The table below presents principal amounts in equivalent U.S. dollars and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its fair value after taking into consideration current rates offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. We do not hold or issue financial instruments or derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Amounts are in thousands:                                                                                                                                 Approx.

In order to reduce our exposure resulting from currency fluctuations, we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts and/or currency options. These contracts guarantee a predetermined rate of exchange at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts and currency options, we consider the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies, the type of currency, and the costs associated with the contracts. At December 29, 2000, we had a foreign exchange contract in place to sell forward $3.2 million of U.S. dollars for French francs, in connection with our purchase of the electrical contacts business of Engelhard- CLAL on January 4, 2001.
