Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Introduction       This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as well as other sections of this report, contain certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in "Risk Factors" section of this report on page 10 through 17.  Overview       Technitrol is a global producer of precision-engineered passive magnetics-based electronic components and electrical contact products and materials. We believe we are a leading global producer of these products and materials in the primary markets we serve based on our estimates of the size of our primary markets in annual revenues and our share of those markets relative to our competitors.       We operate our business in two distinct segments:  o    the electronic components segment, which operates under the name Pulse, and  o    the electrical contact products segment, which operates under the name AMI      Doduco.       General. We experienced consistent growth in net sales from fiscal 1991 through fiscal 2000. We define net sales as gross sales less returns and allowances. We sometimes refer to net sales as revenue. During the past several years, the growth in our consolidated net sales has been due in large part to the growth of Pulse. However, since late 2000, the electronics markets served by Pulse have experienced a severe global contraction. While we currently do not have a great deal of visibility with respect to future demand for our products, particularly at Pulse, we believe that the markets we serve have begun to stabilize and that a market rebound will be gradual.       Based on recent increases in the level of order activity, we are optimistic that demand for Pulse's products will gradually recover from the global slowdown in the electronics markets which began in the fourth quarter of 2000. We also believe that this recovery began in the first quarter of 2002. While Pulse's revenues in the first part of the quarter were weak, there have been indications of firming market conditions, other than in the telecommunications sector, beginning in mid-February of 2002. This is consistent with reports from our customers and peers. While the electronic components business has yet to show significant prolonged progress, Pulse's order entry rates since mid-February of 2002 have increased from their levels in late 2001. Additionally, Pulse has increased its development activities for military/aerospace applications, automotive electronics systems, and consumer electronic applications such as video game consoles.                                    Page 23 of 77           Demand has slowed at AMI Doduco, mirroring the prevailing economic conditions in North America and Europe as we entered 2002. However, AMI Doduco has seen increases in design and quoting activities for component subassemblies in Europe for automotive applications such as tire pressure monitoring systems, multi-function switches, motor control sensors and ignition security systems, and non-automotive uses such as appliance and industrial controls and medical equipment. Although some of our customers and the popular press generally report modest optimism for the second half of the year, AMI Doduco is continuing its cost reduction actions. For example, in addition to workforce adjustments in line with demand around the world, AMI Doduco is also continuing the North American plant consolidation begun in 2001, as well as the consolidation of all European contact pre-material production into our Pforzheim, Germany facility and other product and plant consolidation actions in Europe.        Historically, the gross margin at Pulse has been significantly higher than at AMI Doduco. As a result, the mix of net sales generated by Pulse and AMI Doduco during a period affects our consolidated gross margin. For example, our gross margin for the year ended December 28, 2001 was 24.1% compared to 38.3% for the year ended December 29, 2000. For the year ended December 28, 2001, Pulse generated approximately 53.4% of our consolidated net sales compared to approximately 66.0% for the year ended December 29, 2000. Our gross margin is also significantly affected by capacity utilization, particularly at AMI Doduco. Pulse has a relatively short-term product life cycle. As a result, significant product turnover occurs each year. Therefore, Pulse's changes in average selling prices do not necessarily provide a meaningful and quantifiable measure of Pulse's operations. AMI Doduco has a fairly long-term and mature product line, without significant turnover. There is minimal variation in the prices of product sold. Therefore, changes in prices do not have a material impact on AMI Doduco revenue. Accordingly, substantially all of the sales growth and contraction at AMI Doduco is attributable to changes in unit volume.       Acquisitions. Historically, acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy. In many cases, our move into new and high-growth extensions of our existing product lines or markets has been facilitated by an acquisition. Our acquisitions continually change the mix of our net sales. Pulse made numerous acquisitions in recent years which have increased its penetration into its primary markets and expanded its presence in new markets. Recent examples of these acquisitions include Excelsus, Grupo ECM and EWC. Excelsus was acquired in August 2001 for approximately $85.9 million, net of cash acquired. Excelsus is based in Carlsbad, California and is a leading North American producer of customer-premises digital subscriber line filters and other broadband accessories. Pulse acquired Electro Componentes Mexicana, which we refer to as Grupo ECM, in March 2001. Grupo ECM is a manufacturer of inductive components primarily for automotive applications. In October 2000, Pulse acquired various assets of EWC, a manufacturer of magnetic components primarily for the defense and aerospace industries.       Similarly, AMI Doduco has made a number of recent acquisitions. In January 2001, AMI Doduco acquired the electrical contact and materials business of Engelhard-CLAL, a manufacturer of electrical contacts, wire and strip contact materials and related products. In addition, in fiscal 2000, AMI Doduco acquired a tool and mold fabrication facility in Estonia and in fiscal 1999 it acquired MEC Betras Italia, a producer of electrical contact rivets and                                    Page 24 of 77      stamped electrical contact parts, located near Milan, Italy. These acquisitions were driven by our strategy of expanding our product and geographical market presence for electrical contact products. Due to our quick integration of acquisitions and the interchangeable sources of net sales between existing and acquired operations, we do not separately track the net sales of an acquisition after the date of the transaction.       Recent Cost Reduction Programs. During 1999 and 2000, the electronic components industry served by Pulse was characterized by unprecedented growth. Beginning in late 2000 and continuing all during 2001, however, the opposite trend was experienced as these industries experienced a severe worldwide contraction and many of our customers canceled orders and decreased their level of business activity as a result of lower demand for their end products. While the electrical contact industry served by AMI Doduco is generally less dependent on volatile technology markets, it too was negatively impacted by general economic trends as reflected in slower housing starts, capital spending and automotive sales both in the United States and western Europe.       Our manufacturing business model at Pulse has a very high variable cost component due to the labor-intensity of many processes. This allows us to quickly change our capacity based on market demand. Just as we expanded capacity during 1999 and 2000, we reduced capacity during 2001. We implemented numerous restructuring initiatives during 2001 in order to further reduce Pulse's cost structure and capacity, although the speed and depth of the contraction in Pulse's markets made it impossible to reduce costs at the same rate at which revenues contracted throughout 2001. During the second quarter of 2001, we announced the closure of our production facility in Thailand and during the third quarter, we announced the closure of our production facility in Malaysia. The production at these two facilities was transferred to other Pulse facilities in Asia. We provided reserves of $3.6 million for these plant closings, comprised of $2.5 million for severance and related payments and $1.1 million for other exit costs. The majority of this accrual will be utilized by the end of the first quarter of 2002.       We also adopted other restructuring plans during 2001. In this regard, provisions of $6.4 million were recorded during 2001. Approximately 3,500 manufacturing personnel primarily in Asia, and approximately 200 support personnel in North America and Europe were terminated. Approximately 75% of all of the employee severance and related payments in connection with these actions were completed as of December 28, 2001. Approximately $2.3 million of the provision remains as of December 28, 2001 for severance payments and related expenses to be made during 2002. An additional $0.7 million remains accrued at December 28, 2001 for other exit costs in primarily Thailand and Malaysia. Termination costs for employees at our Thailand and Malaysian facilities have been included in the separate provisions for exiting those facilities. In addition to these terminations, headcount was reduced by approximately 12,300 additional personnel, net of new hires, during fiscal 2001 through voluntary employee attrition and involuntary work force reductions, primarily at manufacturing facilities in the PRC where severance payments are not necessary. Accordingly, on a consolidated basis, our employee base dropped from approximately 30,600 as of December 29, 2000 to approximately 14,800 as of December 28, 2001.                                    Page 25 of 77           We recorded pre-tax inventory provisions in cost of sales of $20.3 million for the year ended December 28, 2001. The provisions were recorded throughout each quarter of 2001, although the fourth quarter had the most significant impact. The amounts were determined by comparing quantity on-hand to actual historical usage and forecasted demand for 2002. The inventory that was fully reserved in 2001 was primarily raw materials and specific finished goods for several customers. In addition, a charge of $3.5 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2001 to write down the value of certain Pulse fixed assets to their disposal value. These assets include Asian-based production equipment that became idle in 2001 due to the contraction of Pulse's business. The assets have been marketed through the liquidation market, and the majority have either been sold for their residual value or scrapped. The remaining cost basis of the assets has been reclassified from fixed assets to assets held for sale in the balance sheet as of December 28, 2001. Additional inventory and fixed asset write-downs are expected if demand for electronic components decreases in the future.       Total restructuring and unusual and infrequent items for the year ended December 28, 2001 includes $3.6 million related to the Thailand and Malaysia plant closings, $6.4 million for other restructuring plans and $3.5 million for the write down of Pulse fixed assets.       Approximately $0.5 million for AMI Doduco restructuring actions is included in the aggregate charge of $6.4 million noted above. The capital-intensity of AMI Doduco makes quick changes in its cost structure more challenging than at Pulse. In the quarter ended March 31, 2000, AMI Doduco recorded a $5.5 million provision for restructuring initiatives due to a reduction in employment levels by approximately 120 people, primarily in Germany. In addition, the AMI Doduco restructuring initiative provided for the relocation of high-volume, repetitive production to lower-cost locations, worldwide continuous process improvement efforts, and the expansion of our more profitable and automated business based in Germany. As a result of the program, we provided $3.7 million for employee severance and related payments, $0.9 million related to the impairment of certain assets and $0.9 million for other exit costs. Offsetting these costs was a gain of $1.4 million related to the sale of a non-strategic European product line and a $0.8 million gain related to an insurance settlement.       As a result of our core business focus on both economic and operating profit, we will continue to aggressively size both Pulse and AMI Doduco so that costs are minimized during market downturn, while we plan for the recovery in demand and pursue additional growth opportunities. We expect to undertake additional cost reduction actions during the first two quarters of 2002, the extent of which will be determined by the timing and degree of a recovery in our markets and the economy in general. We anticipate that Pulse's restructuring efforts will continue into, and be completed by the end of, the second quarter of 2002 and will consist largely of additional capacity consolidation and reductions in operating expenses, including further employment reductions. AMI Doduco also plans to undertake further consolidation activities into the second quarter of 2002 consisting mainly of employment reductions. While we do not currently anticipate significant cost reduction actions past the second quarter of 2002, they may occur if there is not a recovery in our markets and in the economy in general. If additional actions are undertaken, the amounts                                    Page 26 of 77      will depend on specific actions taken to reduce manufacturing capacity and improve efficiency.       Our restructuring charges are summarized on a year-to-date basis for 2001 as follows:                                                                             AMI       Restructuring provision (in millions):                          Doduco             Pulse               Total       -----------------------                                         ------             -----               -----              Balance accrued at December 29, 2000                            $  2.5            $  --              $   2.5       Accrued during the year ended December 28, 2001                    0.5               13.1               13.6       Severance and other cash payments                                 (2.2)              (7.2)              (9.4)       Non-cash asset disposals                                          (0.2)              (3.5)              (3.7)                                                                       ------            -------            -------       Balance accrued at December 28, 2001                            $  0.6            $   2.4            $   3.0                                                                       ======            =======            =======        International Operations. An increasing percentage of our sales in recent years has been outside of the United States. As of December 28, 2001, we have operations in 12 countries and we have significant net sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 28, 2001, 64.9% of our net sales were outside of the U.S. For the year ended December 29, 2000, 55.5% of our net sales were to customers outside of the U.S. As a result, changing exchange rates often impact our financial results and the analysis of our period-over-period results. This is particularly true of movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. AMI Doduco's European sales are denominated primarily in euros. A portion of Pulse's European sales are also denominated in euros. However, the proportion at Pulse is much less than it is at AMI Doduco. As a result of this and other factors, Pulse uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency in Europe while AMI Doduco uses the euro. The use of different functional currencies creates different financial effects. The euro was 3.3% weaker, on average, relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 28, 2001 than in the comparable prior-year period. As a result, AMI Doduco's euro-denominated sales resulted in lower dollar sales upon translation for our U.S. consolidated financial statements. We also experienced a negative translation adjustment to equity in the 2001 period because our investment in AMI Doduco's European operations was worth less in U.S. dollars. At Pulse, we incurred foreign currency losses as euro denominated assets and liabilities were remeasured to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes during 2001. If an increasing percentage of our sales are denominated in non-U.S. currencies, it could increase our exposure to currency fluctuations. The impact of exchange rate differences on AMI Doduco's European sales will be partially offset by the impact on its expenses and bank borrowings in Europe, most of which are also denominated in euros. Despite Pulse's significant presence in Asia, the vast majority of its revenues from customers in Asia are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, Pulse has less exposure than AMI Doduco to sales fluctuations caused by currency fluctuations.       In order to reduce our exposure resulting from currency fluctuations, we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts and/or currency options. These contracts guarantee a predetermined range of exchange rates at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. As of December 28, 2001, we had five foreign currency                                    Page 27 of 77      forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately 44.2 million of euro in the aggregate in order to hedge intercompany loans. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts and currency options, we consider the amount of sales, purchases and net assets or liabilities denominated in local currencies, the type of currency, and the costs associated with the contracts.       Precious Metals. AMI Doduco uses silver, as well as other precious metals, in manufacturing some of its electrical contacts, contact materials and contact subassemblies. Historically, we have leased or held these materials through consignment arrangements with our suppliers. Leasing and consignment costs have been substantially below the costs to borrow funds to purchase the metals and these arrangements eliminate the fluctuations in the market price of owned precious metal. AMI Doduco's terms of sale generally allow us to charge customers for the market value of silver on the day after we deliver the silver bearing product to the customer. Thus far we have been successful in managing the costs associated with our precious metals. While limited amounts are purchased for use in production, the majority of our precious metal inventory continues to be leased or held on consignment. If our leasing/consignment fees increase significantly in a short period of time, and we are unable to recover these increased costs through higher sale prices, a negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity may result. Leasing/consignment fee increases are caused by increases in interest rates or increases in the price of the consigned material. See additional discussion in note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in high-tax jurisdictions such as Germany and the income earned in low-tax jurisdictions, particularly in Asia. This mix of income can vary significantly from one period to another. We have benefited over recent years from favorable offshore tax treatments. However, we may not be able to take advantage of similar benefits in the future. Developing countries and, in particular, the People's Republic of China, may change their tax policies at any time. During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, we initiated a number of actions aimed at ensuring that our overall tax rate is optimal and appropriate. These actions followed a comprehensive global review of our business operations and tax planning opportunities. The effect of these actions was a reduction in our effective tax rate.       We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $294.0 million of our non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings (as calculated for income tax purposes) as of December 28, 2001. Such earnings include pre-acquisition earnings of foreign entities acquired through stock purchases, and are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. It is not practical to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings. Where excess cash has accumulated in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and it is advantageous for tax reasons, subsidiary earnings may be remitted.                                    Page 28 of 77      Results of Operations     Year ended December 28, 2001 compared to the year ended December 29, 2000       Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended December 28, 2001 decreased $190.2 million, or 28.6%, to $474.2 million from $664.4 million in the year ended December 29, 2000. Our sales decline from the comparable period last year was attributable primarily to the precipitous global downturn in markets served by Pulse that began late in 2000. Factors contributing to the downturn included declining capital expenditures by end-users and subsequent excess inventory levels. This downturn was experienced in Pulse's networking, telecommunications and power conversion markets on a worldwide basis, particularly in North America and Europe.        Pulse's net sales decreased $185.5 million, or 42.3%, to $253.3 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 from $438.8 million in the year ended December 29, 2000. Pulse's sales were significantly lower in 2001 than in 2000 as new order rates declined and significant customer order cancellations occurred. Net sales in 2001 include sales derived from our acquisitions of Grupo ECM and Excelsus since the date of their acquisition in March and August 2001, respectively.       AMI Doduco's net sales decreased $4.7 million, or 2.1%, to $220.9 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 from $225.6 million in the year ended December 29, 2000. Sales in the 2001 period reflect strong European markets and contributions from the Engelhard-CLAL operations, acquired in early January 2001. However, these positive factors were offset by a slowdown in North American manufacturing activity during the year ended December 28, 2001, and to a lesser extent, a decline in the average euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. The lower manufacturing activity resulted in lower net sales primarily from customers in the commercial and industrial machinery, telecommunications and appliance industries.       Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales decreased $50.2 million, or 12.2%, to $359.7 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 from $409.9 million for the year ended December 29, 2000. This decrease was due to a decrease in net sales. Our consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 28, 2001 was 24.1% compared to 38.3% for the year ended December 29, 2000. Since the Pulse gross profit as a percentage of sales is typically higher than that of AMI Doduco, our consolidated gross margin in 2001 was negatively affected by:       o    a mix of net sales weighted more heavily by AMI Doduco on a relative           basis,       o    manufacturing inefficiencies at both Pulse and AMI Doduco due to           under-utilization of capacity as a result of the market downturn, and       o    provisions for slow moving inventory at Pulse due to business           slowdown.       These factors more than offset the positive impact of our restructuring initiatives.       Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 28, 2001 decreased $32.3 million, or 24.6%, to $98.8 million, or 20.8% of net sales, from $131.1 million, or 19.7% net of sales                                    Page 29 of 77      for the year ended December 29, 2000. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2001 was due to aggressive action that we took to reduce costs and tighten spending controls. For example, selling expenses, which are largely variable with net sales, decreased $3.1 million from 2000 to 2001. Administrative expenses decreased by $30.2 million, due largely to reduced headcount and lower incentive awards and lower expenses related to our restricted stock plan in 2001. These decreases were partially offset by higher research, development and engineering expenses, which increased by $1.0 million from 2001. The underlying expense for incentive awards is primarily variable and dependent upon our overall financial performance regarding incentive plan targets, primarily the achievement of economic profit and net operating profit objectives. These targets, which were set in December of 2000, were not achieved, and consequently, except for a small payment by AMI Doduco in the first quarter of 2001, no cash incentives were paid to executives. These incentive awards were $0.5 million in 2001 compared to $9.4 million in 2000. Expenses associated with stock-based compensation plans including the restricted stock plan were also significantly lower in 2001 versus the year ended December 29, 2000, due to a lower average share price of our common stock throughout 2001 compared to 2000. These expenses were approximately $1.2 million in 2001 compared to $7.0 million in 2000.       Research, development and engineering expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We refer to research, development and engineering expenses as RD&E. For the years ended December 28, 2001 and December 29, 2000, RD&E by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):                                                     2001               2000                                                   ----               ----       Pulse                                      $16,026            $15,748      Percentage of segment sales                   6.3%               3.6%       AMI Doduco                                 $ 4,155            $ 4,430      Percentage of segment sales                   1.9%               2.0%       Although 2001 had been characterized by cost reduction activities and much lower sales levels, particularly at Pulse, we largely avoided spending cuts in the RD&E area as we believe that the recovery in the electronic components markets will be driven by next-generation products. Design and development activities with our OEM customers continued at an aggressive pace during 2001.       Interest. Net interest income was $1.4 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 29, 2000. Invested cash balances remained essentially consistent with the year ended December 29, 2000, due to the intense focus on cash management throughout 2001. This resulted in preservation of average cash balances throughout 2001. Outstanding debt increased during the year ended December 28, 2001 due primarily to $74.0 million that was incurred in connection with the acquisition of Excelsus in August 2001, resulting in increased interest expense.       Our new credit facility, which was entered into on June 20, 2001, has variable interest rates. Accordingly, interest expense may increase if the rates associated with, or                                    Page 30 of 77      the amounts borrowed under, our credit facilities move higher during subsequent quarters. We may use interest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates; however, we have not used any such instruments to date.       Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 28, 2001 was 54.1% compared to 19.2% for the year ended December 29, 2000. The higher tax rate in 2001 resulted from the non-deductibility of certain restructuring charges incurred in 2001. Specifically, plant shut-down costs and severance expenses were incurred in low-tax jurisdictions or countries where we have current losses or where we will not have operations in the future. Thus, we expect to have no future income to offset such charges, resulting in little or no income tax benefit. In addition, a higher proportion of income was earned in high-tax jurisdictions.     Year ended December 29, 2000 compared to the year ended December 31, 1999       Net Sales. Net sales in year ended December 29, 2000 increased $133.9 million, or 25.3%, to $664.4 million from $530.4 million in the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase was attributable to:       o    a strong demand cycle throughout 2000 in Pulse markets for data           networking, telecommunications and power conversion, and       o    continued new product development by our customers and our related           record number of new product design wins.       Pulse's net sales increased $131.4 million, or 42.8%, to $438.8 million in the year ended December 29, 2000 from $307.4 million in the year ended December 31, 1999. This sales growth was not impacted by acquisitions and was due to unprecedented market growth across all of our primary product areas.       AMI Doduco's net sales increased $2.5 million, or 1.1%, to $225.6 million in the year ended December 29, 2000 from $223.1 million in the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase was due to strong market growth in our primary product areas. Despite the increase, AMI Doduco's net sales in the year ended December 29, 2000 were negatively affected by:       o    an average euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate that was 6.5% below the           1999 average, and       o    our sale of a non-strategic European product line.       Partially offsetting these negative sales factors was the full year of operating contributions by our acquisition of MEC Betras made in December 1999.       Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales increased $51.3 million, or 14.3%, to $409.9 million in the year ended December 29, 2000 from $358.6 million in the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase resulted from higher net sales in the year ended December 29, 2000. Our consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 29, 2000 was 38.3% compared to 32.4% in the year ended December 31, 1999. Pulse's gross                                    Page 31 of 77      margin increased from the prior year as a result of volume efficiencies, a favorable sales mix and the full year effect of cost control programs that were instituted in the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 1999. AMI Doduco's gross margin increased slightly from the prior year due to our cost reduction efforts. Product mix was an offsetting factor, due to a higher content of precious metals, on which we realize low margins, in the year ended December 29, 2000 compared with the year ended December 31, 1999.       Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 29, 2000 increased $20.4 million, or 18.4%, to $131.1 million, or 19.7% of net sales, from $110.7 million, or 20.9% of net sales, in the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to the following reasons:       o    compensation expense associated with cash performance incentive plans,           which are linked to operating profits, economic profit and earnings           per share targets was $4.3 million higher in the year ended December           29, 2000 compared to the year ended December 31, 1999;       o    stock compensation plan expense, which is variable in relation to our           quoted share price, was $4.1 million higher in the year ended December           29, 2000 compared to the year ended December 31, 1999;       o    higher spending was required to support the higher level of Pulse           sales including increases of $1.5 million related to selling expenses           such as commissions and other expenses that largely vary with sales;       o    administrative expenses, including the stock and incentive           compensation-related items noted above, increased $18.9 million; and       o    expenses related to acquisition development and integration activity           such as travel and consulting were higher in the year ended December           29, 2000 compared to the year ended December 31, 1999.       Increases noted above are shown net of the effect of our expense reduction programs, particularly the reduction in employment levels by approximately 120 people. The annual salary and benefit costs associated with these people was approximately $4.8 million.       For the year ended December 29, 2000 and December 31, 1999, RD&E by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):                                                   2000              1999                                                  ----              ----        Pulse                                    $15,748           $13,972       Percentage of segment sales                 3.6%              4.6%        AMI Doduco                               $ 4,430           $ 5,639       Percentage of segment sales                 2.0%              2.5%       RD&E spending within Pulse increased from the year ended December 31, 1999 in absolute dollars as Pulse continued to invest in new technologies and related improvements                                    Page 32 of 77      to respond to rapid technology changes in its marketplace. As a percentage of sales, Pulse spending in the year ended December 29, 2000 was less than the year ended December 31, 1999 as Pulse's sales reached record levels in the year ended December 29, 2000. RD&E spending within AMI Doduco decreased from the year ended December 31, 1999 due to the disproportionate share of RD&E required by the non-strategic European product line that was divested in the first quarter of fiscal 2000.       Interest. Interest income for the year ended December 29, 2000 was $6.3 million compared with $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 1999. Cash and cash equivalents were substantially higher during the year ended December 29, 2000 than during the year ended December 31, 1999, and the average percentage of yield was also higher throughout the year ended December 29, 2000. Our higher level of interest income in the year ended December 29, 2000 over the year ended December 31, 1999 was also due to the majority of the increase in cash in the year ended December 31, 1999 being generated during the latter part of 1999.       For the year ended December 29, 2000, interest expense was $3.5 million, essentially the same as in the year ended December 31, 1999.       Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate during the year ended December 29, 2000 was 19.2%. This compares to 24.9% in the year ended December 31, 1999. For the year ended December 29, 2000, a higher proportion of income was earned in low-tax jurisdictions by Pulse.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       Working capital as of December 28, 2001 was $189.3 million compared to $230.4 million as of December 29, 2000. This decrease was primarily due to lower accounts receivable and inventory levels during 2001. Cash and cash equivalents, which is included in working capital, decreased from $162.6 million as of December 29, 2000 to $142.3 million as of December 28, 2001.       Net cash from operating activities was $62.7 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 and $113.8 million in 2000, a decrease of $51.1 million. In 2000, our cash flow from operations was primarily driven by increasing net earnings. During the year ended December 28, 2001, net earnings declined as a result of the dramatic slowdown in the markets served by Pulse. However, the lower earnings have been partially offset by decreased working capital requirements and aggressive cash management actions that we took in response to the slowdown. A significant decrease in Pulse's net sales during the year ended December 28, 2001 caused a significant decrease in accounts receivable. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulted from payments made for income taxes and compensation related items, as well as a lower level of trade accounts payable due to reduced production. Net of the effect of acquisitions, inventory declined by $28.7 million during the year ended December 28, 2001 due to the significant reduction in Pulse's net sales during the period and corresponding actions to limit purchases and production activity. The reduction in inventory also reflects $20.3 million of provisions for inventory during the year ended December 28, 2001.                                    Page 33 of 77           Capital expenditures were $13.2 million during the year ended December 28, 2001 and $30.0 million in 2000. The level of capital expenditures decreased from the year ended December 29, 2000, due to tight spending controls and lower Pulse capacity needs resulting from lower sales. During the year ended December 28, 2001, capital spending was $6.0 million in the first quarter, $2.7 million in the second quarter, $1.8 million in the third quarter and $2.7 million in the fourth quarter, as our efforts to maximize cash flow during this period of slow market activity intensified. We significantly reduced our capital spending in 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 and expect that our spending in 2002 may be less than in 2001. We make capital expenditures to expand production capacity and to improve our operating efficiency. We plan to continue making such expenditures in the future.       Cash used for acquisitions was $120.3 million for the year ended December 28, 2001 and $5.4 million for the comparable period in 2000. The 2001 spending includes the August 2001 acquisition of Excelsus for approximately $90.7 million, including cash acquired of $4.8 million. We may acquire other businesses or product lines to expand our breadth and scope of operations.       We paid dividends of $4.5 million in the year ended December 28, 2001 and $4.4 million in the year ended December 29, 2000. We received proceeds of $6.5 million during the year ended December 28, 2001 and $8.4 million in the year ended December 29, 2000 from the sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan. We do not expect to continue receiving significant proceeds through our employee stock purchase plan in the near term. After paying a dividend on January 25, 2002 to shareholders of record on January 4, 2002, we no longer intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings to finance the growth of our business.       All previous credit facilities and lines of credit, excluding fixed term loans, were replaced as of June 20, 2001 under a new three-year revolving credit agreement providing for $225.0 million of credit capacity. The credit facility consists of:       o    a U.S. dollar-based revolving line of credit in the principal amount           of up to $225.0 million;       o    a British pounds sterling-based or euro-based revolving line of credit           in the principal amount of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $100.0           million; and       o    a multicurrency facility providing for the issuance of letters of           credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed the U.S. dollar equivalent           of $10.0 million.       The amounts outstanding under the credit facility in total may not exceed $225.0 million.       We pay a facility fee irrespective of whether there are outstanding borrowings or not, which ranges from 0.275% to 0.450% of the total commitment, depending on our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, ("EBITDA"). The interest rate for each currency's borrowing will be a combination of the base rate for that currency plus a credit margin spread. The base rate is different for each currency: LIBOR or prime rate for U.S. dollars, Euro-LIBOR for euros, and a rate approximating sterling LIBOR for British pounds. The credit margin spread is the same for each currency and is                                    Page 34 of 77      0.850% to 1.425% depending on our debt to EBITDA ratio. Each of our domestic subsidiaries with net worth equal to or greater than $5 million has agreed to guarantee all obligations incurred under the credit facility. The credit facility also contains covenants requiring maintenance of minimum net worth, maximum debt to EBITDA ratio, minimum interest expense coverage, capital expenditure limitations, and other customary and normal provisions. We are in compliance with all such covenants.       Our German indirect subsidiary, AMI Doduco GmbH, has obligations outstanding under two term loan agreements. The first is with Baden-Wurttembergische Bank for the borrowing of two loans, each in the amount of 10 million Deutsche marks, both due in June 2003. The second is with Sparkasse Pforzheim, for the borrowing of 10 million Deutsche marks, and is due in August 2009. We and several of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations arising under these term loan agreements.       We believe that the combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and, if necessary, additional borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements in the short-term and long-term. In addition, we may use internally generated funds or borrowings, or additional equity offerings for acquisitions of suitable businesses or assets.       With the exception of approximately $10.0 million of retained earnings as of December 28, 2001 in the PRC that are restricted in accordance with Section 58 of the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprises Law, substantially all retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions. The amount restricted in accordance with the PRC Foreign Investment Enterprise Law is for employee welfare programs and is applicable to all foreign investment enterprises doing business in the PRC. The restriction applies to 10% of our net earnings in the PRC, limited to 50% of the total capital invested in the PRC. We have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and none are foreseen. However, foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which some foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash movements from time to time. The retained earnings in other countries represent a material portion of our assets. We expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years will be abroad. If these earnings were brought back to the United States, significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the United States as several countries in which we operate have rates significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Additionally, we have not accrued U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings indefinitely invested abroad. We have also been granted special tax incentives in other countries such as the PRC and the Philippines. This favorable situation could change if these countries were to increase rates or revoke the special tax incentives, or if we were to discontinue manufacturing operations in these countries. This could have a material unfavorable impact on our net income and cash position.       We commenced an intercompany lending program during the year ended December 28, 2001, whereby excess U.S. dollar denominated cash is being used to retire euro denominated debt. The benefit derived from this program is lower net interest expense, as the U.S. dollar interest income rates have been decreasing, while the euro interest expense rates have declined less rapidly.                                    Page 35 of 77           At December 28, 2001, we had approximately $150.0 million of unused line credit available under the credit agreement, although outstanding borrowings are limited to a maximum multiple of three times EBITDA on a rolling twelve-month basis.  New Accounting Pronouncements       In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, ("SFAS 144") which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. While SFAS 144 supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, ("SFAS 121") it retains many of the fundamental provisions of SFAS 121. SFAS 144 also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations--Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, ("APB 30"). SFAS 144 does however, retain the requirement in APB 30 to report separately discontinued operations, and extends this reporting requirement to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale, abandonment, or in a distribution to owners; or is classified as held for sale. Goodwill is excluded from the scope of SFAS 144. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 144 during the three months ending March 29, 2002. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our revenue, operating results or liquidity.       In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS 143") which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or) normal use of the assets. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss on settlement will be recognized. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 during the three months ending March 28, 2003. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our net sales, operating results or liquidity.       In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, Business Combinations, ("SFAS 141") and Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also specifies that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet certain criteria to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead they are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. SFAS 142 will also require                                    Page 36 of 77      that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144.       We are adopting the provisions of SFAS 141 immediately, and SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. Furthermore, any goodwill and any intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after June 30, 2001 are not amortized, but will continue to be evaluated for permanent impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 were amortized until December 28, 2001. Since our acquisition of Excelsus was completed on August 7, 2001, the provisions of SFAS 141 were applied. Therefore, goodwill and certain intangibles with indefinite lives resulting from the Excelsus transaction have not been subject to amortization.       In connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation, SFAS 142 requires us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption. To accomplish this, we must determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the date of adoption. We then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit's carrying amount. To the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test. In the second step, we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with SFAS 141, to its carrying amount. This second step is required to be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the year of adoption. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of earnings.       We had approximately $80.3 million of unamortized goodwill and $48.2 million of other intangible assets as of December 28, 2001, which will be subject to the transition provisions of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142. Amortization expense was approximately $5.4 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 28, 2001 and December 29, 2000, respectively. We are performing the transitional impairment test and currently estimate that an impairment loss of approximately $16.0 to $19.0 million will be recorded in the first quarter of 2002. This loss will be recognized as a cumulative effect of an accounting principle change.  Item 7a Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk       Our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt, are exposed to changes in interest rates in both the U.S. and abroad. We invest our excess cash in short-term, investment grade interest bearing securities. We generally limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extent practical. Our board has adopted                                    Page 37 of 77      policies relating to these risks, and the audit committee of the board continually monitors compliance with these policies.       Our existing credit facilities have variable interest rates. Accordingly, interest expense may increase if the rates associated with, or the amount of, our borrowings move higher. In addition, we may pursue additional or alternative financing for growth opportunities in one or both segments. We may use interest rate swaps or other financial derivatives in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates. However, we have not used any of these instruments to date.       The table below presents principal amounts in U.S. dollars (or equivalent U.S. dollars with respect to non-U.S. denominated debt) and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations. The column captioned "Approximate Fair Value" sets forth the carrying value of our long-term debt as of December 28, 2001, which approximates its fair value at such date after taking into consideration current rates offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. We do not hold or issue financial instruments or derivative financial instruments for trading purposes (dollars in thousands):                                                                                                                        Approx.

However, we conduct business in various foreign currencies, including those of emerging market countries in Asia and well-developed European countries. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily forward exchange contracts and currency options, to manage foreign currency risks. In accordance with SFAS 133, gains and losses related to qualified hedges of firm commitments and anticipated transactions are deferred and are recognized in income or as adjustments of carrying amounts when the hedged transactions occurs. All other forward exchange and options contracts are marked-to-market and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income. These contracts guarantee a predetermined rate of exchange at the time the contract is purchased. This allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee. We believe there are two potential risks of holding these instruments. The first is that the foreign currency being hedged could move in a direction which could create a better economic outcome than if hedging had not taken place. The second risk is that the counterparty to a currency hedge defaults on its obligations. We                                    Page 38 of 77      reduce the risk of counterparty default by entering into relatively short-term hedges with well capitalized and highly rated banks. In determining the use of forward exchange contracts and currency options, we consider the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies, the type of currency and the costs associated with the contracts. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2001, we began to employ foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency risks associated with intercompany loans. As of December 28, 2001, we had five foreign exchange forward contracts with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $39.3 million outstanding on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis. The terms of these contracts were from one to six months. We did not have any other financial derivative instruments as of December 28, 2001.
