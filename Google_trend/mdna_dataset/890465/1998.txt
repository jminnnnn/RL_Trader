ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.    The following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of NPS should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.   Overview    Since its inception in 1986, NPS has devoted substantially all of its resources to its research and development programs. To date, the Company has not completed development of any pharmaceutical product for sale and has incurred substantial losses. NPS has incurred cumulative losses through December 31, 1997 of $26.1 million, net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of $48.5 million. The Company expects to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as the Company continues and expands its research and development and preclinical and clinical testing activities. Substantially all of the Company's revenues are derived from license fees, milestone payments and research and development support payments from its licensees and these revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, the Company expects that income or loss will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, that such fluctuations may be substantial, and that results from prior quarters may not be indicative of future operating results. The Company's ability to achieve profitability depends in part on its ability, alone and/or with others and the efforts of its licensees, to complete development of its products, to obtain the required regulatory approvals and to manufacture and market such products, as to which matters there can be no assurance.   Results of Operations    Substantially all of the Company's revenues of $9.6 million, $20.3 million and $5.8 million in 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively, were derived from research and license agreements. The Company recognized $3.4 million in 1995, $5.7 million in 1996 and $1.9 million in 1997 under the terms of its agreement with SmithKline Beecham; $6.0 million in 1995, $4.0 million in 1996, and $3.5 million in 1997 under the terms of its agreement with Kirin; and $10.6 million in 1996 and $400,000 in 1997 under the terms of its agreement with Amgen. These revenues were derived from a combination of one-time license fees, milestone payments and research and development support payments and are not indicative of future revenue that may be earned under these agreements. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for further discussion of payments that may be received by the Company in the future under these agreements.    Research and development expenses increased from $8.7 million in 1995 to $11.3 million in 1996 and $15.1 million in 1997. The increases in research and development expenses were principally due to the conduct of increasingly expensive clinical trials for R-568 in 1995 and early 1996, the preclinical development of NPS 1506 in 1996 and early 1997, the conduct of clinical trials for NPS 1506 commencing in mid-1997 and increased personnel costs throughout the three years. Research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase in the future as NPS conducts discovery, preclinical development and clinical trials for non-licensed product candidates, sponsors research or obtains licenses for technology, product candidates or products from private commercial entities, academia or research institutions and hires more research and development personnel.    General and administrative expenses increased from $4.0 million in 1995 to $5.1 million in 1996 and $5.6 million in 1997. The increases were primarily due to hiring of additional personnel in the areas of business development, investor relations and legal affairs in 1996 and costs associated with a follow-on offering of the Company's common stock which was completed in May 1996. The Company expects that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as more personnel and facilities are needed to support research and development activities.    Interest income increased from $480,000 in 1995 to $2.7 million in 1996 and $3.4 million in 1997 primarily due to a higher average cash balance resulting from the net proceeds of the follow-on offering of common stock in May 1996. The Company anticipates that interest income will decrease in the future as the Company's cash is utilized for operations.                                        27     Income tax expense of $500,000 in 1995, $200,000 in 1996 and $200,000 in 1997 resulted from a 10% Japanese tax withheld on the license fee and milestone payments by Kirin, and U.S. alternative minimum tax of $118,000 incurred on net income in 1996 and paid in 1997. Future milestone and royalty payments from Kirin will be subject to the same 10% tax.    As of December 31, 1997, the Company had a federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately $23.2 million and a federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately $2.1 million. The Company's ability to utilize these operating loss and research credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the "change in ownership rules" under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. See Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.   Liquidity and Capital Resources    The Company has financed its operations since inception primarily through collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public placement of equity securities. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had recognized $48.5 million of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements and $86.4 million in consideration for the sale of equity securities for cash and services. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investment securities which totaled $57.9 million at December 31, 1997.    The Company receives quarterly research and/or development support payments under its agreements with Amgen, Kirin and SmithKline Beecham. Such payments are scheduled to aggregate $8.7 million through the scheduled expiration dates of the agreements in December, June and October 2000, respectively. In addition, SmithKline Beecham will purchase 453,000 shares of NPS common stock at a premium to the market price if the research agreement is not terminated early.    The Company could receive future payments of up to $49.0 million in the aggregate from Amgen, Kirin, and SmithKline Beecham upon the accomplishment of specified research and/or development milestones under the respective agreements. NPS does not control the subject matter, timing or resources applied by its licensees under their respective development programs. Thus, the Company's potential receipt of milestone payments from these licensees is largely beyond the control of NPS. Progress under these agreements is subject to risk and each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee. No assurance can be given that any future milestone or research or development support payments will be received from any of them or under any other licensing agreement then in effect.    The Company has entered into certain sponsored research and license agreements that obligate the Company to make research support payments to academic and/or commercial research institutions. Additional payments may be required upon the accomplishment of research milestones by the institutions, or as license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had a total commitment of approximately $3.2 million for future research support payments. The Company expects to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future.    As of December 31, 1997, the Company's investment in leasehold improvements, equipment and furnishings was $4.0 million, net of depreciation. The Company has financed a portion of such expenditures through capital leases and long- term debt with a total principal obligation of $392,000 as of December 31, 1997, of which $330,000 is classified as short term. Additional equipment and facilities will be needed as the Company increases its research and development activities, a portion of which may be financed with debt or leases. Equipment and leasehold improvements subject to the capital leases and long-term debt have been pledged in support of such obligations.    The Company anticipates that its existing capital resources, including interest earned thereon and expected research and development support payments and equity purchases from its licensees, will be sufficient to enable it to maintain its current and planned operations for at least 24 months. However, actual needs are dependent on numerous factors, including the progress of the Company's current and future research and development                                        28   programs, the magnitude and scope of these activities, progress with preclinical and clinical trials, the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, competing technological and market developments, changes in or terminations of existing research and license arrangements, the establishment of additional license arrangements, the cost of manufacturing scale-up and development of marketing activities, if undertaken by the Company. Furthermore, in the event the Company were to in-license or otherwise acquire a product candidate in clinical development, substantial expenditures for clinical trials and regulatory submissions would be required. Substantial expenditures will be required to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacture or have manufactured and market any proprietary products of NPS that may be derived from current research and development efforts and perform research and development activities in additional areas. In addition, if any licensee terminates its agreement, the Company may not have sufficient capital to complete the development and commercialization of a product in the respective territory. A reduction in the expected amount of research and development support payments or equity purchases may shorten the period during which the Company could maintain its operations or require the Company to reduce its operations.    NPS may need to raise additional funds to support its long-term product development and commercialization programs. The Company is presently seeking additional funding for certain of its current programs through corporate collaborations and licensing agreements. The Company may also seek additional funding through public or private financing. There can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research and development programs or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies, product candidates or products that the Company may otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own.   Year 2000 Assessment    The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the year 2000 on its operations and systems. Management has developed assessment procedures and a plan to address identified issues within the Company. The Company does not yet know the extent, if any, of the impact of the year 2000 on its systems and equipment. There can be no assurance that third parties, such as suppliers, clinical research organizations and collaborative parties, are using systems that are year 2000 compliant or will address any year 2000 issues in a timely fashion. Any year 2000 compliance problems of either the Company, its suppliers, its clinical research organizations, or its collaborative partners could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial conditions.   Certain Business Risks    The Company is currently in the early stage of product development. NPS 1506 and compounds for the treatment of HPT are the only product candidates under development by the Company or its licensees that are in human clinical trials. There is no guarantee that NPS 1506 or any compound for HPT will prove to be safe or effective or that back-up or later generation compounds will be identified or taken into clinical trials or if so identified and so tested, that such compounds will be found to be safe, effective or marketable. All of the Company's remaining technologies are in preclinical stages and will require significant additional research and development efforts prior to any commercial use. Because the Company has granted exclusive development, commercialization and marketing rights in the fields of HPT and osteoporosis, the success of its existing HPT and osteoporosis programs is primarily dependent upon the efforts of Amgen, Kirin and SmithKline Beecham.    Other risks include the Company's lack of product sales, a history of operating losses, the uncertainty of regulatory approvals, rapid technological change and competition, the uncertainty of protection of the Company's patents and proprietary technology, the Company's dependence on third parties for manufacturing, the Company's future capital needs and the uncertainty of additional funding, the Company's lack of marketing capabilities, the uncertainty of third-party reimbursement, the uncertainty of the Company's in- licensing efforts, the Company's dependence on key personnel and the Company's ability to manage growth. A more detailed                                        29   discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements is contained in Item 1, "Business -- Risk Factors."
