ITEM 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and      Results of Operations.       The following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.  Overview       Substantially all of our resources are devoted to our research and development programs. To date, we have not completed development of any pharmaceutical product for sale. We have incurred cumulative losses through December 31, 1998 of $43.3 million, net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of $52.1 million. We expect to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue to expand our research and development activities and our preclinical and clinical testing activities. Substantially all revenues are derived from license fees, milestone payments, and research and development support payments from licensees and these revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, we expect that income or loss will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, that the fluctuations may be substantial, and that results from prior quarters may not be indicative of future operating results. Profitability will depend in part on our ability and the ability of our licensees, to complete product development, to obtain the required regulatory approvals, and to manufacture and market products. We cannot assure that these events will occur.  Results of Operations       Most of our revenues of $3.6 million in 1998, $5.8 million in 1997, and $20.3 million in 1996, were derived from research and license agreements. We recognized revenue from these agreements as follows:       .    Under our agreement with SmithKline Beecham we recognized $2.2 million           in 1998, $1.9 million in 1997, and $5.7 million in 1996;       .    Under our agreement with Kirin we recognized $1.0 million in 1998,           $3.5 million in 1997, and $4.0 million in 1996; and       .    Under our agreement with Amgen we recognized $400,000 in 1998 and           1997, and $10.6 million in 1996.       These revenues were derived from a combination of one-time license fees, milestone payments and research and development support payments and are not indicative of future revenue that may be earned under these agreements. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for further discussion of payments that may be received in the future under these agreements.       Research and development expenses increased to $17.9 million in 1998, from $15.1 million in 1997, and $11.3 million in 1996. The increases in research and development expenses were principally due to commencement of clinical trials for NPS 1506 in mid-1997 and the commencement of clinical trials for NPS 1776 in mid-1998. We expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future if we conduct increasingly expensive later-stage clinical trials and if we start clinical trials for new product candidates.       General and administrative expenses increased over the three years with expenses of $5.5 million in 1998, $5.6 million in 1997, and $5.1 million in 1996. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase modestly in the future as necessary to support research and development activities.       Interest income and gain on the sale of marketable investment securities were $2.7 million in 1998, $3.4 million in 1997, and $2.7 million in 1996. The increase in 1997 was primarily due to a higher average cash balance resulting from the net proceeds of the follow-on offering of NPS common stock in May 1996. We anticipate that interest income will decrease in the future as cash is utilized for operations.                                         24        Income tax expense of $168,000 in 1997 and $350,000 in 1996 resulted from a 10% Japanese tax withheld on the license fee and milestone payments by Kirin, and from United States alternative minimum tax of $118,000 incurred on net income in 1996 and paid in 1997. Any future milestone and royalty payments from Kirin will be subject to the same 10% tax.       As of December 31, 1998, we had a federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately $39.5 million and a federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately $3.1 million. Our ability to utilize these operating loss and research credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the "change in ownership rules" under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. See Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       We have financed operations since inception primarily through collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public placement of equity securities. As of December 31, 1998, we had recognized $52.1 million of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements and $88.3 million in consideration for the sale of equity securities for cash and services. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investment securities which totaled $43.4 million at December 31, 1998.       We receive quarterly research and/or development support payments under our agreements with Amgen, Kirin, and SmithKline Beecham. The payments are scheduled to aggregate $5.5 million through the scheduled expiration dates of the agreements, respectively, in December, June, and October 2000. In addition, SmithKline Beecham will purchase 249,000 shares of NPS common stock on November 1, 1999, at a premium to the market price, if the research agreement is not terminated early.       We could receive future payments of up to $49.0 million in the aggregate from Amgen, Kirin, and SmithKline Beecham upon the accomplishment of specified research and/or development milestones under the respective agreements. However, we do not control the subject matter, timing, or resources applied by our licensees under their respective development programs. Thus, potential receipt of milestone payments from these licensees is largely beyond our control. Progress under these agreements is subject to risk and each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee. We cannot assure that our licensees will make any future payments, whether as research or development milestone payments or support payments.       We have entered into sponsored research and license agreements that obligate us to make research support payments to academic and/or commercial research institutions. Additional payments may be required upon the accomplishment of research milestones by the institutions, or as license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses. As of December 31, 1998, we had a total commitment of approximately $2.1 million for future research support payments. We expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future.       As of December 31, 1998, our investment in leasehold improvements, equipment, and furnishings was $4.4 million, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Additional equipment and facilities may be needed if we increase our internal research and development activities, a portion of which may be financed with debt or leases.       We expect that our existing capital resources, including interest earned thereon, and expected research and development support payments and equity purchases from licensees, will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least 24 months. However, actual needs are dependent on numerous factors, including our progress toward developing and commercializing products. Furthermore, in the event we in-license or otherwise acquire a product candidate, substantial expenditures for developing and commercializing the product candidate would be required. In addition, if any licensee terminates its agreement, we might not have sufficient capital to complete the development and commercialization of a product in the respective territory. A reduction in the expected amount of research and development support payments or equity purchases may shorten the period during which we could maintain our operations or require us to reduce operations.       It may also become necessary to raise additional funds to support our development and commercialization programs. We are presently seeking additional funding for certain current programs through corporate                                          25   collaborations and licensing agreements. We may also seek additional funding through public or private financing which could be dilutive to current shareholders. We cannot assure that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may modify plans for some of our research and development programs.  Year 2000 Assessment       We continue to assess impact of the year 2000 on our operations and systems. We have developed assessment procedures and a plan to address identified issues. A Y2K Task Force was assembled in the beginning of 1998 to evaluate the potential impact of the so called "Year 2000 millennium bug" on our operations. Since formation, the task force has monitored the evaluation of financial, accounting, information managements, scientific equipment, and building systems. To date financial, accounting, and information management systems review has been completed. Those systems which were not compliant have been replaced. We continue to assess the impact of the year 2000 on our other systems and equipment. We expect to have identified and replaced or updated all internal systems and equipment which are not year 2000 compliant before the year 2000 to the extent necessary to enable us to continue operations. We do not expect the cost of repair or replacement to be material to our operations. We are also seeking assurance from primary third-party service and goods suppliers, including financial institutions, suppliers, CROs and other collaborative parties that they do not expect the year 2000 matter to materially impact their dealings with us. To date, we are not aware of any critical third-party suppliers that will not be able to meet our needs in order to maintain operations. We cannot assure that these third parties are using systems that are year 2000 compliant or will address any year 2000 issues in a timely fashion. Any year 2000 compliance problems of our suppliers, clinical research organizations, or our licensees could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  Certain Business Risks       We are currently in the early stage of product development. NPS 1506, NPS 1776, and compounds for the treatment of HPT are the only product candidates in clinical development by us or our licensees. There is no guarantee that NPS 1506, NPS 1776, or any compound for HPT will prove to be safe or effective or that back-up or later generation compounds will be identified or taken into clinical trials or if so identified and so tested, that the compounds will be found to be safe, effective, or marketable. All of our remaining technologies are in preclinical stages and will require significant additional research and development efforts before any commercial use. Because we have granted exclusive development, commercialization, and marketing rights in the fields of HPT and osteoporosis, the success of these programs is primarily dependent upon the efforts of Amgen, Kirin, and SmithKline Beecham.       Other business risks include our lack of product sales, a history of operating losses, the uncertainty of regulatory approvals, rapid technological change and competition, the uncertainty of protection of our patents and proprietary technology, our dependence on third parties for manufacturing, future capital needs and the uncertainty of additional funding, our lack of marketing capabilities, the uncertainty of third-party reimbursement, the uncertainty of in-licensing efforts, our dependence on key personnel and our ability to manage growth. A more detailed discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements is contained in Item 1, "Business -- Risk Factors."  ITEM 8.
