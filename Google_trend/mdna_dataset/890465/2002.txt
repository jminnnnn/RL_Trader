ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results         of Operations.       You should read this discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.  Overview       Our objective is to build a profitable biopharmaceutical company by discovering, developing and commercializing small molecule drugs and recombinant proteins. Our product candidates are primarily for the treatment of bone and mineral disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and central nervous system disorders. We have product drug candidates in active clinical development and several preclinical product candidates. We have incurred cumulative losses from inception through December 31, 2001 of approximately $161.0 million, net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of approximately $73.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue our current and anticipated development projects, particularly our clinical trial programs for PREOS and ALX-0600, as we maintain our contractual commitment to fund research activities in our metabolic glutamate receptor program, and as we develop internal marketing and sales capabilities and manufacturing relationships.       On December 23, 1999 we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Allelix Biopharmaceuticals Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in Ontario, Canada for 6,516,923 shares of our common stock and assumed options and warrants for the issuance of an additional 675,520 shares of our common stock. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with an effective date of December 31, 1999. Accordingly, operating results of Allelix are only included in our consolidated statements of operations for periods after that date. We did, however, record an expense of $17.8 million in 1999 for in-process research and development that we acquired as part of our purchase of Allelix.  Results of Operations       Revenues. Substantially all of our revenues have come from license fees and research and development support or milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators. These revenues fluctuate from year to year. Our revenues were $10.4 million in 2001, $7.6 million in 2000, and $3.4 million in 1999. The increase in revenues from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to the recognition of milestone payments from our licensees Amgen Inc., Kirin Brewery Company, Ltd., Forest Laboratories, Inc., and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. The increases in revenues in 2000 from 1999 were primarily due to revenues from license agreements we acquired as a result of our purchase of Allelix. We recognized revenue from our agreements as follows:       .    under our agreement with GlaxoSmithKline we recognized $750,000 in           2001, $1.8 million in 2000, and $2.0 million in 1999;      .    under our agreement with Kirin, we recognized $3.0 million in 2001 and           $1.0 million in each of 2000 and 1999;      .    under our agreement with Amgen we recognized $3.0 million in 2001 and           $400,000 in each of 2000 and 1999;      .    under our agreement with Forest, we recognized $1.0 million in 2001,           $200,000 in 2000 and nothing in 1999;      .    under our agreement with Lilly Canada, we recognized $1.7 million in           2000, and nothing in each of 2001 and 1999;      .    under our agreement with Janssen, we recognized $1.0 million in 2001,           $1.9 million in 2000, and nothing in 1999; and      .    under our research funding agreement with the Government of Canada, we           recognized $1.3 million in 2001, $404,000 in 2000 and nothing in 1999.       Research and Development Expenses. Our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and other related costs of our personnel who are dedicated to research and development activities and from the fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside professionals to conduct research, clinical studies and trials, and for manufacturing of drug compounds and related supplies prior to FDA approval. Our research and development expenses increased to $60.1 million in 2001 from $27.9 million in 2000 and $16.9 million in 1999. Research and development expenses increased from 2000 to 2001 principally due to an increase in the number of patients participating in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial for PREOS, the increased manufacturing of PREOS, and the ongoing pilot Phase II study with ALX-0600 in patients with short bowel syndrome. The increase from 1999 to 2000 was principally due to the commencement of the Phase III clinical trial for PREOS and the pilot Phase II clinical trial for ALX-0600.       General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our management and administrative staff, business insurance, taxes, professional fees, and market research and promotion activities for our product candidates. Our general and administrative expenses increased to $12.1 million in 2001 from $12.0 million in 2000 and $6.0 million in 1999. The increase from 1999 to 2000 was primarily the result of increased costs of our operations, including our acquisition of Allelix in December 1999, and a charge of $990,000 for compensation expense for stock options held by management that vested on the signing of a license agreement in 2000.                                         26        Amortization of Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles. We are required to amortize goodwill and other acquired intangibles as a result of our acquisition of Allelix in December 1999. The remaining intangible assets at December 31, 2001 totaled approximately $10.8 million. We are amortizing these assets over their expected lives, which range from two to six years at the time of acquisition. We recorded amortization expense of $3.4 million in 2001 compared to $3.6 million in 2000. We did not record any amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles in 1999 since the effective date of the Allelix acquisition for accounting purposes was December 31, 1999. Beginning January 1, 2002, we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of $6.8 million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of $3.9 million, all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) Nos. 141 and 142.       In-Process Research and Development Acquired. We recorded an expense of $17.8 million in 1999 for in-process research and development that we acquired as part of our purchase of Allelix. The acquired in-process research and development consisted of five drug development programs, of which PREOS, for osteoporosis, and ALX-0600, for gastrointestinal disorders, accounted for 83 percent of the total value.       Since the date of the acquisition, we revised our plans for the next series of clinical trials for PREOS and ALX-0600. We started a pivotal Phase III clinical trial with PREOS. We also started enrolling a small number of patients in a pilot Phase II clinical trial with ALX-0600. Since the date of acquisition and through December 31, 2001, we have incurred development costs of approximately $55.1 million for PREOS and $4.8 million for ALX-0600. Total development costs and time-to-completion for each of these product candidates will depend on the costs we incur to conduct current clinical trials and to perform any additional work we find necessary to obtain FDA approval.       We believe the assumptions we used in the valuation of the in-process research and development we acquired from Allelix were reasonable at the time of the acquisition. However, we have modified our development plans, as new data have become available regarding each product candidate. Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results in the valuation.       Total Other Income, Net. Our total other income, net, increased to $15.5 million in 2001 from $4.3 million in 2000 and $1.6 million in 1999. The increase from 2000 to 2001 and from 1999 to 2000 was mainly the result of increased interest income of $7.2 million in 2001 and $3.0 million in 2000. The increase in interest income is the result of higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. These balances increased primarily due to proceeds we received from the private placement offering of 3.9 million shares of our common stock which was closed in April 2000 and from a public offering of 4.6 million shares of our common stock which was completed in November 2000. In addition, the gain on sale of marketable investment securities increased by $1.5 million in 2001 and by $300,000 in 2000 due to a decreasing interest rate environment resulting in larger realized gains on marketable investment securities. Finally, during 2001, we recognized income of $1.7 million from an equity-method investment.       In 2000, we recognized $1.1 million loss on disposition of equipment, leasehold improvements, and leases. The loss on disposition of equipment, leasehold improvements, and leases in 2000 is primarily due to a loss of approximately $1.2 million associated with closing a facility in New Jersey following the acquisition of Allelix. We anticipated at the time of the acquisition that we would sublease the facility for the remaining nine-year term of our lease obligation and retain the existing leasehold improvements. However, we were able to negotiate a release of our obligation from the landlord subject to our forfeiting the leasehold improvements and certain office furniture and equipment which had a net book value of approximately $1.2 million.  Taxes       As of December 31, 2001, we had a United States federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately $77.1 million and a United States federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately $5.2 million. We also had a Canadian federal and provincial income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately $6.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, a Canadian research pool carryforward of approximately $132.7 million and a Canadian investment tax credit carryforward of approximately $13.6 million. Our ability to utilize the United States operating loss and credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the "change in ownership rules" under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Cumulative Effect on Prior Years (to December 31, 1999) of Changing to a Different Revenue Recognition Method.       During the fourth quarter of 2000, we adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No 101, Revenue Recognition (SAB No. 101). SAB No. 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. Under our previous accounting policy, revenues from nonrefundable licensing fees were recognized when received when we had no further obligations relative to such licensing fees. In compliance with SAB No. 101, we now recognize revenues from nonrefundable licensing fees over the continuing involvement period with each licensee. The adoption of SAB No. 101 resulted in an increase in operating income of                                         27   $500,000 and no change in the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2000. Prior-year financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting principle.  Future Outlook       We estimate that revenues in the first quarter of 2002 will be approximately $500,000 from existing research and development funding and license agreements. In January 2002, Forest notified us that we had earned a $2.0 million milestone payment as a result of the achievement of certain preclinical and clinical developments. Forest approved issuance of a press release by us announcing that event. In March 2002, we received notice from Forest that it was terminating the agreement and returning all rights to ALX-0646 to us. Forest also indicated that it believes this obviates its obligation to pay the $2.0 million milestone payment. We disagree with this assertion and are evaluating arbitration as provided under the agreement. Nevertheless, we will not recognize revenue for the $2.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter. We expect that research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2002 will be between $20.0 and $24.0 million and general and administrative expenses will be between $3.5 and $4.0 million. We expect amortization of purchased intangibles to be approximately $325,000 and other income, net, to be between $1.9 million and $2.3 million.       On a per quarter basis during 2002, we anticipate that research and development expenses will fluctuate between $20.0 and $25.0 million as we conduct current and planned clinical studies for PREOS and anticipated clinical trials for ALX-0600 and as we increase our pre-launch manufacturing and market development costs for these product candidates. Quarter to quarter fluctuations may be significant for both revenues and expenses, but we anticipate that our operations will use between $90.0 and $100.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities in 2002. This guidance reflects the substantial increase in our enrollment in the TOP clinical trial for osteoporosis over earlier expected targets, the planned pace and scope of the TOP and other clinical trials and planned manufacturing arrangements for PREOS. Any changes to current plans for clinical trials or manufacturing could have an impact on cash expenditures in 2002.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       We have financed operations since inception primarily through collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public issuance and sale of equity securities. As of December 31, 2001, we had recognized $73.5 million of cumulative revenues from payments for research support, license fees and milestone payments and $329.0 million from the sale of equity securities for cash. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investment securities, which totaled $207.5 million at December 31, 2001. The primary objectives for the company's marketable investment security portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return to the Company, consistent with these two objectives. The Company's investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer.       We could receive future milestone payments of up to $92.5 million in the aggregate if each of our current licensees accomplishes the specified research and/or development milestones provided in the respective agreements. In addition, all of the agreements require the licensees to make royalty payments to us if they sell products covered by the terms of our license agreements. However, we do not control the subject matter, timing or resources applied by our licensees to their development programs. Thus, potential receipt of milestone and royalty payments from these licensees is largely beyond our control. Some of the late-stage development milestone payments from AstraZeneca will not be due if we elect a co-promotion option under which we may commercialize products. Further, each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee either for any reason or under certain conditions.       Prior to the time that we acquired Allelix in December 1999, Allelix had entered into a research funding agreement with the Government of Canada pursuant to the Technology Partnership Canada program. Under this agreement, Canada is obligated to reimburse us for up to 30 percent of eligible research and development costs we incur for our ALX-0600 product candidate through December 2002 up to a maximum of Cdn. $8.4 million. As of December 31, 2001, we had invoiced Canada for a total of Cdn. $4.7 million for reimbursement. The agreement provides Canada with a 10 percent royalty on revenues we receive from the sale or license of ALX-0600. Our royalty obligation terminates on December 31, 2008 if we have paid at least Cdn. $23.9 million. If we have not paid that amount by that date, our royalty obligation continues until the earlier of the date we have paid Cdn. $23.9 million or December 31, 2017. The agreement contains a number of significant limitations on our ability to develop and commercialize ALX-0600 outside of Canada.       We have entered into sponsored research, license, and purchase agreements that obligate us to make research support and milestone payments to academic or commercial research institutions and individuals. As of December 31, 2001, we have a total commitment of up to $1.8 million for future research support and milestone payments. Further, depending on the commercial success of certain of our products, we may be required to pay license fees or royalties. We expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future.                                         28        Under our agreement with AstraZeneca, we are required to co-direct the research and pay for an equal share of the research costs, including personnel and capital, through at least September 2003 and, under certain circumstances, through March 2006. Additionally, as of December 31, 2001, we have a non- cancelable commitment for future manufacturing of PREOS of approximately $17.6 million over a four-year period commencing in June 2001. We expect to enter into additional collaborative research agreements and manufacturing agreements in the future, which may require long-term commitments of cash.       We expect that our existing capital resources including interest earned thereon, will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our current and planned operations through at least 2003. However, our actual needs will depend on numerous factors, especially with regard to the clinical trial programs and pre-launch market development and production costs for PREOS and ALX-0600. If we advance current proprietary programs; if we in-license or otherwise acquire other technologies, product candidates or companies; or if current clinical trials are accelerated, delayed or terminated for any reason, we may need to make substantial additional expenditures or we may need to substantially reduce planned expenditures. Our clinical trials may be accelerated, delayed, or terminated for several reasons including the risk that our product candidates will demonstrate safety concerns, the risk that regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates for further development or may require additional or expanded clinical trials to be performed, and the risk that contract manufacturers may not be able to supply sufficient quantities of our drug candidates to support our clinical trials, which could lead to a cessation of the clinical trials. We do not have on hand sufficient supplies of our product candidates to meet our clinical trial requirements and we are dependent on outside contract manufacturers to provide these supplies on a timely basis. If any of the events that pose these risks comes to fruition, we may have to substantially curtail or postpone current and planned clinical trials, our business may be materially harmed, our stock price may be adversely affected, and our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired.       We need to raise substantial additional funds to support our long-term research, product development, and commercialization programs. To provide for financial flexibility and increased liquidity, the Company filed a shelf registration statement in January 2002. Under the shelf registration statement, the Company may offer up to $250.0 million of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, and/or warrants, with terms to be determined by market conditions. We may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances, collaborations, or license agreements and other financing mechanisms. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs, or to obtain funds through arrangements with licensees or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates that we may otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own.  Critical Accounting Policies       Our  critical accounting policies are as follows:            .    revenue recognition;           .    accounting for income taxes; and           .    valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill.       Revenue Recognition. We earn our revenue from research and development support payments, license fees, and milestone payments. As described below, significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.       We apply the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition (SAB No. 101), to all of our revenue transactions. We recognize revenue from our research and development support agreements as related research and development costs are incurred and from milestone payments as agreed upon events representing the achievement of substantive steps in the development process are achieved and where the amount of the milestone payment, approximates the value of achieving the milestone. We recognize nonrefundable license fees over the period we have continuing involvement. Cash received in advance of the performance of the related research and development support and for nonrefundable license fees when we have continuing involvement is recorded as deferred revenue.       Accounting for Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation expense for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations.                                         29        Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $97.3 million as of December 31, 2001, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits, before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to reduce our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.       Valuation of Long-lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill. We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:            .    significant underperformance relative to expected historical or                projected future operating results;           .    significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired                assets or the strategy for our overall business;           .    significant negative industry or economic trends;           .    significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period;                and           .    our market capitalization relative to net book value.       When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets, and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Net intangible assets, long-lived assets, and goodwill amounted to $15.6 million as of December 31, 2001.       In 2002, SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, became effective and as a result, we will cease to amortize goodwill. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter. We expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of 2002. Beginning January 1, 2002, we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of $6.8 million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of $3.9 million, all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142. Amortization expense related to goodwill and the assembled work force component of identifiable intangible assets was $1.8 million and $319,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001. The assembled workforce component of identifiable intangible assets was fully amortized as of December 31, 2001. We currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review. However, there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements       In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interests method of accounting and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and is applicable to all purchase method business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 141 also specifies that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet certain criteria to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill, noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately. SFAS No. 142 will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized effective January 1, 2002; rather, these assets must be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.       Beginning January 1, 2002, we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of $6.8 million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of $3.9 million, all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142. Amortization expense related to goodwill and the assembled work force component of identifiable intangible assets was $1.8 million and $319,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. The assembled workforce component of identifiable intangible assets was fully amortized as of December 31, 2001. We expect to complete our impairment review of goodwill during the first quarter of 2002 and do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review. However, there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed, a material impairment charge may not be recorded.       In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the asset.                                         30        We are required and plan to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 143 for the quarter ending March 31, 2003. To accomplish this, we must identify legal obligations for asset retirement obligations, if any, and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption. Because of the effort necessary to comply with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, it is not practicable for management to estimate the impact of adopting this Statement as of the date of this report on Form 10-K.       In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which supersedes both SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations--Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS No. 144 retains the fundamental provisions in SFAS No. 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with SFAS No. 121. SFAS No. 144 retains the basic provisions of APB Opinion 30 on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business.       We are required and we plan to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 144 for the quarter ending March 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 for long-lived assets held for use to have a material impact our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144 is largely unchanged from SFAS No. 121. The provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities. We cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of SFAS No. 144 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       Interest Rate Risk. Our primary objectives in managing our investment portfolio are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields. The securities we hold in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk. At any time, sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings. After a review of our marketable investment securities, we believe that in the event of a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates, the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements. Currently, we do not hedge these interest rate exposures. We have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. We place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers, types and maturities, which consist mainly of highly liquid, investment-grade securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component in stockholders' equity.       Foreign Currency Risk. Some of our research and development operations are in Canada. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as a change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Canadian dollar, or by weak economic conditions in Canada. When the United States dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar, the cost of expenses in Canada decreases. When the United States dollar weakens against the Canadian dollar, the cost of expenses in Canada increases. The monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiary that are impacted by the foreign currency fluctuations are cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. A hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Canadian dollar from the December 31, 2001 rate would cause the fair value of such monetary assets and liabilities in Canada to change by an insignificant amount. We are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities.  ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
