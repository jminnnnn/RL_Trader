ITEM 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and           Results of Operations.       The following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.  Overview       Substantially all of our resources are devoted to our research and development programs. To date, we have not completed development of any pharmaceutical product for sale. We have incurred cumulative losses through December 31, 1999 of $78.9 million, net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of $55.5 million. We expect to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue to expand our research and development activities and our testing activities in the laboratory, in animals and in humans. Substantially all our revenues come from license fees, milestone payments, and research and development support payments from licensees; these revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, we expect that income or loss will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, that the fluctuations may be substantial, and that results from prior quarters may not be indicative of future operating results. Profitability will depend in part on our ability and the ability of our licensees, to complete product development, to obtain the required regulatory approvals, and to manufacture and market products. We cannot assure that these events will occur.  Results of Operations       All of our revenues of $3.4 million in 1999, $3.6 million in 1998, and $5.8 million in 1997, were derived from research and license agreements. We recognized revenue from these agreements as follows:       1.   Under our agreement with SmithKline Beecham we recognized $2.0 million           in 1999, $2.2 million in 1998, and $1.9 million in 1997;       2.   Under our agreement with Kirin we recognized $1.0 million in each of           1999 and 1998 and $3.5 million in 1997; and       3.   Under our agreement with Amgen we recognized $400,000 in each of 1999,           1998 and 1997.       The higher revenue in 1997 resulted from a one-time milestone payment of $2.0 million from Kirin. These historical amounts are not indicative of future revenue that we may earn under these agreements. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for further discussion of payments that we may earn in the future under these agreements.       Research and development expenses decreased to $16.9 million in 1999 from $17.9 million in 1998 after an increase from $15.1 million in 1997. The increase in research and development expenses from 1997 to 1998 was principally due to the commencement of Phase I clinical trials for NPS 1776 in the third quarter of 1998. The decrease in research and development expenses from 1998 to 1999 was principally due to the completion of the clinical trials for NPS 1776 in mid- 1999. We expect development expenses to increase dramatically in 2000 as we conduct Phase III clinical trials for ALX1-11and Phase II clinical trials for ALX-0600. We may incur additional research and development expenses if we start other clinical trials or if we acquire new technologies, product candidates or companies.       General and administrative expenses were $6.0 million in 1999, $5.5 million in 1998, and $5.6 million in 1997. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future in order to support operations in Canada and the U.S. and pre-launch marketing costs incurred for product candidates.       We recorded a one-time expense of $17.76 million in 1999 for in-process research and development acquired as part of the purchase of Allelix. We used an independent valuation of Allelix to value the acquired in-process research and development projects. We assigned a fair value to purchased in-process research and development by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in-process research and development into commercially viable products and discounting the resulting net cash flows related to these projects. At the date of the acquisition, the acquired in-process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility (FDA approval) and had no alternative future uses.                                         27        In developing these cash flow projections, we forecasted revenues for each project based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by Allelix and its competitors. The projected revenues are dependent upon successful introduction of products from the in-process research and development projects.       In determining the operating cash flows related exclusively to each in- process research and development project, we considered the contribution of both developed technology and core technology leveraged by the in-process project. Because Allelix did not have any products that had achieved technological feasibility as of the valuation date, we assigned no value to developed technology for allocation purposes. The value of the core technology leveraged by the in-process projects was captured in the valuation of the patent portfolio, consequently, we assigned no value for allocation purposes to core technology leveraged by the in-process projects.       Considering both project costs and technological progress for each project, we employed percentage of completion assumptions to reduce the projected revenue streams for the incomplete portion of each project as of the valuation date. We forecasted operating expenses and resulting profit margins were based on the characteristics and cash flow generating potential of the acquired in-process research and development. We applied a tax rate of 40 percent and appropriate adjustments were made to operating income to derive net cash flow for each project.       The revenues earned by the in-process research and development products represent the return on all of the assets acquired under the agreement. The cash flows generated by the new products must provide a return on each asset purchased that is consistent with the value and the relative risk of the asset. To separately value in-process research and development, we determined the value and required rate of return for other identifiable assets. We deducted the required return on these other contributory assets from the cash flows generated by the projects in the in-process research and development model to determine the incremental net cash flows specifically attributable to the completed portion of the in-process research and development projects.       The discount rate applied to the net estimated cash flow for each in- process research and development project was based on each project's state of development, complexity, and the market risk for the resulting product. We applied discount rates of 45 to 75 percent to the in-process research and development projects.       We valued the remaining intangible assets acquired from Allelix at $19.0 million after the write-off of in-process research and development. This amount includes goodwill, assembled work force, and patents which are being amortized using the straight-line basis over lives ranging from two to six years. We did not incur any amortization of acquired intangibles in 1999.       Interest income was $1.8 million in 1999, $2.4 million in 1998, and $3.3 million in 1997. The decreases in 1998 and 1999 were primarily due to decreases in the average balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investment securities as cash was utilized for operations. On February 3, 2000, we signed definitive agreements for the private placement of 3.9 million shares of our common stock with expected net proceeds to us of approximately $43.5 million upon closing of the transaction. We expect that interest income will be higher in 2000 due to a higher average cash balance resulting from this offering. However, we anticipate that interest income will decrease in the future as cash is utilized for operations.       As of December 31, 1999, we had a U.S. federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately $64.4 million and a U.S. federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately $4.1 million. We also had a Canadian federal income tax investment credit carryforward of approximately $4.2 million, and a Canadian federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately $31.5 million and a Canadian net operating loss carryforward of approximately $2.7 million. Our ability to utilize the U.S. operating loss and credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the "change in ownership rules" under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.                                         28   Liquidity and Capital Resources       We have financed operations since inception primarily through collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public placement of equity securities. As of December 31, 1999, we had recognized $55.5 million of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements and $89.4 million in consideration for the sale of equity securities for cash and services. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investment securities which totaled $35.7 million at December 31, 1999. In addition, the net proceeds of the private placement agreements signed in February 2000 are expected to provide approximately $43.5 million in cash to us.       We receive quarterly research and/or development support payments under our agreements with Amgen, Kirin, and SmithKline Beecham and from Janssen and Eli Lilly Canada under agreements acquired as part of the Allelix transaction. All of the research and/or development support payments under these agreements are scheduled to expire in 2000. We do not receive any research and development support payments under our agreement with Abbott Laboratories. We could receive future payments of up to $88.0 million in the aggregate upon the accomplishment of specified research and/or development milestones under the several agreements. All of the agreements provide for future royalties to be paid to us from the sale of products derived from these license agreements. However, we do not control the subject matter, timing, or resources applied by our licensees under the several development programs. Thus, potential receipt of milestone payments and royalties from these licensees is largely beyond our control. Progress under these agreements is subject to risk and each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee. We cannot assure that our licensees will make any future payments, whether as research or development support payments, milestone payments or royalty payments.       We have an agreement with Technology Partnerships Canada (TPC), a program of the Canadian government, which provides for TPC to reimburse us for research expenses incurred pursuing treatments for various intestinal disorders utilizing specified technology (the ALX-0600 technology). TPC is bound to reimburse us for 30% of the qualified costs incurred through December 2002 up to a maximum of Cdn $8.4 million. We will pay a 10% royalty to TPC on revenues received by us through December 2008, from the sale or license of any product developed from the funded research. If such payments have not reached a total of Cdn $23.9 million by that date, then royalty payments shall continue until that amount is reached or until December 2017, whichever occurs first. If TPC declares an event of default by us under the agreement, we could be required to repay all amounts received from TPC, plus interest and other damages. As of December 31, 1999, no event of default had occurred.       We have entered into joint venture agreements and sponsored research and license agreements that obligate us to purchase services from the joint ventures and to make research support payments to academic and/or commercial research institutions. As of December 31, 1999, we had a total commitment of approximately $1.5 million for future joint venture services and research support payments. Additional payments may be required upon the accomplishment of research milestones by the research institutions, or as license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses. We expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future.       We expect that our existing capital resources, including interest earned thereon, and expected research and development support payments, milestone payments and the proceeds of the private placement agreements signed in February 2000 will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least 24 months. However, actual needs are dependent on numerous factors, especially with regard to the clinical trial and pre-launch marketing and production costs for ALX1-11. Furthermore, in the event we in- license or otherwise acquire other technologies, product candidates or companies, substantial expenditures may be required. In addition, if any licensee terminates its agreement, we might not have sufficient capital to complete the development and commercialization of a product arising from the technology returned to us under the then terminated agreement. A reduction in the expected amount of research and development support payments or milestone payments may shorten the period during which we could maintain our operations or require us to reduce operations, or both.       It may also become necessary to raise additional funds to support our development and commercialization programs. We are presently seeking additional funding for certain current programs through corporate collaborations and licensing agreements. We may also seek additional funding through public or private financing which could be dilutive to current shareholders. We cannot assure that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may modify plans for some of our research and development programs.                                         29   Recent Accounting Pronouncements       The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 in 1999. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings in the period of change. We must adopt SFAS No. 133 in the first quarter of 2001. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No.133 will have a material effect on our financial position or our results of operations.       On December 3, 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101). SAB 101 summarizes certain of the staff's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. We will incorporate the guidance of SAB 101 in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. We have not yet determined the impact that SAB 101 will have on our financial position or results of operations.   ITEM 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       Interest Rate Risk.  Our primary objectives in managing our investment portfolio are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs, and maximize yields. The securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk. We employ established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. We place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers, types, and maturities, which consist mainly of fixed rate financial instruments. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders' equity. At any time, sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings. Currently, we do not hedge these interest rate exposures. After a review of our marketable securities, we believe that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates, the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements.       Foreign Currency Risk.  A portion of our research and development operations are in Canada. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as a change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, or by weak economic conditions in Canada. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian Dollar, the cost of expenses in Canada decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens against the Canadian dollar, the cost of expenses in Canada increases. The monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiary which are impacted by the foreign currency fluctuations are cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and certain accrued liabilities. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar from the December 31, 1999 rate would cause the fair value of such monetary assets and liabilities in Canada to change by an insignificant amount. We are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities.   ITEM 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
