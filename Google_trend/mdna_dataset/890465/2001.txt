ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations.       You should read this discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.  Overview       We discover, develop and intend to commercialize small molecule drugs and recombinant proteins, primarily for bone and mineral disorders and central nervous system disorders. We have five drugs in clinical development and several preclinical product candidates. Our two most advanced product candidates focus on bone and mineral disorders. They are AMG 073, which has completed a series of Phase II clinical trials for treatment of hyperparathyroidism, and ALX1-11, which is in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial for treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis.       On December 23, 1999 we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Allelix, a biopharmaceutical company based in Ontario, Canada for 6,516,923 shares of our common stock and assumed options and warrants for the issuance of an additional 675,520 shares of our common stock. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with an effective date of December 31, 1999. Accordingly, operating results of Allelix are only included in our consolidated statements of operations for periods after that date. We did, however, record an expense of $17.8 million in 1999 for in-process research and development that we acquired as part of our purchase of Allelix.       Substantially all of our resources are devoted to our research and development programs. To date, we have not completed the development of any pharmaceutical product for sale. We have incurred cumulative losses through December 31, 2000 of approximately $111.0 million, net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of approximately $63.1 million. We expect to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue to expand our clinical trials and research activities. In particular, we recently initiated an 1,800 to 2,000 patient Phase III clinical trial for ALX1-11, and expect to expend a significant portion of our resources on the development of this product.  Results of Operations  Revenues       Substantially all our revenues have come from license fees, milestone payments, and research and development support payments from our licensees and collaborators. These revenues fluctuate from year to year. All of the research and development support payments under our existing license or collaborative agreements expired in 2000. Our revenues were $7.6 million in 2000, $3.4 million in 1999, and $3.6 million in 1998. We recognized revenue from our agreements as follows:       .  Under our agreement with GlaxoSmithKline we recognized $1.8 million in         2000, $2.0 million in 1999, and $2.2 million in 1998;      .  Under our agreement with Kirin, we recognized $1.0 million in each of         2000, 1999, and 1998;      .  Under our agreement with Amgen we recognized $400,000 in each of 2000,         1999, and 1998;      .  Under our agreement with Forest, we recognized $200,000 in 2000 and         nothing in each of 1999 and 1998;      .  Under our agreement with Lilly Canada, we recognized $1.7 million in         2000, and nothing in each of 1999 and 1998;      .  Under our agreement with Janssen Parmaceutica, N.V., we recognized $1.9         million in 2000, and nothing in each of 1999 and 1998; and      .  Under our agreement with Technology Partnership Canada, we recognized         $404,000 in 2000 and nothing in each of 1999 and 1998.       The increases in revenues in 2000 were primarily due to revenues from license agreements we acquired as a result of our purchase of Allelix. In addition, we received a $1.0 million one-time milestone payment from GlaxoSmithKline. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for further discussion of payments that we may earn in the future under these agreements.  Operating Expenses       Research and Development Expenses. Our research and development expenses arise primarily from the compensation and other related costs of our personnel who are dedicated to research and development activities and from the fees paid to outside professionals to conduct clinical studies and trials. Our research and development expenses increased to $27.9 million in 2000 from $16.9 million in 1999 after a decrease from $17.9 million in 1998. The decrease in research and development expenses from 1998 to 1999 was principally due to the completion of Phase 1 clinical trials for NPS 1776 in mid-1999. The increase in research and development expenses from 1999 to 2000 is principally due to the commencement of a pivotal Phase III clinical trial for ALX1-11 and                                        21   a pilot Phase II clinical trial from ALX-0600, two product candidates that we acquired as a result of our acquisition of Allelix. We have the right to be reimbursed under our agreement with Technology Partnerships Canada, or TCP, for a portion of our research and development expenses for ALX-0600. We expect research and development expenses to increase as these clinical trials progress and as we begin to manufacture ALX1-11 for market launch. We may incur additional research and development expenses if we start other clinical trials, or if we acquire new technologies, product candidates, or companies.       General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our executive management, finance and administrative staff, business insurance, taxes and professional fees. Our general and administrative expenses increased to $12.0 million in 2000 from $6.0 million in 1999 and $5.5 million in 1998. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased costs of our operations including our recently acquired subsidiary, NPS Allelix, and a charge of $990,000 for compensation expense for stock options held by management that vested on the signing of a license agreement in 2000. We expect that general and administrative expenses in the future will equal or exceed the amount for 2000 in order to support operations in Canada and the U.S. and pre-launch commercialization costs for product candidates.       Amortization of Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles. We are required to amortize goodwill and other acquired intangibles as a result of our December 23, 1999 acquisition of Allelix. The remaining intangible assets at December 31, 2000 total approximately $14.9 million. We are amortizing these assets over their expected lives, which range from two to six years. We recorded amortization expense of $3.6 million in 2000. We did not record any amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles in 1999 and 1998, since the effective date of the Allelix acquisition for accounting purposes was December 31, 1999.       In-Process Research and Development Acquired. We recorded an expense of $17.8 million in 1999 for in-process research and development that we acquired as part of our purchase of Allelix. The acquired in-process research and development consisted of five drug development programs. The two most advanced product candidates, ALX1-11, for osteoporosis, and ALX-0600, for gastrointestinal disorders, accounted for 83% of the total value of the acquired in-process research and development.       We determined the fair value assigned to the in-process research and development by estimating the total costs to develop the product candidates into commercially viable products (i.e., to obtain FDA approval). We then discounted the projected net cash flows related to these product candidates back to their present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. At the date of the acquisition, the product candidates had not yet received FDA approval and had no alternative future uses.       Since the date of the acquisition, we revised our plans for the next series of clinical trials for ALX1-11 and ALX-0600. We started a pivotal Phase III clinical trial with ALX1-11, which we expect will include an 18-month course of treatment in 1,800 to 2,000 patients with osteoporosis. We also started enrolling a small number of patients with short bowel syndrome in a pilot Phase II clinical trial with ALX-0600. Since the date of acquisition and through December 31, 2000, we have incurred development costs of approximately $13.7 million for ALX1-11 and $1.3 million for ALX-0600. Total development costs and time-to-completion for each of these product candidates will depend on the costs we incur to conduct current clinical trials and any additional testing we find necessary to obtain FDA approval.       We believe the assumptions we used in the valuation of the in-process research and development we acquired from Allelix were reasonable at the time of the acquisition. However, we have modified our development plans as new data have become available regarding each product candidate. Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results in the valuation.  Other Income (Expense)       Interest Income. Interest income was $4.8 million in 2000, $1.8 million in 1999, and $2.4 million in 1998. The increase from 1999 to 2000 is the result of higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investment securities. These balances increased primarily due to cash received from a private placement offering of 3.9 million common shares of the Company which was completed in February 2000 and closed in April 2000, and from a follow-on offering of 4.6 million shares of the Company which was completed in November 2000. We expect that interest income will be higher in 2001 due to higher average cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investment security balances for the year resulting from these offerings. However, we anticipate that interest income will decrease in the future as cash is utilized for operations.       Loss on Disposition of Equipment, Leasehold Improvements, and Leases. Loss on the disposition of equipment, leasehold improvements, and leases was $1.1 million in 2000, $131,000 in 1999, and zero in 1998. The increase in the loss from 1999 to 2000 is primarily due to a non-cash loss of approximately $1.2 million in 2000 associated with closing a facility in New Jersey that we acquired as part of the acquisition of Allelix in December 1999. We anticipated at the time of the acquisition that we would sublease the facility for the remaining nine-year term of our lease obligation and retain the existing leasehold improvements. However, we were able to negotiate a release of our obligation from the landlord subject to our forfeiting the leasehold improvements and certain office                                        22   furniture and equipment which had a net book value of approximately $1.2 million. We expect that the loss on disposition of equipment, leasehold improvements, and leases in the future to be immaterial.       Cumulative Effect on Prior Years (to December 31, 1999) of Changing to a Different Revenue Recognition Method. During the fourth quarter of 2000, we adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition (SAB No. 101). SAB No. 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. Under our previous accounting policy, revenues from nonrefundable licensing fees were recognized when received when we had no further obligations relative to such licensing fees. In compliance with SAB No. 101, we now recognize revenues from nonrefundable licensing fees over the continuing involvement period with each licensee. The adoption of SAB No. 101 resulted in an increase in operating income of $500,000 and no change in the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2000. Prior-year financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting principle.       Taxes. As of December 31, 2000 we had a U.S. federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately $77.5 million and a U.S. federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately $4.8 million. We also had a Canadian federal and provincial income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately $7.1 million and $10.9 million, respectively, a Canadian research pool carryforward of approximately $86.0 million and a Canadian investment tax credit carryforward of approximately $3.8 million. Our ability to utilize the U.S. operating loss and credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the "change in ownership rules" under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       We have financed our operations since inception primarily through collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public placement of our equity securities. As of December 31, 2000, we had recognized $63.1 million of cumulative revenues from payments for research support and license fees and $325.7 million from the sale of equity securities for cash. The sale of equity securities includes $7.1 million received from the exercise of options during 2000, $43.3 million, net, from the sale of 3.9 million shares of common stock we closed in April 2000, $180.7 million net, from the sale of 4.6 million shares of common stock we completed in November 2000, $2.0 million from the sale of 168,492 shares of common stock under the terms of an agreement with an existing corporate licensee during May 2000, $136,000 from the sale of common stock under the terms of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and $4.2 million from the exercise of warrants to acquire 264,650 shares of exchangeable shares of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, NPS Allelix Inc. The exchangeable shares may be exchanged into the Company's common shares at any time. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investment securities, which totaled $246.9 million at December 31, 2000.       Net cash used in operating activities was $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $18.1 million and $14.9 million for the years ended 1999 and 1998, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $5.8 million and $900,000 provided by investing activities for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was $235.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $1.8 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2000 was due primarily to the first full year of operations for NPS Allelix Corp., our Canadian subsidiary, which was acquired in late December 1999. The Allelix transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the subsidiary's operations were therefore not included in the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998. Net cash used in investing activities in 2000 was almost entirely the result of investing the proceeds from our private placement, follow-on offering, and option and warrant exercises in marketable investment securities. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2000 resulted primarily from the proceeds from the private placement which closed in April 2000, the follow-on offering which closed in November 2000, and from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants.       During the past, we have received research and/or development support payments under our agreements with Amgen, Kirin, GlaxoSmithKline, and under NPS Allelix's agreements with Janssen and Lilly Canada. With the exception of GlaxoSmithKline, all of the research and development support payments under these agreements expired in 2000. Funded research with GlaxoSmithKline continues on a month-to-month basis. We do not receive any research and development support payments under our agreements with Abbott Laboratories, Forest Laboratories, or AstraZeneca. However, we could receive future payments of up to $142.5 million in the aggregate if we accomplish specified research and/or development milestones under our agreements with all of those parties. Some of the late-stage development milestone payments will not be due from AstraZeneca if we elect a co-promotion option. Each of these agreements also require the licensees to make royalty payments to us if they sell products derived from the license rights. However, we do not control the subject matter, timing, or resources applied by our licensees to their development programs. Thus, potential receipt of milestone payments from these licensees is largely beyond our control. Each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee under certain conditions.       We have an agreement with Technology Partnerships Canada, or TPC, a Canadian government program, under which TPC will reimburse us for our research expenses for treatments for various intestinal disorders using our ALX-0600 product. TPC will                                        23   reimburse us for 30% of the qualified costs we incur through December 2002, to a maximum of Cdn. $8.4 million. We will pay a 10% royalty to TPC on revenues received from the sale or license of any product we develop from the funded research. Those payments terminate in December 2008 if we have paid TPC a total of at least Cdn. $23.9 million through that date, or if we have paid TPC less than that amount through that date, the payments continue until the earlier of when we have paid TPC a total of Cdn. $23.9 million or December 2017. As of December 31, 2000, we have invoiced TPC for a total of Cdn. $2.7 million for reimbursement.       We have entered into sponsored research and license agreements that obligate us to make research support payments to academic and/or commercial research institutions. We may be required to make additional payments if the research institutions reach milestones, or for license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses. We expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future.       We expect that our existing capital resources, including interest earned thereon, will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next 24 months. However, our actual needs will depend on numerous factors, especially with regard to the clinical trials and pre-launch marketing and production costs for ALX1-11. Furthermore, if we advance current propriety programs or if we in-license or otherwise acquire other technologies, product candidates or companies, we may need to make substantial additional expenditures.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements       The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in 1998. SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS Nos. 137 and 138, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings in the period of change. Because we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities, our adoption of SFAS No. 133, on January 1, 2001, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  ITEM 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.        Interest Rate Risk. Our primary objectives in managing our investment portfolio are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs, and maximize yields. The securities we hold in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk. We have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. We place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers, types, and maturities, which consist mainly of fixed rate financial instruments. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders' equity. At any time, sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings. Currently, we do not hedge these interest rate exposures. After a review of our marketable securities, we believe that in the event of a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates, the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements.       Foreign Currency Risk. Some of our research and development operations are in Canada. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as a change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, or by weak economic conditions in Canada. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian Dollar, the cost of expenses in Canada decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens against the Canadian dollar, the cost of expenses in Canada increases. The monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiary which are impacted by the foreign currency fluctuations are cash, marketable investment securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and certain accrued liabilities. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar from the December 31, 2000 rate would cause the fair value of such monetary assets and liabilities in Canada to change by an insignificant amount. We are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities, although we may engage in those types of activities in the future.  ITEM 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
