ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION   Overview        Currently,  we  develop  and  market  healthcare  communication  technology products.  Our  technologies  are  designed to provide  connectivity  of medical related information between POCs and HVCIs. Our products are designed to improve the accuracy and the efficiency of the processes of prescribing  medications and the ordering of laboratory tests and the receiving of laboratory results.       Our  current  financial  condition  is a direct  result of the  efforts  to develop a commercially viable healthcare connectivity business.  Critical Accounting Policies        We  have  identified  the  policies  below  as  critical  to  our  business operations and the  understanding  of our results of operations.  The impact and any  associated  risks related to these  policies on our business  operations is discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  where such policies  affect our reported and expected financial results.       In the ordinary course of business,  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions  relating to the  reporting of results of  operations  and financial condition in the  preparation  of our financial  statements  in conformity  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results  could  differ   significantly  from  those  estimates  under  different assumptions and conditions.  We believe that the following  discussion addresses our most critical accounting  policies,  which are those that are most important to the  portrayal  of our  financial  condition  and results of  operations  and require our most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make  estimates  about the effect of matters that are  inherently uncertain.  Revenue Recognition        Our policy is to recognize revenue when the  communication  transaction has been  completed  by  the  customer,  persuasive  evidence  of the  terms  of the arrangement  exist, our fee is fixed and  determinable,  and  collectibility  is reasonably  assured.  Our plan is that delivery  will take place  electronically when the customer has completed the exchange  (transmission  or receipt) of data or as monthly service is provided.  Revenue will be charged to the customer on a per  transaction   basis  as  each   transaction  is  completed  or  as  monthly subscription services are provided and are billed monthly.  Valuation of Goodwill        In accordance with SFAS No. 142 we no longer amortize goodwill,  but rather perform an annual assessment as to whether any impairment has occurred.  We also assess the impairment of goodwill  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances indicate  that the carrying  value may not be  recoverable.  Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following:       o    significant  under-performance  relative  to  expected  historical  or           projected future operating results;      o    significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or           the strategy for our overall business;      o    significant negative industry or economic trends;      o    significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and      o    our market capitalization relative to net book value.       We determine  whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable annually and more frequently based upon events and  circumstances  including the existence of one or more of the above  indicators  of  impairment.  We determine whether  impairment has occurred by first,  comparing the fair value of our only reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying  value of the net assets,  then the second step is to  initially  determine  the fair value of the net assets in the reporting  unit  exclusive of goodwill,  and record any necessary  impairment of assets other than goodwill in accordance  with SFAS No. 144 or other  applicable standards.  The  difference  in the fair  value  of the  individual  net  assets exclusive of goodwill  and the  reporting  unit results in the implied  value of goodwill.  The implied  value of goodwill is compared to its carrying  value and the difference is recorded as an impairment  charge, if necessary.  We performed our annual  evaluation  of  goodwill  and the fair value of the  reporting  unit exceeded its carrying value,  therefore,  no impairment of goodwill existed. Net goodwill amounted to $1.6 million as of December 31, 2002.  Software and Technology Costs        We capitalize  costs,  which primarily  include salaries in connection with developing  software for internal  use. We use judgment in  determining  whether development  costs meet the criteria for  immediate  expense or  capitalization. Direct costs incurred in the  development of software are  capitalized  once the preliminary project stage is completed,  management has committed to funding the project,  and  completion  and use of the software for its intended  purpose are probable.  We cease  capitalization  of development  costs once the software has been  substantially  completed and is ready for its intended use. We capitalized $633,000,  $434,000 and  $495,000 of costs  during the years ended  December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The software  development costs capitalized were  amortized  over the  estimated  useful  life of the  software,  which  was estimated  to be five years.  Amortization  expense was  $216,000,  $156,000 and $134,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.       Included  in  software  costs  are those  costs  associated  with  software research and development  efforts that have not been capitalized under SOP 98-1. Software  research  and  development  costs  totaled  $691,000,  $1,075,000  and $685,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.       Software costs also include the amortization of capitalized  software costs and license fees paid to service providers, which totaled $609,000, $213,000 and $180,000 for the years, ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.       Uncertainties  regarding  future cash flows did not  support  the  carrying value of those costs at December 31, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 144 , the Company wrote-off the remaining  $1,066,000 of previously  capitalized net costs during the forth quarter of 2002.  Future  performance will be enhanced with the acquisition of assets formerly used by  e-Physician,  the merger of the acquired technologies with the Cymedix technologies and the implementation of the revised business strategies.       While the Company's  business model has changed  potentially  affecting the Company's  anticipated near term future operating results,  the Company believes its modified  plan  continues to rely on the same  technology  that was acquired from Cymedix in 1998. Accordingly,  management does not believe an impairment of goodwill has occurred and it continues to have a viable long-term  strategy that is supported by its current market  capitalization  at December 31, 2002,  which supports the fair value of its only reporting unit.  Results of Operation   Comparison of years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001        At present we are not receiving  revenue from the sale of our products.  In 2001, we recognized $29,000 in revenue primarily from the sales of ADC Hardware, a product that we no longer sell.       Software and  technology  costs of  $2,366,000  were  incurred in 2002,  an increase  of  $1,078,000  compared  to  $1,288,000  for 2001.  The  increase  is primarily  related to the write-off of $1,066,000 of previously  capitalized net software  development  costs for which  recoverability  became  uncertain due to uncertainty in future cash flows. The increase also reflects  additional license costs  incurred in 2002 of  $336,000  over 2001 due to added  infrastructure  to support our transaction service  capabilities in 2002 as we placed a major focus on deployment of our  technologies  with PBMs during the first three quarters of 2002.  Amortization of capitalized software development costs increased $60,000, while  research  and  development  costs  decreased by $384,000 due to increased capitalization of costs associated with active projects in 2002.       Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased $166,000 or 3% from $5,746,000 in 2001 to $5,912,000 in 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to $374,000 of leasehold  abandonment  costs incurred in 2002 due to the closure of our  California  and  Georgia  offices,  offset  by a  reduction  in  outside consulting fees.       During 2001, we recorded  impairment  expense of $1,111,000  resulting from the  discontinuance  of our Automated  Design  Concepts  division  which totaled $443,000,  to  focus  staff  resources  on  our  primary  technology,   and  the cancellation  of our  Zirmed  license  totaling  $668,000  which was a result of management's  assessment  that our  needs  would be better  served  by  superior technology. There were no comparable expenses in 2002.       Interest  expense  decreased  by $28,000 due to a decrease in the amount of debt  financing  we had  outstanding  in 2002  compared  to 2001.  Additionally, financing  costs  decreased  in 2002 by  $2,124,000  as we obtained  most of our financing  through the direct sale of equity  securities  compared to 2001 when, (1) shares were issued for  conversions  and  redemptions  under the convertible notes  payable  credit  facility  at modified  conversion  prices  resulting  in financing costs of $1,286,000,  (2) shares were issued in private  placements in connection  with  our note  payable  credit  facility  at  below  market  prices resulting  in financing  costs of $448,000 and (3) warrants  valued at $415,000, were issued in connection with private  placements of common stock in connection with our note payable credit facility.       During 2002, we disposed of certain fixed assets that resulted in a loss of $69,000. We did not have any of these disposals in 2001.       Net loss improved  approximately  $1,622,000  from  $10,636,000  in 2001 to $9,014,000 in 2002 due to the reasons discussed above.  Comparison of years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000        Total revenues  decreased  approximately  $297,000 from $326,000 in 2000 to $29,000 in 2001. The decrease is due to a decrease in Cymedix pilot program fees billed  during 2001 of $189,000,  and a decrease in ADC revenue of $108,000 as a result of discontinuing that business segment.       Software and technology costs increased  $423,000 or approximately 49% from $865,000 in 2000 to $1,288,000 in 2000, as a result of increased personnel costs incurred in the ongoing development of the Cymedix product line       Selling,  general and administrative  expenses  decreased  approximately 3% from $5,925,000 in 2000 to $5,746,000 in 2001. The decrease is attributable to a company wide salary reduction program that was undertaken early in 2001.       During 2001, we recorded  impairment  expense of $1,111,000  resulting from the  discontinuance  of our Automated  Design  Concepts  division  which totaled $443,000,  to  focus  staff  resources  on  our  primary  technology,   and  the cancellation  of our  Zirmed  license  totaling  $668,000  which was a result of management's  assessment  that our  needs  would be better  served  by  superior technology.       Other  income  decreased  approximately  $151,000  from 2000 to 2001.  This increase  reflects a decline in  interest  income that had been earned on excess cash  received  and  invested  during  2000 from the  exercise  of  options  and warrants.       Interest expense  increased  $61,000 from 2000 to 2001 due to interest that was paid on a convertible promissory note issued during 2001.       Financing  costs of $2,428,000 were incurred in 2001 due to warrants issued and an in-the money  conversion  feature in connection with the convertible debt credit  facility of $581,000,  a warrant issued in the private equity  placement valued at  $113,000,  and shares  issued in the  conversion  of debt and related equity  share  issuances  at below  market  prices  which  resulted  in costs of $1,734,000.       Net  gain  (loss)  from  discontinued  operations  decreased  approximately $929,000  from $929,000 in 2000 to $0 in 2001,  due to the sale during  February 2000 of the remaining assets of the company's staffing operations.       Net loss  increased  approximately  $5,221,000  from  $5,415,000 in 2000 to $10,636,000 in 2001 due to the reasons discussed above.  Liquidity and Capital Resources        We had  $1,369,000  in cash as of December  31, 2002  compared to $8,000 in cash as of December 31, 2001 and $1,007,000 as of December 31, 2000. Net working capital reflected a deficit of ($252,000) as of December 31, 2002, compared to a deficit of  ($1,404,000)  at  December  31, 2001 and a surplus of $394,000 as of December 31, 2000.       During 2002, net cash used in operating  activities was $5,469,000 compared to $5,397,000 in 2001. During 2002, we raised $5,125,000 from private placements of our common  stock net of offering  costs,  $1,000,000  from the issuance of a convertible  debenture,  $972,000 from our equity line of credit net of offering costs and $817,000 from exercise of options and warrants. During 2001, we raised $1,500,000 from a convertible note financing, $1,200,000 from private placements of our common stock, $1,510,000 from our equity line of credit and $369,000 from exercise of options and  warrants.  During 2000, we raised  $6,091,000  from the exercise of options and  warrants.  Our equity line of credit was  terminated in August 2002.       We are funding our operations now through the sale of our securities. There can be no assurance that additional  investments or financings will be available to us on  favorable  terms or at all as needed to support  the  development  and deployment of the Merged Technology.  Failure to obtain such capital on a timely basis  could  result  in lost  business  opportunities,  the sale of the  Merged Technology at a distressed price or the financial failure of our company.  Impacts of Accounting Standards        In June  2001,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  143,  "Accounting  for  Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 requires the fair value of a liability for an asset  retirement  obligation  to be  recognized in the period in which it is incurred  if a  reasonable  estimate of fair value can be made.  The  associated asset  retirement  costs are  capitalized as part of the carrying  amount of the long-lived  asset.  SFAS No. 143 is effective for years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company  believes the adoption of this statement will have no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.       In  August  2001,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  144,  "Accounting  for the Impairment  or Disposal of  Long-Lived  Assets."  SFAS 144  requires  that those long-lived  assets be measured  at the lower of  carrying  amount or fair value, less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing  operations or in discontinued operations. Therefore, discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable  value or include  amounts  for  operating  losses  that have not yet occurred. SFAS 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning   after  December  15,  2001  and,   generally,   are  to  be  applied prospectively.  The Company  believes that the adoption of this  statement  will have no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.       In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,  "Rescission of FASB No. 4, 44 and 64,  Amendment  of FASB No. 13,  and  Technical  Corrections."  SFAS No. 145 rescinds  FASB No. 4 "Reporting  Gains and Losses from  Extinguishments  of Debt Made to Satisfy  Sinking-Fund  Requirements."  This statement also rescinds SFAS No. 44 "Accounting for Intangible  Assets of Motor Carriers" and amends SFAS No. 13,  "Accounting  for Leases."  This  statement  is  effective  for fiscal years beginning  after  May 15,  2002.  The  Company  believes  the  adoption  of this statement will have no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.       In June  2002,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  146,  "Accounting  for  Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal  Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses accounting and  reporting  for  costs  associated  with  exit or  disposal  activities  and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, "Liability  Recognition for Certain  Employee  Termination  Benefits  and  Other  Costs to Exit an  Activity (Including  Certain Costs Incurred in a  Restructuring)."  SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability  for a cost  associated  with an exit or  disposal  activity be recognized and measured  initially at fair value when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective  for exit or disposal  activities  that are  initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. The Company believes the adoption of this statement will have no material impact on its  consolidated financial statements.       In November  2002, the FASB published  interpretation  No, 45  "Guarantor's Accounting  and  Disclosure  requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect Guarantees  of  Indebtedness  of  Others".  The  Interpretation  expands  on the accounting  guidance of Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and  incorporates  without change the provisions of FASB  Interpretation No. 34, which is being superseded. The Interpretation  elaborates on the existing disclosure  requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies  that at the time a company  issues a  guarantee,  that  company  must recognize  an initial  liability  for the fair value,  or market  value,  of the obligations it assumes under that  guarantee and must disclose that  information in its interim and annual  financial  statements.  The initial  recognition  and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified  after  December  31, 2002,  regardless  of the  guarantor's  fiscal year-end.  The disclosure  requirements in the  Interpretation are effective for financial  statements  of interim or annual  periods  ending after  December 15, 2002. The Company  believes the adoption of this statement will have no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.       In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148  "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-  Transition and  Disclosure."  This statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting  for Stock-Based  Compensation"  to provide  alternative  methods of transition  for an entity that  voluntarily  changes to the fair value method of accounting  for  stock-based  compensation.  In  addition,  SFAS 148  amends the disclosure  provision of SFAS 123 to require more prominent disclosure about the effects of an entity's  accounting  policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee  compensation  on reported  net  income.  The  effective  date for this Statement  is for fiscal years ended after  December  15, 2002.  The adoption of this  statement  did not have a material  effect on the  consolidated  financial statements  as the Company  continues  to account  for stock based  compensation under the  intrinsic  value  approach,  and  follows  the  pro-forma  disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No 148.
