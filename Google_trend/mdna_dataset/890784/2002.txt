BUSINESS  Our Company        Medix Resources,  Inc., a Colorado  corporation ("Medix" or the "Company"), is an information  technology company with its principal executive office in New York, New York. The Company also maintains offices in Agoura Hills,  California, Greenwood  Village,  Colorado  and  Marietta,  Georgia.  We  specialize  in  the development, marketing and management of software and connectivity solutions for clinical and business  transactions within the healthcare industry.  Through our wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Cymedix  Lynx  Corporation,  a Colorado  corporation ("Cymedix"),  we have developed the  Cymedix(R)suite  of software  products as a toolkit to help modernize physician and healthcare  communication technology and facilitate  transaction  productivity.  We  continue  to enhance  and refine our products to enable the many disparate  information systems within the healthcare industry to  communicate  with one another and to expand the scope of healthcare transaction automation.       The  Cymedix(R)suite  of products  facilitates the transmission of critical clinical,   financial  and   administrative   information   between   healthcare information systems, and provides healthcare institutions (such as health plans, insurers,  hospitals  and  practicing  physicians)  with  non-invasive  software products that can be integrated  with their existing  software  applications  to provide  Internet-enabled  transaction  capability  between  all  parties.  This approach is significant  because it offers substantial utility to physicians who are cautious about making major  adjustments  to their  practice  disciplines or reluctant to invest heavily in new, administrative technologies.       The implementation of Cymedix(R)software products targets improved efficacy of daily  interactions  between health  caregivers  and their staffs,  ancillary providers such as laboratories and pharmacy  benefit managers (PBMs),  insurance companies, hospitals, Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and Health Maintenance Organizations  (HMOs).  Recent State and Federal legislative actions, as well as industry  mandates to promote  quality  and the  privacy of patient  information while controlling  costs,  have created fertile ground for effective  technology solutions  that unite systems and enable digital  communication.  The market for robust and practical  healthcare  solutions  will grow rapidly,  and that growth will continue to accelerate as the joined emphases of consumer choice,  quality, administrative  service  and  cost-containment  ratchet  up the  demand for more efficient and user-friendly methods of delivering quality healthcare.       Moreover,  Medix understands the essentially local nature of healthcare and will deploy  Cymedix(R)software  products only in regions where we can guarantee that each installed  physician can use our  technologies to serve most of his or her   patients.   This   disciplined   market   approach,   combined   with  the Cymedix(R)suite of  physician-centric  software products,  provides a foundation for rapid adoption,  ongoing utilization and stable,  recurring revenue streams. Our  regional  strategy  and  focus  on  authentic  physician  adoption  is what differentiates us from most eHealth companies, including those who have survived the rough justice of today's market, as well as the many who have perished.       Medix was  incorporated  in the  State of  Colorado  in 1988.  For the next decade, the Company operated as a temporary  healthcare  staffing company,  with offices at various  times in Colorado,  New York,  Texas and  California.  Medix disposed of the its remaining  healthcare  staffing operations in February 2000. In  January  1998,  the  Company  acquired  Cymedix  Corporation,  a  California corporation,  which was  merged  into our  wholly  owned  healthcare  technology subsidiary, Cymedix Lynx Corporation.       As of March 15,  2002,  we are in various  stages of  project  development, testing and market  implementation  with six  clients  using  components  of the Cymedix(R)software  suite to link healthcare participants by using the Internet. While none of these projects have generated any significant revenues to date, if funding can be obtained to continue and expand our  operations,  these  projects should  position us as one of the  technology  leaders in the  emerging  eHealth industry.  All of these  projects  involve  working with an existing  healthcare insurer,   reference  laboratory  or  pharmacy  benefit  management  company  to integrate selected  Cymedix(R)products  into their networks to enable physicians to use those products for pharmacy  management  transactions,  laboratory orders and results reporting or claims processing. See "Forward-Looking  Statements and Associated  Risks"  under  "MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION below.       Our principal  executive office is located at 420 Lexington  Avenue,  Suite 1830,  New York,  NY 10170,  and its  telephone  number is (212)  697-2509.  Our principal  administrative  office  is at 7100  East  Belleview  Ave.,  Greenwood Village, CO 80111, and its telephone number is (303) 741-2045.  Recent Developments        We executed an Amended and  Restated  Common  Stock  Purchase  Warrant with WellPoint  Pharmacy  Management a wholly owned  subsidiary  of WellPoint  Health Networks Inc.,  dated February 18, 2002, to restructure our obligations to issue warrants to  WellPoint.  Under that  Warrant,  we are  obligated  to issue up to 7,000,000  shares of our common stock at exercise  prices of $0.30 per share for 3,000,000,  $0.50  per  share  for  3,000,000  shares  and  $1.75  per share for 1,000,000  shares,  if various  performance  related  vesting  requirements  are satisfied by WellPoint.  Currently,  WellPoint  has  satisfied  certain of these requirements  giving  WellPoint  the right to purchase  1,850,000  shares of our common  stock at $0.30  per  share.  The  Warrant  grants to  WellPoint  certain registration  rights to require us to register with the SEC the shares issued to WellPoint  for resale to the public.  In the  Warrant,  WellPoint  has agreed to restrict  sales to the public of these  shares  during the first year after they have been  issued to  200,000  shares per month and  100,000  shares in any five trading days. The Warrant contains  anti-dilution  provisions providing that the number of shares that may be  purchased  by  WellPoint  under the Warrant may be adjusted in certain  circumstances.  WellPoint's  rights to purchase  our shares under the Warrant expire on September 8, 2004.       We entered into a secured convertible loan agreement with WellPoint,  dated February  19,  2002,  pursuant to which we borrowed  $1,000,000  from  WellPoint Health  Networks  Inc.  The loan becomes  payable on February  19, 2003,  if not converted  into our common stock.  The loan earns annual  interest at a floating rate of 300 basis points over prime, as it is adjusted from time to time,  which is also payable at maturity and may be converted  into common stock.  Conversion into common stock is at the option of either  WellPoint or Medix at a contingent conversion  price. The conversion price will be either (i) at the price at which additional shares are sold to other private placement investors if Medix obtains written commitments for at least an additional $4,000,000 of equity by the close of business on September 30, 2002, from persons not affiliates of WellPoint, and if such sales are closed by the  maturity  date of the loan,  or (ii) at a price equal to 80% of the  then-current  Fair Market Value (as defined below) if Medix is unable to obtain a written commitment for the additional equity investment by the close of business on  September  30, 2002 or close the sales by the maturity date. For this purpose,  "Fair Market Value" shall be the average  closing price of Medix common stock for the twenty trading days ending on the day prior to the day of the conversion.  The loan is secured by the grant of a security  interest in all Medix's  intellectual  property,  including  its patent,  copyrights  and trademarks.  While Medix can cure a default in the  repayment of the loan at the fixed maturity date by the forced  conversion of the loan into its common stock, a cross default, breach of representation or warranty, and bankruptcy or similar event  of  default  will  trigger  the  foreclosure  provision  of the  security agreement.  The Company expects to require  conversion at the earliest  possible time,  which may be before September 30, 2002 if the required funds are received at which point the pledge of collateral will be received.       In October 2001,  Medix announced the  introduction of  Cymedix(R)III,  the next generation of its  proprietary,  point-of-care  products.  Cymedix(R)III is based upon a robust and device-neutral  architecture that leverages  established workstation,  handheld and wireless  technologies  and supports Medix' long-term commitment  to  support  emerging  exam  room  and  point-of-care  technologies. Cymedix(R)III  products,  including working applications for Cymedix(R)Pharmacy, Laboratory  and  PlanConnect  services,  will be made available to physicians in 2002. Until recently,  the combination of expensive,  front-end  equipment costs coupled  with   time-consuming   and  often  problematic  data   synchronization requirements  effectively  dampened  the  physician's  appetite  for  any of the point-of-care  technologies being offered. Our new Cymedix(R)III architecture is both  fully  scalable  and  device-neutral,   allowing  our  Pharmacy,  Lab  and PlanConnect  products to be delivered  via  workstation  and  wireless  handheld devices with the  technologies  available  today as well as those of the future. The addition of wireless  capability  within our  Cymedix(R)III  product release naturally  complements  the Medix  suite of  transaction  products,  and enables physicians  and their  office  staff to execute the full range of  clinical  and support  transactions from their office workstation,  their home desktop or from the exam room itself,  via a handheld device with real-time  synchronization  of secure patient data. We believe that the expanded  capabilities of Cymedix(R)III offer a  compelling  value  return  for  physicians  and will  accelerate  their adoption of our technology.       Finally, during 2001, we ceased operations of our Automated Design Concepts division (ADC), a Web design business.  We had acquired ADC in early 2000 from a former  officer  and  director  of the  Company  for cash and  stock  valued  at $474,000.  In connection with our general cost reduction program,  we determined that the business of the subsidiary was not part of our core business operations and  therefore did not justify our continued  financial  support.  In connection with the  termination  of our  subsidiary's  operations  we took a write-off  of goodwill  in the amount of  $443,000.  We also  determined  that our  license of proprietary  software from  ZirMed.com had no value to us and had no more than a nominal market value. In 2001, we wrote-off the unamortized value of the related intangible asset, which was $668,000.  Our Industry        The U.S.  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services  (formerly the Health Care Finance Administration) estimates that $1.4 trillion dollars, or 14% of the U.S.  Gross  domestic  product,  is spent  annually  on  healthcare.  Healthcare expenditures are expected to grow to approximately $2.8 trillion by 2011, due to increasingly   expensive  and  sophisticated   clinical  technology,   an  aging population base and the growing demands of newly-empowered  and health conscious consumers.       Every year, the healthcare industry conducts its business by executing more than 30 billion transactions, more than 90% of which are untouched by integrated automation.   Core   transactions   --  such  as  enrollment   and   eligibility verification,   referrals  and  authorizations,   lab  orders  and  lab  results reporting,  billing and claims and  prescription-writing  with drug  interaction checks  -- are  processed  through a  disjointed  matrix  of  isolated  systems, including  paper,  fax and  phone.  Of  necessity,  every  provider,  insurer or supplier has invested in its own  proprietary and often  antiquated  information system. As a result,  duplication is rampant,  error  probabilities are enormous and the waste of precious resources is glaringly obvious.       Health  economists  estimate  that  20%  or  more  of  the  nation's  total healthcare expenditures is spent on backroom  administration.  Another 10% funds the  fallout  of  adverse  health  events  that  are  caused  by  inaccurate  or unavailable patient information.  The cumulative effect is that, more than 4% of our  nation's  annual  economic  output  is  being  consumed  by a  service  and transactions industry that pleases no one and angers many.       Today's  inefficient and "silo" healthcare  information systems are created by the extreme fragmentation and complexity of the industry. Briefly:  o    Healthcare remains a quintessentially cottage industry. There are currently      approximately  645,000  practicing  physicians,   6,200  hospitals,  16,500      nursing  homes,   8,000  home  health  care  agencies,   4,500  independent      laboratories  and  thousands  of  managed  care   organizations  and  other      ancillary (usually local) health care providers.  o    The various  constituents  of healthcare have sharply  different  levels of      access  to  capital.  Typically,  insurers  have had the  finances  to fund      large-scale  systems  able to  structure  and  share  uniform  information.      Physicians  do  not.  This  imbalance  has  produced  an  industry  rich in      proprietary    administrative   systems   but   poor   in   patient-focused      point-of-care information systems.  o    Government  regulation  of the  industry  is  splintered  across 50 states,      coupled with substantial federal intervention.  o    Healthcare  is an  extremely  complex  business.  Literally,  errors can be      life-threatening.   Until  recently,  affordable  technologies  capable  of      replacing wasteful,  but comparatively safe  administrative  practices were      not available.        The Internet provides a platform for catalytic change within the healthcare industry. Grabbing hold of that opportunity requires the deployment of effective connectivity  tools that enable disparate  systems to effectively and affordably communicate with one another. The Internet's emerging,, ubiquitous accessibility and   growing   acceptance   make  it  an   increasingly   critical   tool   for business-to-business and business-to-consumer  interaction.  Moreover,  Internet use is undergoing a transformation from simple,  static information  publishing, messaging,  and data gathering to real-time,  interactive  applications that are capable of  supporting  core  business  transactions  and  fundamental  business processes.       In many  industries,  work is in  progress  to  harness  the  power  of the Internet  and to fuse  previously  disconnected  business  processes  that allow companies to reengineer workflows,  reduce administrative and distribution costs and leverage core-competency,  expert resources. Because of its size, complexity and  dependence  on accurate and timely  information  exchange,  the  healthcare industry is well suited to benefit from the  connectivity  and data  integration solutions  that we are  developing.  In  addition,  as more  and  more  powerful technology  tools  become  available  at  decreasing  cost  levels,   (including workstations,   handheld  devices  and  wireless  networks),   we  believe  that physicians will acquire more advanced  technology  platforms to optimize patient care, automate processes and better leverage their clinical experience.       Administrative  processes in healthcare consume  approximately $300 billion per year.  Insurers  typically spend 10-12% of gross premiums in administration, not including  sales  acquisition  costs. A typical  physician  practice  spends between 25%-50% of gross billings on administration. Medix's mission is to offer a set of tools to  physicians  and to  insurers  that  takes  direct  aim at the present tab of administrative  cost and reduces the potential of clinical error. For the eHealth industry, we believe it to be a $20 billion opportunity.  Our Products and Technology        Cymedix(R)is  a suite of  software  products  and  integration  tools  that seamlessly moves clinical and administrative  information among health insurers, physicians,   pharmacy   benefit   management   companies  and  reference  labs. Collectively,  they create an indispensable,  non-invasive  technology  platform that  establishes  secure  connectivity  among the many isolated  systems of the healthcare industry. The Cymedix(R)platform enables physicians or their staff to use software that  transparently  performs the timesaving  activity of gathering and  transmitting  vital  patient  information  to  healthcare  entities.  Since physicians   can   offload   substantial    administrative    burdens   to   the Cymedix(R)software  products, we believe they will see the opportunity to employ the Cymedix(R)product suite (PBM, payor, pharmacy, lab and hospital connections) to improve the quality of patient care and to grow their business.       We deliver our  solutions  via the Internet  using secure socket layers and other encryption  technologies  that protect  confidential  patient  information while reducing the physician's  need to purchase and manage on-site hardware and software systems.  The Cymedix(R)suite of products may be utilized on any device that supports an Internet browser,  allowing our software to run on a wide range of  equipment,   from  aging  personal  computers  to  leading  edge  exam  room technologies (handheld devices,  tablets,  etc.). In addition, the advent of low cost,  secure  wireless  networking  solutions  makes the last inch of the "last mile" of physician practice  implementation vastly easier today than even a year ago.       Our Cymedix(R)Universal Interface (CUI) is central to the implementation of the  Cymedix(R)suite  of products.  Physicians  generally  reject new technology solutions  that  require new  investments  in time or money over and above their primary investment in practice management systems.  Therefore,  we believe it is imperative  to  deliver  solutions  that  effectively  leverage  their  practice management  investment  at no  additional  cost.  The CUI toolkit  automatically extracts  pre-selected  data  elements  from  existing  systems  and  remaps the targeted  information for use by the  Cymedix(R)software  suite. This technology permits the  Cymedix(R)suite  to  efficiently  and  effectively  integrate  with virtually any practice  management system,  thereby eliminating the need to hard code unique,  expensive and time-consuming  interfaces.  Typically, the practice management system is the only administrative information system in a physician's practice and is therefore the most trusted  source for patient and billing data. The CUI  enables  the  physician's  staff to embrace  the  Cymedix(R)suite  as a value-added  adjunct of their legacy  practice  management  system,  all without having to bear  duplicative  processes such as the re-keying of critical patient data.  The Cymedix(R)software suite of products includes:       ----------------------------  --------------------------------------                                     o  Pharmacy benefit manager      Cymedix(R)Pharmacy   >>>>        identification (eligibility                                       verification and an automatic                                       link to formulary/benefits                                       information.)                                    o  Electronic prescribing (retail                                       and mail order).                                    o  Medication history.                                    o  Treatment and formulary                                       compliance.                                    o  Drug to drug interaction, drug to                                       allergy, duplicate therapy and                                       other clinical checks.                                    o  Messaging and prompts.                                    o  Compliance analysis                                    o  Complete lab order entry.

The introduction of our proprietary,  point-of-care  products is proceeding with our six active  customers.  Our suite of software  products is based upon a robust  and  device-neutral  architecture  that  leverages  proven  workstation, handheld  and  wireless  technologies.  Our  Cymedix(R)technology   architecture includes a flexible  integration  framework that facilitates  rapid and reliable connectivity  efforts.  All product components,  including  Cymedix(R) Pharmacy, Cymedix(R) Laboratory and Cymedix(R)PlanConnect services are in final testing as we prepare for production-level physician installations in second quarter 2002.       On the sponsor host side, we are in late-stage  development and testing for customized  integrations  with  each  of our  active  contracts.  When we sign a connectivity  agreement with a transaction  sponsor (PBM, payor, lab,  hospital, etc.),  we move into a disciplined  integration  phase in which we establish the interface connection to the sponsor,  enable transactions,  tailor the front-end to the sponsor's requirements, and incorporate any sponsor-specific rules within our applications.  Generally,  this integration phase should take between 90-120 days,  depending upon the pace, regimen and internal resource  allocation set by our  customers.  However,  as we have learned with  earlier  pilots,  these time frames are  variable  and may be extended  indefinitely  for reasons  beyond our control. After the integration phase is completed, we move to the deployment and production phase when transaction fee revenues will be generated.       We have targeted our initial,  production-level  physician installations to begin in second quarter 2002 and we currently expect transaction fee revenues to commence  before the end of the second  quarter  2002.  While we had expected to begin receiving such revenues in the first quarter of 2002, the scope and timing of several sponsor host integrations  required that we push the physician launch date to the next quarter.  As a result,  we have yet to receive any  transaction fee revenue.       The marketing and development of our  Cymedix(R)suite  of software products is our  sole  business  at  this  time,  and a  substantial  portion  of our net operating  loss is due to such efforts.  We are funding such expenses as well as our administrative expenses through the sale of our securities.  Our Sponsor Customer Relationships        As an eHealth connectivity company, Medix must build relationships with two sets of customers: physician end-users and sponsor host institutions,  including health plans,  pharmacy  benefit  managers,  reference  laboratories  and other, ancillary types of managed care networks. These sponsor organizations, typically large  enterprises,  pay our  per-click  transaction  fees as  described  in the section titled "Our Strategy and Business Model" below. Our  relationships  with WellPoint  Pharmacy  Management,  Merck-Medco  and  Express  Scripts,  Inc.  all recorded key sponsor customer events in 2001  WellPoint Pharmacy Management        In 2001,  Medix  announced  that we had  completed  our pilot  program with WellPoint  Pharmacy  Management  (WPM)  and  a  joint  deployment  of  Web-based transactions  services  to WPM health  plan  customers  and their  participating physicians  will begin during 2002. WPM has long committed to providing value to customers,   patients  and  physician   partners   through  the  elimination  of administrative  waste, clinical error, fraud and abuse. They enjoy a well-earned reputation  for  extraordinary  growth  and  clinical  programs  of  excellence. Together,  Medix and WPM have  forged  deep,  long-term  ties  bound by a common objective to provide physicians with the tools and means to elevate the clinical experience  through shared  information and decision  support.  Our robust pilot program with WPM,  combined with the gathering  momentum in the emerging eHealth industry,  has allowed Medix to strengthen  our sales pipeline over a compressed timeframe.  In  addition,  our  multi  dimensional   relationship  involves  the following:        Product Distribution  - Through the execution of an amendment to the Warrant Agreement,  WellPoint Pharmacy Management has formally agreed to recommend Medix Resources,  Inc. to their  customers  and key vendors.  WPM enjoys a diversified customer  base  that  includes  health  plans,   employers  and  regional  PBMs. Initially, Medix and WPM are focusing joint sales activities on WPM's large Blue Cross Blue Shield plan customers. Executing customer agreements with WPM's large customers  will provide Medix with  significant  patient  density in several key markets. Under a formal agreement with specific targets and incentives, WPM will earn warrants in Medix shares when  WPM-sponsored  customers  agree to implement the Cymedix(R) technology set.        Product  Development  - Medix and WPM are executing a shared,  formal agenda to  continually  research,  test and implement new product  enhancements.  These collaborative  product development efforts offer a substantive benefit to Medix, as WPM  possesses a powerful  repository  of  pharmacy  industry  knowledge  and distinguished clinical expertise.       Our longstanding and close working  relationship  with WPM is a significant asset,  especially as they are a first-rate  reference  with which we can expand our reach to healthcare's other large constituencies.  Merck-Medco and Express Scripts, Inc.        In October 2001, we announced  agreements with two of the nation's  leading pharmacy benefit managers,  Merck-Medco and Express Scripts, Inc. These business relationships  allow us to  provide  physicians  with  point-of-care  access  to clinical information and electronic prescribing. Client integration work is well underway  and we will  shortly  begin  joint  deployment  of these  services  to Merck-Medco and Express Scripts health plan customers and physicians.  Different than the  start-up  of our WPM  relationship,  neither  Merck-Medco  nor Express Scripts requires a phased product pilot program.       Our  agreements   with   Merck-Medco  and  Express  Scripts  are  important milestones  for Medix.  Merck-Medco  is the  nation's  second  largest  pharmacy benefits  manager,  with a  client  roster  that  includes  major  insurers  and corporations  throughout  the  nation  and more  importantly  within  our target markets.  Likewise,  Express  Scripts,  Inc. is an ideal match  because of their demonstrated market leadership. Both Merck-Medco and Express Scripts are leading sponsors of technology initiatives that place decision-making tools in the hands of  physicians  at the point of care.  Together,  our joint efforts will provide physicians and their staffs with easy-to-use connectivity solutions that support all aspects of the prescription process.  Our Strategy and Business Model         General.   Our market  strategy is  organized  around  several  well-defined components.  First,  we believe  that there is  significant  value  attached  to offering products that complement today's commonly available technologies.  This is a critical  aspect of the added value that we bring to our sponsor  customers and  physicians.  For  Medix,  it means  delivering  connectivity  and  software solutions  that  take into  consideration  our  users'  current  technology  and workflows.  For example,  many  physician  practices  have not yet invested in a high-speed  (DSL/cable)  Internet  connection.  Therefore  we have  designed our products to excel at every level of  connectivity,  from the less  sophisticated dial-up capability to high speed, persistent connections.       Second, our business model is a per-click transaction fee model paid for by large institutional sponsors with an interest in enabling their connectivity and information  sharing with physician  offices.  Physicians'  offices operate on a private network created by Medix and financed by per click transaction fees from sponsoring  institutions.  We expect  that this  approach  will offer  favorable returns  to  sponsoring   institutions  through  aggregate   administrative  and underwriting cost savings while enabling physicians' offices to reduce paperwork and costs within their practice environment with no front-end investment. In the longer term, as the value proposition  becomes more obvious to physicians,  they may elect to pay for an expanded suite of services.       Third, we believe that the functionality  provided by the Cymedix(R)product suite,  together with the CUI,  gives us a distinct  competitive  advantage.  By enabling  physician  practices  to  continue to use their  existing  information systems while accessing our non-invasive technology,  we recognize and honor the physician's  investment in their choice of practice management  technology.  Our approach recognizes that, as in medicine, our first duty is to do no harm. Thus, while the  Cymedix(R)product  suite offers  attractive  timesaving  clinical and administrative capabilities,  our products do not put at risk any of the assumed "safe" features of today's processes.       Fourth,  we act as support  partners to our customers and users. Our intent is to leave the business of medicine to  physicians  and the business of managed care to managed care companies.  We bring value by constructing safe and secure, high-speed  data  highways  that enable  connectivity  and  provide  hassle-free productivity tools for all users.       Finally,  we believe that our  approach and the products  that we make take direct aim at the wasteful  administration costs that plague all of healthcare's stakeholders.  Our  internal  standards  mandate  that  we  make  a  substantive difference  in this  area,  and we ask our  users  and  customers  to  judge  us accordingly.       Taken  together,   these  strategy   components   position  Medix  to  earn substantial,  recurring revenue streams at attractive  margins.  Moreover,  once critical  density is reached,  continued  growth in our core product line can be supported  without  substantial  reinvestment  in added  support or  fulfillment infrastructure, further leveraging our market investment returns for the future.       Our plan to secure long-term  recurring revenue streams via the creation of contractual  relationships  with large sponsors is well underway.  As physicians grow  to  appreciate  the  benefit  of  our  institutionally  sponsored  product offerings  and to  recognize  the  value of  clinical  and  administrative  data captured  during ongoing use of our product suite, we believe we can establish a market for  physician-centric  enhancements  and add-ons to our products.  Medix plans to offer physicians  additional  timesaving  features that further improve patient  care  and  practice   profitability.   Among  these  features  will  be connectivity  gateways to non-sponsored  transactions,  charge capture,  patient relationship  management  services  and  document  management.  We  expect  that physicians will pay for these  additional  services under a subscription  model. Broadly cast, our business model follows the following regimen:  |X|  Medix   establishes  a  connection   between  sponsor   organizations   and      physicians.  |X|  Using the CUI and our product suite, physicians and practice administrators      drive  transactions  via their  practice  management  systems,  handheld or      wireless devices, or through a direct Internet connection to Medix servers.  |X|  Sponsor organizations pay for transactions.  |X|  Physicians  will pay for  subscription  services  to gain  access to future      product  enhancements that leverage their  administrative  efficiencies and      clinical effectiveness.        Our Regional  Strategy.   Healthcare  services are  insured,  delivered  and remunerated  differently  from one  region to  another.  Medix  understands  the essential,  local  nature  of  healthcare  and  will  deploy  Cymedix(R)software products only in regions where we can assure that each  installed  physician can use our  technologies  to serve most of his or her  patients.  This  disciplined market  approach,   combined  with  the  Cymedix(R)suite  of  physician-oriented software  products,  provides a foundation  for rapid  adoption,  and  sustained physician  utilization.   Moreover,  we  believe  that  contracting  with  large communities  of  physicians  and sponsor  organizations  within  highly  defined geographies  creates a highly  desirable  financial and  operating  scenario for Medix as well as lasting brand presence that sharply  differentiates us from our competition.       Given  adequate  long term  financing,  we intend  to  initially  focus our resources on deploying the  Cymedix(R)software  suite in five markets.  They are Atlanta,  Northern California,  Southern  California,  the New York Metropolitan Area, and Chicago.  As of March 2002, our Atlanta market development efforts are underway with a planned Q2, 2002 product launch.       See  "Forward-Looking  Statements and Associated Risks" under "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" below.  Our Marketing and Sales Approach        The Company intends to pursue a focused but multi-dimensional marketing and sales strategy over the next several years. Specifically:  o    We will concentrate our energies on selected,  geographical  target markets      that provide ample  transaction  potential and offer us the  opportunity to      penetrate a significant share of physician desktops.  o    We will seek to partner  first with a leading,  anchor client or consortium      of anchor clients in each of the selected markets.  o    Following  platform   development  with  the  anchor  client(s),   we  will      concentrate  our sales  focus on  enlisting  the second  tier of  potential      customers,  including corollary agreements with regional-specific suppliers      such as  pharmacy  benefit  managers,  labs and large,  organized  provider      groups. Our goal is to achieve major market density.  o    Concurrent with the market breadth effort described above, the Company will      aggressively  seek added market depth by up-selling and  cross-selling  the      full  portfolio  of  product  services  to  existing  customers  and  their      affiliates.  o    As our brand and  presence  gains  local  strength,  we will seek to market      relevant  enhancements and add-ons to our products  directly to physicians,      using a monthly subscription model.  Sales Process        Most of our customers are large health plans,  PBM's and lab companies that are national in scope, but are operated on a local or regional basis. Therefore, it is imperative to organize sales efforts at both the national and local levels to close sales, gain market share and retain existing customers. Consistent with our  regional  approach  to market  sales and  implementations,  the Medix sales process draws resources and experience from both corporate and regional teams.         ----------------------------------     ---------------------------------         National Sales Process Team            Regional Sales Process Teams         |X|   CEO                              |X|   Regional Market CEO        |X|   EVP & CTO                        |X|   Local Implementation Team        |X|   EVP Operations                   |X|   Local Consultants (as        |X|   Selected Technology Team                needed)               Members                         |X|   Selected Technology Team                                                      Members         ----------------------------------     ---------------------------------       Medix views the sales process to gain customer  relationships as a two-step process.  This  process can happen  sequentially  or be pursued  along  parallel tracks.  The national  sales process team is  responsible  for  negotiating  and executing  contracts  as well as  charged  with  the  responsibility  to  expand customer  relationships  in terms  of  product  base or  market  expansion.  The regional sales process team is  responsible  for local account sales and account management and the local administration of the sale's execution for our national customers.       At present, our executive staff devotes a substantive portion of their time to sales,  marketing  and  account  management  activities.  Longer  term,  with appropriate  financing  in place,  we expect to  recruit  and hire a new head of Corporate Business Development,  as well as to staff our regional  organizations with resident sales professionals to complement current resources.       Outside   consultants   have  been  engaged  to  assist  with  sales  leads development and  target-customer  introductions.  Outside  contractors also have been  retained  to  develop  marketing  and  sales  literature  for the  Cymedix software.  Materials  to promote  the  various  Cymedix  applications  are being developed for direct mailing to physicians affiliated with our customers.  Competition         eHealth  Services.   The market for  eHealth  services is  evolving,  highly fragmented  and  subject  to  fast-moving  technological  change.  Although  our competitive position is difficult to characterize,  due principally to the youth of our market  niche and the  diversity  of current and future  competitors,  we believe the primary competitive  elements in the eHealth  connectivity  business are: (i) the scope,  quality and performance of the technologies  offered;  (ii) rates of physician adoption and sustained  utilization;  and (iii) the integrity and market-worthiness of pricing and data models.       We  believe  our  principal  competitive  advantages  are:  (i) our  robust technology architecture;  (ii) our CUI toolkit; (iii) our clinical product base; (iiii) our  regional  and  physician-centric  focus;  and (iiiii)  our  customer relationships.  There are other  connectivity  companies,  in the United States, both publicly held and private,  that compete  directly or indirectly with Medix Resources, Inc. Moreover, competition can be expected to emerge from established healthcare  information vendors and established or new Internet related vendors. The most likely  competitors are companies with a focus on clinical  information systems and enterprises with an Internet  commerce or electronic  network focus. Currently,  we view our main  competitors  as  WebMD,  ProxyMed,  NaviMedix  and AllScripts. These competitors may have greater financial marketing or technology resources  than us. We will  seek to raise  capital  to  develop  and  implement Cymedix products in a timely manner,  however,  so long as our operations remain under funded, as they are now, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.        Software  Development  Personnel.   The  success of the  development  of our Cymedix software is dependent to a significant  degree on our key management and technical  personnel.  We believe  that our  success  will also  depend upon our ability to attract,  motivate and retain highly skilled,  managerial,  sales and marketing,  and technical personnel,  including software programmers and systems architects  skilled in the  computer  languages  in which our  Cymedix  products operate. Competition for such personnel in the software and information services industries is intense.  The loss of key  personnel,  or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel,  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.  Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights        US Patent No 5,995,939 was issued on November 30, 1999 to our  wholly-owned subsidiary,  Cymedix Lynx  Corporation from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO").  The patent  covers our  automated  service  request and  fulfillment system and will expire October 14, 2017. A divisional U.S.  patent  application, including  five  claims  directed  to the  method by which the  system  operates through the Cymedix Universal Interface, has been abandoned       The USPTO issued to Cymedix U.S.  Trademark  Registration No. 2,269,377 for the mark  CYMEDIX  in  connection  with  "computer  software  for data  base and electronic  record  management in the healthcare field" on August 10, 1999, U.S. Trademark  Registration  No.  2,316,240  for the mark  LYNX in  connection  with "computer  software to provide secure  communication  on a global  communication information  network" on February 8, 2000, and U.S.  Trademark  Registration No. 2,409,248 for the mark  CYMEDIX.COM in connection  with  "computer  software for database and electronic  record  management in the healthcare field" on November 28, 2000.       Cymedix has obtained seven copyright registrations for two versions of each of three modular software  components of the Cymedix suite of products,  as well as a technical evaluation document that describes the software products.       No assurance  can be given that any of our software  products  will receive additional  patent  or  other  intellectual  property  protection.  Cymedix  has assigned the above patent and copyrights registrations to Medix.       We seek to protect our software,  documentation and other written materials primarily  through a combination of trade secret,  trademark and copyright laws, confidentiality  procedures and contractual provisions.  In addition, we seek to avoid disclosure of our trade secrets,  by, among other things,  requiring those persons with access to our  proprietary  information to execute  confidentiality agreements with us and restricting access to our source code.       Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use  information  that we  regard  as  proprietary.  Policing  unauthorized  use  of  our  products  is difficult.  While we are unable to  determine  the extent to which piracy of our products  exists,  software  piracy can be expected to be a persistent  problem, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.       From time to time, we are involved in intellectual  property  disputes.  We may notify others that we believe their products  infringe upon our intellectual property  rights,  and we may be notified by others that they  believe  that our products  infringe  on  their  intellectual  property  rights.  We  expect  that providers of eHealth  solutions  will  increasingly  be subject to  infringement claims as the number of  products  and  competitors  in our  industry  grows and traditional  suppliers of health care data and  transaction  solutions  begin to offer  Internet-based  products.  If our proprietary  technology is subjected to infringement  claims,  we may  have to  expend  substantial  amounts  to  defend ourselves,  and, if we lose,  pay damages or seek a license from third  parties, which  could delay  sales of our  products.  If our  proprietary  technology  is infringed  upon,  we may have to expend  substantial  amounts to  prosecute  the infringing parties,  and we may experience losses if we cannot support our claim of infringement.       We have been notified by a party that it believes our pharmacy  product may infringe on patents that it holds.  We have retained patent counsel who has made a preliminary investigation and determined that our product does not infringe on the identified patents. At this time no legal action has been instituted.  Government Regulation        Federal  and  state  laws and  regulations  regulate  many  aspects  of our business.  Since  sanctions  may  be  imposed  for  violations  of  these  laws, compliance  is a  significant  operational  requirement.  We  believe  we are in substantial  compliance  with all existing  legal  requirements  material to the operation  of our  businesses.  There are,  however,  significant  uncertainties involving the  application of many of these legal  requirements to our business. We are  unable to  predict  what  additional  federal  or state  legislation  or regulatory  initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health  care  industry in general,  or what effect any such  legislation  or regulations  might have on us. We cannot  provide any assurance  that federal or state   governments   will  not   impose   additional   restrictions   or  adopt interpretations  of existing laws that could have a material  adverse  affect on our results or operations, financial position and/or cash flow from operations.        HIPAA and Standardized  Transactions.   Our sponsor  customers and physician users must comply with the Administration Simplification provision of the Health Insurance  Portability and  Accountability  Act of 1996 (HIPAA),  which includes regulations  for  privacy,  transactions,   code  sets,  security  and  standard identifiers.   Final   regulations  and   implementation   deadlines  exist  for transactions,  code sets and privacy while only proposed  regulations  exist for security  and  standard  identifiers.  Accordingly,  our  products  must contain features and  functionality  that allow our  customers  and users to comply with existing law.       As the effective date of the HIPAA regulations  approach,  they will have a major  impact  on us as  well  as  every  other  participant  in the  healthcare industry. Significant resources will be required to implement these regulations. Major  retooling of medical  information  technology will be required to install the required  standardized  codes and procedures.  Transaction  standards,  code sets,  and  identifiers  will  need to be  installed  on  medical  participants' networks and office computers. Security and privacy regulations will be the most difficult  to  implement  and  maintain  because  they are broad in scope,  less definitive,  and require ongoing vigilance to assure compliance.  Estimate costs of implementation vary widely but will be in the billion of dollars.  Failure to comply could put us or any other healthcare participant out of business.       We believe that our  Cymedix(R)software  product  offerings are designed to allow for full compliance with known HIPAA regulations.  However, until all such regulations are issued and final,  they could be modified,  which may require us to  expend  additional  resources  to  comply  with the  revised  standards.  In addition,  given  their  novelty,  breadth  in  scope,  and  uncertainty  as  to interpretation,   implementation  will  be  uncertain  and  the  possibility  of inadvertently failing to meet these standards is high. Such failure could result in fines and penalties being assessed against us or cause our business to suffer in other ways.        Government Regulation of the Internet.   Laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other on-line  services  covering issues such as user privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution and characteristics and quality of  products  and  services.  The  adoption  of any  additional  laws or regulations  may impede the growth of the  Internet or other  on-line  services, which could,  in turn,  decrease the demand for our  software  applications  and services,  increase our cost of doing  business,  or  otherwise  have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the  applicability  to the  Internet of existing  laws in various  jurisdictions governing issues such as property  ownership,  sales and other taxes,  libel and personal  privacy  is  uncertain  and may take  years to  resolve.  Any such new legislation  or  regulation,  the  application  of  laws  and  regulations  from jurisdictions  whose  laws  do  not  currently  apply  to our  business,  or the application  of existing laws and  regulations  to the Internet and other online services  could  have a  material  adverse  effect  on our  business,  financial condition and results of operations.        Confidentiality and Security.  While HIPAA regulations,  as discussed above, are  expected to  generally  govern in this area,  regulation  by various  state agencies  may also still  apply to  confidentiality  of patient  records and the circumstances  under which such  records may be released  for  inclusion  in our databases.   Such  regulations  govern  both  the  disclosure  and  the  use  of confidential  patient medical records.  Such regulation could require holders of such information,  including us, to implement costly security  measures,  or may materially  restrict the ability of health care providers to submit  information from patient records using our  applications.  We utilize an  architecture  that incorporates encrypted messaging, firewalls and other security methods to assure customers of a compliant and secure computing environment.  However, no security procedure  is failsafe,  and we will always be subject to a potential  breach of security by wither  determined  human effort or inadvertent  human error.  If we were  found  liable  for any such  breach,  such  finding  could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.        False  Claims Act.   Under the federal  False Claims Act,  liability  may be imposed on any  individual or entity who knowingly  submits or  participates  in submitting  claims for  payment  to the  federal  government  which are false or fraudulent, or which contain false or misleading information. Liability may also be imposed on any  individual or entity who knowingly make or use a false record or statement to avoid an obligation to pay the federal government. Certain state laws impose similar liability.  The federal government or private whistleblowers may bring claims under the federal  False Claims Act. If we are found liable for a violation of the federal  False  Claims Act, or any similar  state law, due to our processing of claims for Medicaid and Medicare, it may result in substantial civil  and  criminal  penalties.  In  addition,  we  could  be  prohibited  from processing Medicaid or Medicare claims for payment.        Government Investigations.  There is significant scrutiny by law enforcement authorities,  the U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  Office  of Inspector  General,  the courts and Congress of  agreements  between  healthcare providers and suppliers or other  contractors  that have a potential to increase utilization of government  health care  resources.  In particular,  scrutiny has been  placed on the  coding of  claims  for  payment,  incentive  programs  that increase use of a product and  contracted  billing  arrangements.  Investigators have  demonstrated  a  willingness  to look beyond the  formalities  of business arrangements  to determine the  underlying  purposes of payments  between health care  participants.  Although,  to our  knowledge,  neither  we  nor  any of our customers is the subject of any investigation,  we cannot tell whether we or our customers will be the target of governmental investigations in the future.        Federal and State  Anti-Kickback  Laws.   Provisions of the Social  Security Act,  which  are  commonly  known as the  Federal  Anti-Kickback  Law,  prohibit knowingly or willfully,  directly or  indirectly,  paying or offering to pay, or soliciting  or  receiving,  any  remuneration  in exchange  for the  referral of patients  to  a  person  participating  in,  or  for  the  order,   purchase  or recommendation  of items or  services  that are  subject  to  reimbursement  by, Medicare,  Medicaid  and similar  other  federal or state  healthcare  programs. Violations may result in civil and criminal  sanctions and penalties.  If any of our health care  communications or electronic commerce activities were deemed to be inconsistent with the Federal  Anti-Kickback Law or with state  anti-kickback or illegal  remuneration  laws, we could face civil and criminal penalties or be barred from such  activities.  Further,  we could be required to restructure our existing  or  planned  sponsorship  compensation   arrangements  and  electronic commerce activities in a manner that could harm our business.       If compliance with government  regulation of healthcare  becomes costly and difficult for us and our  customers,  we may not be able to grow our business as we plan, or we may have to abandon a product or service we are providing or plan to provide altogether.  Employees        As of March 15,  2002,  we had 28  full-time  and no  part-time  employees. Fifteen of these  employees are involved in software  programming and support of the Cymedix network,  7 are involved in the marketing and deployment of product, and 6 are involved in our administrative and financial  operations.  None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we have never  experienced a work stoppage.  We believe our relationship  with our employees to be good.  However, our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our  continuing  ability to attract,  integrate,  retain and  motivate highly  qualified  sales,  technical  and  managerial  personnel,  and  upon the continued  service  of  our  senior  management  and  key  sales  and  technical personnel.  See  "Executive  Officers  Compensation  -  Employment  Agreements." Competition  for such qualified  personnel in our industry and the  geographical locations of our offices is intense,  particularly  in software  development and technical personnel.   ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES        Our principal  executive office is located at 420 Lexington  Avenue,  Suite 1830, New York, NY 10170.  In addition,  we have three other offices  located in Colorado, California and Georgia.

We remain      jointly liable for rental payments on such subleased space until the end of      the  sublease  and  liable  for all the  space  until  the end of the lease      indicated above.       In addition to the properties  listed in the above table,  the Company also is liable for rental  payments  on an old lease in East  Brunswick,  New Jersey, encompassing  7888  square feet of vacant  office  space.  The  monthly  rent is approximately  $12,500,  with a  lease  termination  date  of  April  30,  2003. Management is currently  engaged in negotiations  with the landlord to terminate this agreement.       We  believe  these  facilities  will  be  suitable  for our  needs  for the foreseeable future. We have insured all of our properties at the levels required to meet our lease  obligations.  We  believe  that these  levels are  reasonable measures of adequate levels of insurance.   ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS        On August 7, 2001, a former  officer of the Company  filed an action in the District Court of Arapahoe County, Colorado,  against the Company and its former President and CEO, John Yeros,  entitled   Barry J. McDonald v. Medix  Resources, Inc f/k/a/  International  Nursing  Services,  Inc.  and John  Yeros ,  (Case No. 01CV2119).  The plaintiff alleges (1) breach of an employment agreement, a stock option  agreement and the related  stock option plan,  (2) breach of the duty of good faith and fair  dealing,  and (3) violation of the Colorado Wage Claim Act. Plaintiff seeks  unspecified  damages to be determined at jury trial,  including interest, punitive damages,  plaintiff's attorneys fees, and a 50% penalty under the Colorado Wage Claim Act. The Company's  and its  co-defendant  have answered the plaintiff's complaint, denying any liability. The Court has set discovery to be  completed  by July 31,  2002,  and the trial to begin on  September 9, 2002. Management of the Company intends to vigorously  defend this action and does not expect any  resolution of this matter to have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.       On December 17, 2001,  Plaintiff,  Vision  Management  Consulting,  L.L.C., filed suit against us in the Superior Court of New Jersey,  Law Division - Essex County, entitled  Vision Management Consulting,  L.L.C v. Medix Resources,  Inc. , Docket No.  ESX-L-11438-01.  The complaint  alleges  breach of contract,  unjust enrichment,   breach  of  the  duty  of  good   faith  and  fair   dealing   and misrepresentations  by us in connection with a negotiated  settlement agreement, which  had  resulted  from  claims  between  the  parties  arising  out  of  the termination of operations by our Automated  Design Concepts  division earlier in 2001.  Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages to be proven at jury trial,  together with attorneys fees, costs of suit and interest on the judgment, as well as such further  relief as the Court  deems just and  equitable.  We have  answered  the plaintiff's  complaint,  denying any liability and setting forth a  counterclaim seeking the award to us of our costs of  defending  this action and such further relief as the Court  deems just and  proper.  Management  intends to  vigorously defend this action and does not expect any  resolution  of this matter to have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  results of  operations or financial condition.  The Court has appointed a mediator for the case to try to facilitate a settlement between the parties.       From time to time,  the Company is involved in claims and  litigation  that arise out of the normal course of business.  Currently,  other than as discussed above,  there are no pending  matters  that in  Management's  judgment  might be considered  potentially  material to us. Management does not believe that any of the  litigation  described  above  will have a  material  adverse  effect on the Company.  ITEM 4.

The number of record  holders  includes  shareholders  who may hold  stock for the  benefit of others.       We do  not  expect  to  pay  any  dividends  on  its  common  stock  in the foreseeable future.  Management  currently intends to retain all available funds for the development of its business and for use as working capital.  The payment of dividends on the common stock is subject to our prior  payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends on any preferred stock outstanding.   ITEM 6.

MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION   Overview        We are an information  technology  company  headquartered in New York City, with  offices in Agoura  Hills,  California,  Greenwood  Village,  Colorado  and Marietta, Georgia. We specialize in the development, marketing and management of software and  connectivity  solutions  for  clinical  and business  transactions within the healthcare industry Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Cymedix Lynx Corporation,  a Colorado  corporation,  we have developed  Cymedix(R),  a unique healthcare  communication  technology  product.  Created by a team of healthcare professionals, Cymedix software provides healthcare institutions, such as health plans, insurers and hospitals,  as well as practicing physicians,  with a set of non-invasive  technology tools to enable Internet-based health care transactions among all parties.       Implementation  of the Cymedix software suite promises to speed and improve the efficacy of daily  interactions  between health caregivers and their staffs, other ancillary providers (such as labs or pharmacy benefit managers), insurance companies,  hospitals, Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and Health Management Organizations  (HMOs).  We believe  that the  market  for  robust and  practical healthcare solutions will grow rapidly, and that segment growth will continue to accelerate as the joined emphases of consumer  choice,  quality,  administrative service  and cost  containment  ratchets up demand for ever more  efficient  and user-friendly methods of delivering quality healthcare.  Forward-Looking Statements and Associated Risks        This  Report  contains  forward-looking  statements,  which  mean that such statements  relate to events or  transactions  that have not yet  occurred,  our expectations  or estimates for our future  operations and economic  performance, our  growth  strategies  or  business  plans or other  events  that have not yet occurred.  Such  statements  can be  identified  by the  use of  forward-looking terminology  such as "might," "may," "will,"  "could,"  "expect,"  "anticipate," "estimate,"  "likely," "believe," or "continue" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable  terminology.  The following paragraphs contain discussions  of  important  factors  that should be  considered  by  prospective investors for their potential impact on forward-looking  statements  included in this Report. These important factors,  among others, may cause actual results to differ  materially  and adversely  from the results  expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.       We  have   reported  net  losses  of   ($10,636,000),   ($5,415,000),   and ($4,847,000)  for the years  ended  December  31,  2001,  December  31, 2000 and December 31, 1999,  respectively.  At December 31, 2001,  we had an  accumulated deficit of  ($33,412,000),  and negative working capital of ($1,404,000).  These factors  and other  concerns  have  caused our  accountants  to include a "going concern"  exception  in their  report  in  connection  with  their  audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2001.       We expect to continue to experience  losses,  in the near term,  until such time  as our  Cymedix(R)software  products  can be  successfully  deployed  with customers  and produce  revenue.  The current  operation of our business and our ability to continue to develop and market our  Cymedix  software  products  will depend upon our ability to obtain additional  financing.  At present, we are not receiving  any  significant  revenues  from  the  sale of our  Cymedix  software products.  We are  attempting  to meet our  current  cash flow  needs by raising capital in the private  debt and equity  markets  and  through  the  exercise of currently  outstanding  warrants.  The  development and marketing of the Cymedix software  products  require  substantial  capital  investments.  There can be no assurance that  additional  investments or financings will be available to us as needed to support the  development of Cymedix  products.  Failure to obtain such capital on a timely basis could result in lost business opportunities,  the sale of the Cymedix  business at a distressed  price or the financial  failure of our company.       We  have  recently  entered  into  a  secured  financing  arrangement.  See "BUSINESS - Recent  Developments." The use of secured  borrowings  increases the risk of loss of the assets used to secure the borrowing.  If an event of default occurs under the security agreement, the lender will be able to foreclose on the assets used to secure the borrowing and sell those assets to the highest bidder. In  addition,  it is  generally  believed  that  foreclosure  sales,  which  are "distress  sales",  will not maximize the proceeds  that are paid for the assets being  sold.  The loan we  entered  into is  secured  by the grant of a security interest in all Medix's intellectual property,  including its patent, copyrights and trademarks.  While Medix can cure a payment default by the forced conversion of the loan into its common stock, a bankruptcy or similar event of default will trigger the foreclosure provision of the security agreement.       We are still in the process of gaining  experience  in  marketing  software products,  providing software support services,  evaluating demand for products, financing a software business and dealing with government regulation of software products.  While we are putting together a team of experienced executives,  they have come from  different  backgrounds  and may require  some time to develop an efficient  operating structure and corporate culture for our company. We believe our structure of multiple offices serves our customers well, but it does present an  additional  challenge  in  building  our  corporate  culture  and  operating structure.       Our products are in the integration and deployment  stages, and have proven their  effectiveness  with some sponsors.  We have not yet proven our technology with a significant number of physicians. As a developer of software products, we will be required to anticipate and adapt to evolving industry  standards and new technological   developments.   The  market  for  our   software   products   is characterized by continued and rapid technological advances in both hardware and software   development,   requiring   ongoing   expenditures  for  research  and development,  and  timely  introduction  of new  products  and  enhancements  to existing products.  The establishment of standards is largely a function of user acceptance. Therefore, such standards are subject to change. Our future success, if any, will depend in part upon our ability to enhance  existing  products,  to respond  effectively  to technology  changes,  and to introduce new products and technologies  to meet  the  evolving  needs  of its  clients  in the  healthcare information systems market.       The  success of our  products  and  services in  generating  revenue may be subject to the quality and completeness of the data that is generated and stored by  the  physician  or  other  healthcare  professional  and  entered  into  our interconnectivity  systems,  including  the  failure  to  input  appropriate  or accurate information. Failure or unwillingness by the healthcare professional to accommodate the required information quality may result in the payor refusing to pay Medix for its services.       The  introduction of software  products in that market has been slow due to the large number of small  practitioners who are resistant to change, as well as the  financial  investment  or workflow  interruptions  associated  with change, particularly  in a period of rising  pressure to reduce costs in the market.  We are currently devoting significant resources toward the development of products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully  complete the development of these products in a timely  fashion or that our current or future  products will satisfy the needs of the healthcare  information systems market.  Further, there can be no assurance that products or  technologies  developed by others will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete.       Certain  of our  products  provide  applications  that  relate  to  patient medication histories and treatment plans. Any failure by our products to provide accurate, secure and timely information could result in product liability claims against us by our clients or their affiliates or patients. We maintain insurance that we believe  currently is adequate to protect against claims associated with the use of our  products,  but  there  can be no  assurance  that our  insurance coverage would  adequately  cover any claim  asserted  against us. The limits of that coverage is $2,000,000 in the aggregate and  $1,000,000 per  occurrence.  A successful  claim brought  against us in excess of our insurance  coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.  Even unsuccessful  claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation, as well as diversion of management time and resources.       We have been granted  certain  patent  rights,  trademarks  and  copyrights relating to its software  business.  However,  patent and intellectual  property legal issues for software  programs,  such as the Cymedix products,  are complex and currently  evolving.  Since patent applications are secret until patents are issued,  in the United States,  or published,  in other countries,  we cannot be sure that we are first to file any patent application. In addition, there can be no assurance that competitors,  many of which have far greater resources than we do, will not apply for and obtain  patents that will  interfere with our ability to develop or market product ideas that we have originated. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the protection to intellectual property that is provided in the United  States,  and may limit our ability to market our products overseas.  We cannot give any assurance that the scope of the rights we have are broad enough to fully protect our Cymedix software from infringement.       Litigation  or  regulatory  proceedings  may be  necessary  to protect  our intellectual  property  rights,  such as the scope of our patent.  In fact,  the computer   software   industry  in  general  is   characterized  by  substantial litigation.  Such  litigation and regulatory  proceedings are very expensive and could be a significant  drain on our resources and divert resources from product development.  There is no assurance that we will have the financial resources to defend our patent rights or other  intellectual  property from  infringement  or claims of  invalidity.  We have been  notified by a party that it  believes  our pharmacy  product may infringe on patents that it holds. We have retained patent counsel who has made a preliminary investigation and determined that our product does not infringe on the  identified  patents.  At this time no legal action has been instituted.       We also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology and no assurance can be given  that  others  will not  independently  develop  substantially  equivalent proprietary  information  and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our  proprietary  technology or that we can  meaningfully  protect our rights in such unpatented proprietary technology.  We will use our best efforts to protect such  information and techniques,  however,  no assurance can be given that such efforts will be  successful.  The failure to protect our  intellectual  property could cause us to lose  substantial  revenues and to fail to reach our financial potential over the long term.       The healthcare and medical  services  industry in the United States is in a period  of  rapid  change  and  uncertainty.  Governmental  programs  have  been proposed,  and some adopted, from time to time, to reform various aspects of the U.S.  healthcare  delivery system.  Some of these programs contain  proposals to increase  government  involvement in healthcare,  lower  reimbursement rates and otherwise  change the operating  environment  for our  customers.  Particularly, HIPAA and the regulations that are being promulgated  thereunder are causing the healthcare industry to change its procedures and incur substantial cost in doing so.  Although  we expect  these  regulations  to have the  beneficial  effect of spurring adoption of our software products, we cannot predict with any certainty what  impact,  if any,  these and future  healthcare  reforms  might have on our software business. See "BUSINESS - Governmental Regulation."       In connection with our equity line of credit financing,  we have registered 9,500,000  additional  shares  with  the SEC for  sale by the  providers  of the financing,  of which 5,031,371  shares remain available for issuance as of March 15,  2002.  The  resale of the  common  stock that may be issued by us under the equity line of credit will  substantially  increase  the number of our  publicly traded shares ("float").  If existing  shareholders perceive that this increased float is not  accompanied  by a  commensurate  increase in value to the Company, then shareholder  value--real or perceived--will be diluted. Such dilution could cause holders of our shares of common stock to sell,  thus  depressing the price of our common stock. Therefore,  the very existence of the equity line financing could depress the market price of our common stock.       The resale of the  common  stock that will be issued by us under our equity line of credit financing could depress the market price of our common stock. The terms of the equity line provide that we will sell shares of our common stock to the  providers of the financing at 91% of the average of the three lowest of the daily  volume-weighted  average prices of our common stock during the 22-trading day period immediately before our request for the advance.  Therefore, since all of the shares that are issued by us in connection with advances under the equity line  financing  will have a "built-in"  discount of at least 9% upon  issuance, this could  produce an impetus  for the  providers  of the equity line to resell their  shares  sooner or in greater  quantity  than they would  otherwise.  Such resale could have the effect of  depressing  our share price.  At March 15, 2002 the Company had issued  2,748,552  shares to the equity line  providers,  all of which has been sold into the  public  market.  Trading  activity  related to the liquidation of these shares shown little  correlation  to downward  movements in share price.       As of March 15, 2002, we had 58,386,516 shares of common stock outstanding. As of that date, approximately 24,117,525 shares were issuable upon the exercise of  outstanding  options,  warrants  or  other  rights,  and the  conversion  of preferred stock. Most of these shares will be immediately saleable upon exercise or  conversion  under  registration  statements  we have filed with the SEC. The exercise  prices of options,  warrants or other  rights to acquire  common stock presently  outstanding range from $0.19 per share to $4.97 per share. During the respective terms of the outstanding options, warrants, preferred stock and other outstanding  derivative  securities,  the holders are given the  opportunity  to profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock,  and the exercise of any options, warrants or other rights may dilute the book value per share of the common stock and put  downward  pressure on the price of the common  stock.  The existence of the options,  conversion  rights,  or any outstanding  warrants may adversely affect the terms on which we may obtain  additional  equity financing. Moreover,  the holders of such securities are likely to exercise their rights to acquire common stock at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain capital on terms  more  favorable  than  could  be  obtained  through  the  exercise  or conversion of such securities.  See also the impact of our equity line of credit financing discussed in the following paragraphs.       As with any business,  growth in absolute  amounts of selling,  general and administrative  expenses or the occurrence of  extraordinary  events could cause actual results to vary materially and adversely from the results contemplated by the  forward-looking  statements.  Budgeting and other management  decisions are subjective  in many  respects and thus  susceptible  to incorrect  decisions and periodic   revisions   based  on  actual   experience   and  external   business developments,  the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing,  capital expenditures  or other  budgets,  which  may,  in turn,  affect  our  results of operation.  Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic,  competitive and market conditions, and future business  decisions,  all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately  and many of which are beyond our  control.  Although  we believe the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions  could prove  inaccurate,  and therefore,  there can be no assurance that  the  results  contemplated  in  the  forward-looking  statements  will  be realized.       In light of the significant  uncertainties  inherent in the forward-looking information  included herein,  the inclusion of such  information  should not be regarded as a  representation  by us or any other person that our  objectives or plans for the Company will be achieved.  Results of Operation   Comparison of years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000        Total revenues  decreased  approximately  $297,000 from $326,000 in 2000 to $29,000 in 2001. The decrease is due to a decrease in Cymedix pilot program fees billed  during 2001 of $189,000,  and a decrease in ADC revenue of $108,000 as a result of discontinuing that business segment.       Direct costs of services increased  approximately  $33,000 from $180,000 in 2000 to $213,000 in 2000.  The increase is due to  amortization  of  capitalized software development costs related to Cymedix.       Software  development  costs increased  approximately  57% from $685,000 in 2000 to  $1,075,000  in 2000,  as a  result  of costs  incurred  in the  ongoing development of the Cymedix product line.       Selling,  general and administrative  expenses  decreased  approximately 3% from $5,925,000 in 2000 to $5,746,000 in 2001. The decrease is attributable to a company wide salary reduction program that was undertaken early in 2001.       During  2001,  the  Company  recorded   impairment  expense  of  $1,111,000 resulting from the  discontinuance  of its Automated  Design  Concepts  division which  totaled  $443,000,  to focus staff  resources  on the  Company's  primary technology,  and  the  cancellation  of its  Zirmed  license  totaling  $668,000 agreement which was a result of management's assessment that the Company's needs would be better served by superior technology.       Other  income  decreased  approximately  $151,000  from 2000 to 2001.  This increase  reflects a decline in  interest  income that had been earned on excess cash  received  and  invested  during  2000 from the  exercise  of  options  and warrants.       Interest expense  increased  $61,000 from 2000 to 2001 due to interest that was paid on a convertible promissory note issued during 2001.       Financing  costs of $2,428,000 were incurred in 2001 due to warrants issued and an in-the money  conversion  feature in connection with the convertible debt credit  facility of $581,000,  a warrant issued in the private equity  placement valued at  $113,000,  and shares  issued in the  conversion  of debt and related equity  share  issuances  at below  market  prices  which  resulted  in costs of $1,734,000.       Net  gain  (loss)  from  discontinued  operations  decreased  approximately $929,000  from $929,000 in 2000 to $0 in 2001,  due to the sale during  February 2000 of the remaining assets of the company's staffing operations.       Net loss  increased  approximately  $5,221,000  from  $5,415,000 in 2000 to $10,636,000 in 2001 due to the reasons discussed above.  Comparison of years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999        Total  revenues  increased  approximately  $302,000 from $24,000 in 1999 to $326,000 in 2000.  The  increase  is due to Cymedix  pilot  program  fees billed during  2000,  and ADC  revenue  from the date of  acquisition  (March 8,  2000) through December 31, 2000.       Direct costs of services  increased  approximately  $178,000 from $2,000 in 1999 to $180,000 in 2000.  The increase is due to  amortization  of  capitalized software  development  costs  related to Cymedix of  $124,000,  as well as costs associated  with ADC revenue of $16,000,  from the period  March 8, 2000 through December 31, 2000.       Software  development  costs increased  approximately  15% from $596,000 in 1999 to  $685,000  in  2000,  as a  result  of  costs  incurred  in the  ongoing development  of the Cymedix  product line.  During the third quarter of 2000 the company began capitalizing and amortizing software development costs.       Selling,  general and administrative  expenses increased  approximately 57% from  $3,777,000 in 1999 to $5,925,000 in 2000. The increase is due primarily to an increase in executive  management and operational salaries and benefits as of $1,088,000,  as well as  consulting  fees  related to employee  recruitment  and placement of $272,000, and legal, accounting and advisory services of $248,000.       Net loss from operations increased approximately $2,113,000 from $4,351,000 in 1999 to $6,464,000  in 2000.  This increase is primarily due to the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses described above.       Other  income  increased  approximately  $156,000  from 1999 to 2000.  This increase  reflects  interest  income on excess cash received and invested during the year from the exercise of options and warrants.       Interest expense decreased 79%, or approximately $161,000 from 1999 to 2000 due to  interest  that was paid and  imputed on a  convertible  promissory  note during 1999.       Net loss from continuing operations increased approximately $1,796,000 from $4,548,000  in 1999 to  $6,344,000  in 2000 due to all of the reasons  discussed above.       Net gain (loss) from discontinued  operations increased  approximately 411% or  $1,228,000  from  $(299,000)  in 1999 to $929,000  in 2000,  due to the sale during  February  2000  of  the  remaining  assets  of  the  company's  staffing operations.       Net  loss  increased  approximately  $568,000  from  $4,847,000  in 1999 to $5,415,000 in 2000 due to the reasons discussed above.  Liquidity and Capital Resources        We had $8,000 in cash as of December  31, 2001  compared to  $1,007,000  in cash as of December 31, 2000 and $1,229,000 as of December 31, 1999. Net working capital  was  ($1,404,000)  as of December  31, 2001  compared to $394,000 as of December 31, 2000 and $644,000 as of December  31, 1999.  During 2001,  net cash used in operating  activities  was  $5,397,000  compared to  $5,173,000 in 2000. During 2001, we raised $1,500,000 from a convertible note financing,  $1,200,000 from private placements of our common stock,  $1,510,000 from our equity line of credit and $369,000  from  exercise of options and  warrants.  During  2000,  we raised  $6,091,000  from the exercise of options and  warrants.  During 1999, we raised  $4,112,000  from private  placements of preferred  stock,  $500,000 from issuance of a convertible promissory note, and $150,000 from exercise of options and warrants.       Subsequent   to  year-end  and  through   March  15,   2002,   we  received approximately $3,800 from the exercise of options and warrants,  $1,000,000 from a  secured  convertible  note  financing,  and  $883,000  from our  equity  line financing.  As of March 15, 2002, we had  outstanding  warrants  exercisable for 5,136,000  shares of  common  stock,  exercisable  at $0.50  per  share,  with a aggregate  exercise price of $2,568,000  which are callable for $.01 per warrant upon thirty days written  notice.  However,  no  assurance  can be given that if called such warrants  would be exercised.  From time to time,  members of senior management  have  made  short-term  loans  to us to  meet  payroll  obligations. However, there is no commitment to continue that practice.       We will  continue  to have  financing  costs  charged to our  statement  of operations  in the  future  for  convertible  debt we  issue  with  in-the-money conversion features.       Currently, we are funding our development and deployment activities through an equity line of credit financing.  Draws under this financing are triggered by a "Put Notice"  (advance  request)  initiated by ourselves  each time we wish to draw funds. The financing  investors are committed to accept the advance request provided  certain  conditions  are met, some of which may be waived by agreement among the parties.  Such advance request  obligates us to issue to the investors shares  of our  common  stock  at a  discount  to  market  which is fixed in the contract.  The shares are  immediately  re-saleable in the public markets by the investors.  As of March 15, 2002, we had received  $2,584,910 in advances,  from which  offering  expenses of $191,278 was paid under the  financing,  and we had issued to the  investors  4,468,629  shares of our common stock  relating to the advances  and an  additional  542,847  shares  to their  affiliates  as fees for arranging the equity line  facility.  The shares  issued  pursuant to the equity line advances to date have been priced from $0.46 to $0.77 per share.       We expect to  continue to  experience  loses and  negative  cash flows from operations,  in the near term, until such time as we are deployed on physicians' desktops in  sufficient  numbers to cover our overhead The current  operation of our  business  and our  ability to  continue  to further  develop and deploy our Cymedix  software  products  will depend  upon our ability to obtain  additional financing.  At present,  we are not receiving any significant  revenues from the sale of our Cymedix  software  products.  We are  attempting to meet our current cash flow needs by raising  capital in the private  debt and equity  markets and through the exercise of currently  outstanding  warrants.  The  development  and marketing  of  the  Cymedix  software  products  require   substantial   capital investments.  There can be no assurance that additional funding, if needed, will be  available  on terms  acceptable  to us, or at all.  Failure  to obtain  such capital on a timely basis could result in lost business opportunities,  the sale of the Cymedix  business at a distressed  price or the financial  failure of our company.
