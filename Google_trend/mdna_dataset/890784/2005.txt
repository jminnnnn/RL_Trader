ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview        We develop and market healthcare connectivity software centered around the CarePoint Suite of healthcare  communication  technology products for electronic prescribing,  laboratory orders and results, Internet-based communication,  data integration and transaction  processing through a handheld device or browser, at the patient  point of care.  Our products  enable  communication  of  healthcare information among physicians' offices, pharmacies,  hospitals,  pharmacy benefit managers, health management  organizations,  pharmaceutical companies and health insurance companies.  In addition,  our CareGiver application provides long term care  facilities  with a  comprehensive  solution for  wireless  order entry and fulfillment of  medications,  treatments,  equipment and supplies;  resident and facility administration; electronic charting; administrative process automation; and electronic  integration  with  institutional  pharmacies,  billing  systems, pharmacists,  and other vendors. Our technology is designed to provide access to safer,  better  healthcare and more accurate and less expensive POC  information gathering and processing.  Critical Accounting Policies  Critical Accounting Policies and Items Affecting Comparability        Quality  financial  reporting  relies  on  consistent  application  of our accounting policies that are based on accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States.  The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to  understanding  our  financial  statements  and often  require management   judgment  and  estimates  regarding  matters  that  are  inherently uncertain.  Revenue Recognition        We account for our revenue  under the  provisions of Statement of Position 97-2,  "Software Revenue  Recognition," as amended by Statement of Position 98-9 "Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions".  We derive our  revenues  from  three  primary  sources:  license revenues,  comprised of fees  associated  with the  licensing of our software to physicians and long term care facilities; service revenues, from maintenance and consulting  and training  services;  and revenues  from sales to  pharmaceutical companies and other partners.  Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of such an  arrangement,  the  product has been  delivered,  the fee is fixed or determinable  and the  collection  of the  resulting  receivable  is  reasonably assured.  If any of these  criteria  are not met, we defer  revenue  recognition until  such time as all  criteria  are met.  Payments  received  in  advance  of revenues  being  recognized  are  presented  as  deferred  revenue  will  not be recognized until it is earned and due under the terms of the agreement.        In October  2004,  the  Company  purchased  the  business  assets of Berdy Medical Systems,  Inc., a company that develops,  markets and licenses  computer software and hardware for use in physician practices.  Software license revenues and system (third party computer  hardware)  sales are recognized upon execution of the sales  contract  and  delivery of the software  and/or  hardware.  In all cases, however, the fee must be fixed or determinable, collection of any related receivable  must  be  considered  probable,  and  no  significant  post-contract obligations of the Company shall be remaining.  Otherwise,  the sale is deferred until all of the  requirements  for  revenue  recognition  have been  satisfied. Maintenance fees for routine client support and unspecified  product updates are recognized  ratably  over the  term of the  maintenance  arrangement.  Training, implementation  and EDI  services  revenues are  recognized  as the services are performed.                                          33   Software and Technology Costs        Technological  feasibility  for our software is reached shortly before the products  are  released   commercially.   Costs  incurred  after   technological feasibility is established are not material,  and,  accordingly,  we expense all software and technology costs when incurred.  Purchase Accounting Valuations        As required under generally accepted accounting  principles,  when we make acquisitions  such as the assets and  businesses  of Frontline in 2003 and Berdy Medical  Systems in 2004 we make  estimates  of the fair value of  tangible  and intangible  assets acquired and liabilities  assumed.  The determination of fair value  requires  significant  judgments and  estimates  that affect the carrying value of our assets and  liabilities.  Periodically,  we evaluate our estimates, including  those related to the carrying  value of tangible  assets,  long-lived assets,  capitalized  costs and  accruals.  We base our  estimates on historical experience  and on various  other  assumptions  that we believe are  reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates  under  different  assumptions or conditions and as circumstances change.  Goodwill        Goodwill  represents  acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible  assets of businesses  purchased.  In conjunction  with our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible   Assets  ("SFAS  142"),  we  evaluate  our  goodwill   annually  for impairment,  or  earlier  if  indicators  of  potential  impairment  exist.  The determination of whether or not goodwill or other intangible  assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions  underlying the approach used to determine the value of the reporting units.  Changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require  adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible  assets. We will continue to  evaluate  our  goodwill  for  impairment  on an  annual  basis or  sooner if indicators of potential impairment exist.  Long-lived Assets        With the exception of goodwill,  long-lived  assets,  such as property and equipment and other  intangible  assets,  net, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be  recoverable.  An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated  undiscounted  future  cash flows  expected  to result from the use of these assets and their eventual  disposition is less than their carrying amount. Impairment,  if any, is assessed using  discounted  cash flows.  During the year ended  December 31, 2004,  we recognized  impairment  losses on our fixed assets (furniture,  equipment and leasehold improvements) totaling $314,000 relating to suspending  operations of our subsidiary LifeRamp Family Financial,  Inc. in the third quarter and the closing of our Florida office.  Contingencies        We are subject to legal proceedings,  lawsuits and other claims related to labor,  service and other  matters.  We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse  judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential  ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required,  if any, for these  contingencies  are made after  careful  analysis  of each  individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach,  such as a change in settlement  strategy in dealing with these matters.  See Item 3 "Legal Proceedings" and the footnotes to the financial statements for further information.                                          34   Equity Transactions        In  many  of  our  financing  transactions,  warrants  have  been  issued. Additionally,  we issue options and warrants to non-employees  from time to time as payment for services.  In all of these cases, we apply the principles of SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-based  Compensation" to value these awards,  which inherently  include a number of estimates and assumptions  including stock price volatility  factors.  In  addition  to interest  expense,  the  Company  records financing and certain offering costs associated with its capital raising efforts in its statements of operations.  These include amortization of debt issue costs such as cash,  warrants  and other  securities  issued to finders and  placement agents,  and  amortization of debt discount  created by in-the-money  conversion features on convertible  debt accounted for in accordance  with Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 98-5,  "Accounting  for  Convertible  Securities  with Beneficial  Conversion Features or Contingently  Adjustable  Conversion Ratios," and Issue 00-27, "Application of Issue 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments," by other securities issued in connection with debt as a result of allocating the proceeds  amongst the securities in accordance with Accounting  Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 14,  "Accounting  for Convertible  Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants",  based on their relative fair values, and by any value associated  with  inducements  to convert debt in  accordance  with SFAS No. 84, "Induced   Conversions  of  Convertible   Debt".  We  based  our  estimates  and assumptions on the best information available at the time of valuation, however, changes in these estimates and  assumptions  could have a material effect on the valuation of the underlying instruments.  Results of Operations  Comparison of years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003.  Revenues.  Total revenues for 2004 increased to $264,000, or 38%, as compared to $191,000  in 2003.  Approximately  $162,000 of the 2004 amount was earned from a distribution  partner in  connection  with  marketing  our product to a targeted group of physicians  pursuant to an agreement,  the initial phase of which ended in August 2004. An additional  $144,000 of revenue from this partner is included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2004 and is expected to be earned in 2005 as our software is deployed. In addition, revenues in 2004 include approximately $42,000  relating  primarily to the fulfillment of the deferred revenue of Berdy Medical  Systems upon  acquisition  in October  2004.  Our revenues in 2003 were earned in connection  with prior software  customization  agreements  with third parties.  Operating  Expenses.  Total  operating  expenses  for 2004 were  $27.6  million, compared to $17.4 million for 2003, an increase of $10.2 million.         In June and September  2004, the Company  implemented a reduction in work force  and  salary  reduction  program,  pursuant  to  which  73  employees  and consultants were terminated and, with respect to the June 2004 reduction in work force, some of the remaining employees and consultants agreed to accept,  during the  six-month  period  ending  November 30, 2004, in lieu of a portion of their base salaries, a retention bonus equal to an individually negotiated multiple of the  amount of their  reduction  in pay in the form of  shares of common  stock, payable only if they  remained  employed  with the Company on November 30, 2004. Included in  operating  expenses  for year ended  December 31, 2004 are non-cash expenses of $687,000 relating to this retention bonus program.                                          35         In  November  2004 the  Company's  stockholders  approved  the 2005  Stock Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan"), which provides for issuance of common stock of up to 5,500,000  shares to the Company's  employees,  consultants  and directors through  restricted  stock awards or reserved  for the  exercise of options.  In order to retain its employees the Company awarded restricted stock to all of the then current  employees that did not  participate in the above  retention  bonus program.  Those employees who  participated in the above retention bonus program were given the choice of receiving said bonus or  relinquishing it in return for the  restricted  stock  award.  Substantially  all  these  employees  agreed  to relinquish their rights to the above retention bonus in return for the new award of restricted  shares of the Company's common stock. A total of 3,449,248 shares of Common Stock were approved for issuance of restricted  stock to the Company's employees  which vest  generally as to 40% on January 1, 2005 and the  remainder vesting  in eight  equal  quarterly  installments  commencing  on April 1, 2005. Included in  operating  expenses  for year ended  December 31, 2004 are non-cash compensation  expenses of  approximately  $2 million relating to this restricted stock program.        Software and technology  costs  increased $3.6 million,  or 131%, from the prior year,  to $6.4  million.  The increase is due to the growth in  personnel, including  $888,000  relating to the six month  retention  bonus and  restricted stock award  programs that  commenced in June and November  2004,  respectively, approximately  $700,000  attributable to our  engineering and quality  assurance groups,  which were  formed in  December  2003 and the  second  quarter of 2004, respectively,  $800,000  relating to higher consulting and travel related costs, $1.1  million  relating  to  technology  and  communication  costs and  $200,000 relating to depreciation  and  amortization  of technology and other  intangible assets.        Selling,  general and administrative  expenses increased $607 million,  or 46%,  from the prior year,  to $22.4  million.  The increase  relates in part to operating  expenses  incurred  by the  Company  in the  period  relating  to the development  of  LifeRamp  of  approximately  $2.4  million as  compared to $1.0 million in 2003.  The remainder of the increase in the 2004 period over the 2003 period is attributable primarily to the following:  $1.2 million relating to the value of a warrant issued to the CEO whereby per his employment  agreement he is entitled to  purchase  up to  one-nineteenth  of the  outstanding  shares of our common  stock,  at an exercise  price of $1.14,  increased  salaries and related costs  for  sales,  marketing,   customer  care,  executive  and  administrative personnel of  approximately  $900,000,  $1.8 million  relating to the  six-month retention  bonus and restricted  stock award programs that commenced in June and November 2004,  respectively,  non-cash  compensation expenses totaling $900,000 relating to the  reduction in the value of stock  previously  issued to vendors, consultants  and  employees  for services  rendered,  $1.0  million  relating to increased  rent  and  lease  abandonment  costs;  asset  impairment  charges  of $314,000,  all  offset  in part by an  approximate  $1.8  million  reduction  in expenses incurred for travel, meals, advertising and consulting services.        Other  Income and  (Expense)  for 2004 were $(18.3  million),  compared to $(9.8 million) for the prior year, an increase of $8.5 million.  The increase is primarily  due to financing  costs  incurred in July 2004 relating to additional issuances of debt and equity  instruments in connection  with the  anti-dilutive provisions of our March 2004  financing  transactions  and debt  issuance  costs relating to the issuance of warrants  along with  convertible  promissory  notes which is being  amortized over the six month term of the notes.  In addition,  a debt  conversion  expense of  approximately  $6.7  million was  incurred in 2004 relating to the reduction in the conversion  rate of convertible  debt issued in the July 2004 financing.        Discontinued Operations.  The year ended December 31, 2004 reflects a loss from  discontinued  operations of $4.1 million relating to the sale of OnRamp on September  30,  2004 and its  operating  loss for the nine  months.  Goodwill of $3,357,000 was removed from the balance sheet as a result of the sale of OnRamp.                                          36         Dividends.   The  year  ended   December   31,   2004  was   impacted   by disproportionate   deemed  dividends  totaling  $1.0  million,   caused  by  the modification  of warrants  held by certain  warrant  holders and the issuance of additional  shares of  common  stock to  previous  investors,  to  induce  these investors to exercise their  warrants and continue to invest in future  periods. The year  ended  December  31,  2003 was  impacted  by  disproportionate  deemed dividends totaling $2.0 million        Net Loss. As a result of the above factors, the net loss applicable to our common  shareholders  for the year ended  December  31, 2004  increased to $50.8 million, as compared to $31.3 million in 2003.  Comparison of years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002.  Revenues. Total revenues for 2003 were $191,000 compared to no revenues in 2002. The  increase  was  primarily  due to the  recognition  of  $173,000 of revenues related to certain  technology  agreements,  coupled with revenue  earned from a distribution  partner in  connection  with our  product  to a targeted  group of physicians of $18,000.  Operating  Expenses.  Total  operating  expenses  for 2003 were  $17.4  million, compared to $8.6 million for 2002, an increase of $8.8 million.        Software and technology costs increased $390,000, or 16.5%, from the prior year to $2.8  million.  The increase is due to the growth in  personnel  cost of $105,000, coupled with additional costs associated with the formation of our new engineering  department of $40,000,  and the increases in consulting  and travel related costs of $88,000 and $41,000,  respectively, as well as higher technical licensing,  technology  tools and  communication  costs of  $116,000  due to the increased support of the new technology.        Selling,  general and administrative  expenses increased $8.6 million,  or 145%,  from the  prior  year to $14.5  million.  The  increase  is due to higher salaries and benefits costs of $492,000 which includes $392,000 for our expanded marketing  department  and  $100,000  spent  on  the  growing  sales  operations department  coupled  with  an  increase  of  $1.3  million  in  advertising  and promotion, including our television advertisement campaign, and increased travel related costs, and professional fees of $643,000 and $3.7 million, respectively. Additionally, executive compensation costs and board of director costs increased approximately  $2,530,000  due to increased  personnel,  coupled  with  non-cash charges related to stock option, warrants and restricted stock grants.        Terminated  Acquisition.  Costs  associated with a terminated  acquisition were  $142,000  and related to the  write-off  of expenses  associated  with the potential acquisition of PocketScripts.  Other Income and Expense        Other income  (expense)  for 2003 were $(9.8  million),  compared to $(0.4 million)  for the prior  year,  an  increase of $9.4  million.  The  increase is primarily  due to the  increased  number of various  types and levels of capital raises done during 2003.        Dividends.  As a result of the financings  mentioned  above,  the year was impacted by a  disproportionate  deemed dividend,  caused by the modification of warrants  held by  certain  warrant  holders  and  common  stock held by certain purchasers  of  our  common  stock.  Additionally,   we  recorded  a  beneficial conversion  feature  discount  related  to the  placement  of our 2003  Series A convertible  preferred stock in December 2003. The  Black-Scholes  values of the warrant  modifications  and the  intrinsic  value of the  beneficial  conversion feature of $2.0  million and $2.2  million,  respectively,  are  reflected as an increase in net loss applicable to common  stockholders and in basic and diluted loss per share.                                          37         Net Loss. As a result of the above factors, the net loss applicable to our common  shareholders  for the year ended  December  31, 2003  increased to $31.3 million, as compared to $9.0 million in 2002.  Liquidity and Capital Resources        We had $455,000 in cash as of December 31, 2004  compared to $1,806,000 in cash as of December 31, 2003. The net working capital  deficit was  ($6,306,000) as of December 31, 2004,  compared to a deficit of  ($1,098,000) at December 31, 2003.        During  2004,  net  cash  used in  operating  activities  was  $13,495,000 compared  to  $12,847,000  in 2003.  During 2004 we raised  approximately  $12.6 million of net proceeds through various private  placements of our common stock, convertible  debentures and promissory notes, together with common stock warrant and option exercises.        The Company has incurred  operating losses for the past several years, the majority of which are related to the  development  of the  Company's  healthcare connectivity  technology  and  related  marketing  efforts.  These  losses  have produced operating cash flow deficiencies,  and negative working capital,  which raise  substantial  doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company's future  operations are dependent upon  management's  ability to source additional equity capital.        The Company  expects to continue  to  experience  losses in the near term, until  such  time  that  its  technologies  can be  successfully  deployed  with physicians, clinics and skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities to produce revenues. The continuing deployment, marketing and the development of the  merged  technologies  will  depend  on  the  Company's  ability  to  obtain additional  financing.  The Company has not generated any significant revenue to date from this technology.  The Company is currently funding  operations through the sale of common stock and convertible  debt, and there are no assurances that additional  investments or financings will be available as needed to support the development and deployment of the merged technologies.  The need for the Company to obtain additional financing is acute and failure to obtain adequate financing could  result  in lost  business  opportunities,  the sale of the  Company  at a distressed price or may lead to the financial failure of the Company.        We are funding  our  operations  now  through the sale of our  securities. There can be no assurance  that  additional  investments  or financings  will be available  to  us as  needed  on  favorable  terms  or at  all  to  support  the development and deployment of the HealthRamp Technology.  Failure to obtain such capital on a timely basis could result in lost business opportunities,  the sale of the HealthRamp  Technology at a distressed price or the financial  failure of our company.  Recent Developments        On January  12,  2005,  the Company  entered  into a  securities  purchase agreement with DKR Soundshore Oasis Holding Fund Ltd.,  Harborview  Master Fund, L.P. and Platinum  Partners Value  Arbitrage Fund,  L.P., each an  institutional investor, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, and the investors agreed to purchase, 8% convertible  redeemable debentures in the aggregate amount of up to  $4,000,000  and  five-year  warrants to purchase up to  1,666,667  shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.40.  The debentures are convertible into common  stock of the Company at an initial  conversion  price of $2.40.  A first closing of  $2,000,000  occurred  on January  13,  2005 and a second  closing of $2,000,000  shall occur upon the  completion of certain  closing  conditions set forth in the securities purchase  agreement.  The Company is obligated to redeem one-fifth of the principal and interest  amount on the debentures in cash or, at the  option of the  Company,  shares of common  stock,  on the first day of each month,  commencing  on the earlier of (a) May 12,  2005,  and (b) the first date following the 20th day after the effective  date of the  registration  statement registering   for  resale  the  securities   issuable  upon  conversion  of  the debentures,  and  ending  upon the full  redemption  of the  debentures.  If the Company  elects to make  redemption  payments  in shares  of common  stock,  the principal  amount is  convertible  based upon a  conversion  price  equal to the lesser of the initial conversion price or 85% of the average of the three lowest closing bid prices for the  Company's  common  stock  during the 20 trading days immediately prior to the monthly  redemption date. The Company is also obligated to pay 8% in interest on the outstanding  principal on the debentures (i) on the effective date on which the debentures are converted into shares of common stock of the Company,  (ii) on each monthly  redemption  date or (iii) on the maturity date, at the interest conversion rate.                                          38         Assuming the maximum  amount of $4,000,000  is purchased,  the Company has agreed  to issue to the  investors  additional  investment  rights  to  purchase additional  debentures  in the  aggregate  principal  amount of up to $1,320,000 along with five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 550,000  shares of the Company's  common  stock,  on the same  terms  and  conditions  as the  original debentures  and warrants.  The  debentures and warrants are subject to customary protection against dilution.        As a result of the first closing,  previously issued and outstanding notes of the Company in the aggregate principal amount of $452,000, plus interest, are automatically  convertible  into one  hundred  and twenty  percent of  principal amount of  debentures,  together with  warrants,  of the Company having the same terms and  conditions as set forth above.  In addition,  upon each closing,  the Company's  financial  advisor is entitled to receive a warrant to purchase seven percent of the shares of common  stock  issued or issuable  upon  conversion  or exercise of the debentures and warrants at an exercise price of $2.40.        On January  12,  2005,  the Company  entered  into a  securities  purchase agreement  (the  "Equity  Line  Agreement")  with each of Yokuzuna  Holdings and Harborview Master Fund, L.P., two institutional  investors,  whereby, subject to certain closing  conditions and other criteria being met, such investors  agreed to provide an equity line of credit to the Company (the "Equity Line Financing") to purchase from the Company an aggregate  amount of up to  $25,000,000  through the issuance of shares of common stock by the Company to the investors. Since at least one of the investors  which is a party to the Equity Line  Agreement  also owns Convertible  debentures issued by the company with a fluctuating conversion or redemption  price, the investor could  potentially  affect the terms on which the investor  could  purchase the shares of common stock  underlying  the Equity Line Financing  through  conversion or redemption of Convertible  debentures and the sale of shares of common stock acquired  following  conversion or redemption of the  Convertible  debentures  into the  public  marketplace.  Therefore,  the investor is considered not to be irrevocably  bound to purchase shares of common stock and the Equity Line  Financing  does not constitute a viable means for the Company  to  obtain  capital  under  current   interpretations  of  the  federal securities laws by the SEC relating to "equity line" financing arrangements.  As a result,  the Company  will not be able to register  the shares of common stock underlying  the  Equity  Line  Financing  or draw down under the line of credit. Therefore the Company has  determined  not to seek  stockholder  approval of the Equity Line Financing on its definitive  proxy  statement  filed with the SEC on March 16, 2005.  Although there can be no assurances  that this will occur,  the Company may determine to seek stockholder  approval of the Equity Line Financing in the future in the event the investors who own the  Convertible  debentures no longer own any of these  securities or if a new investor  unaffiliated  with the current investors agrees to participate in the Equity Line Financing.                                          39         On  March  31,  2005,  the  Company  entered  into a  securities  purchase agreement  with Alpha Capital AG, Ellis  International  Ltd. and Double U Master Fund LP, each an institutional investor, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, and the investors agreed to purchase, 8% convertible redeemable debentures in the aggregate amount of $2,100,000 and five-year warrants to purchase 840,000 shares  of  common  stock at an  exercise  price of $1.25.  The  debentures  are convertible  into common stock of the Company at an initial  conversion price of $1.25.  A first  closing of  $1,050,000  occurred  on March 31,  2005.  A second closing of  $1,050,000  shall  occur  upon the  completion  of  certain  closing conditions  set forth in the  securities  purchase  agreement.  The  Company  is obligated  to redeem  one-fifth  of the  principal  and  interest  amount on the debentures in cash or, at the option of the Company,  shares of common stock, on the first day of each month, commencing on the earlier of (a) July 29, 2005, and (b) the  first  date  following  the 20th day after  the  effective  date of the registration  statement  registering  for resale the  securities  issuable  upon conversion  of the  debentures,  and  ending  upon  the full  redemption  of the debentures.  If the  Company  elects to make  redemption  payments  in shares of common stock, the principal amount is convertible  based upon a conversion price equal to the lesser of the initial conversion price or 85% of the average of the three  lowest  closing bid prices for the  Company's  common stock during the 20 trading days  immediately  prior to the monthly  redemption date. The Company is also  obligated  to  pay 8% in  interest  on the  outstanding  principal  on the debentures  (i) on the effective date on which the debentures are converted into shares of common stock of the Company,  (ii) on each monthly  redemption date or (iii) on the maturity date, at the interest conversion rate.        Assuming the maximum  amount of $2,100,000  is purchased,  the Company has agreed  to issue to the  investors  additional  investment  rights  to  purchase additional  debentures in the aggregate principal amount of up to $693,000 along with five year  warrants  to  purchase  an  aggregate  of 554,400  shares of the Company's  common  stock,  on the same  terms  and  conditions  as the  original debentures  and warrants.  The  debentures and warrants are subject to customary protection against dilution.  At the first closing,  the Company paid a cash fee of 3% of  the  original  purchase  price  for  liquidated  damages  owed  to the investors  under the January 12, 2005 financing  agreements.  In addition,  upon each closing,  the Company's  financial advisor is entitled to receive a warrant to purchase seven percent of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures at an exercise price of $1.25.        In  connection  with the above  transactions  and in order to  obtain  the waiver and consent of the January 12, 2005  investors,  the Company entered into an amendment to the securities purchase agreement, dated as of January 12, 2005, with DKR Soundshore  Oasis Holding Fund Ltd.,  Harborview  Master Fund, L.P. and Platinum  Partners Value Arbitrage Fund, L.P., each an  institutional  investor, pursuant to which the initial conversion price for the 8% convertible redeemable debentures in the aggregate amount of up to $4,000,000 ($2,000,000 of which were sold to the investors at the first  closing) was reduced from $2.40 to $1.25 and the exercise price of the five-year  warrants to purchase up to 1,666,667 shares of common stock was reduced from $2.40 to $1.25.  In  addition,  the  additional investment rights to purchase  additional  debentures in the aggregate principal amount of up to  $1,320,000  along  with  five  year  warrants  to  purchase  an aggregate of 550,000 shares of the Company's common stock, on the same terms and conditions  as the  original  debentures  and  warrants,  were  modified  by the amendment  to reduce  the  conversion  and  exercise  price from $2.40 to $1.25. Moreover,  the  conversion  price of  convertible  redeemable  debentures in the aggregate  principal  amount of $546,015 and the  exercise  price of warrants to purchase an aggregate  of 201,351  shares of common stock was reduced from $2.40 to $1.25. Pursuant to the amendment, if the Company does not file a registration statement  covering the underlying  shares of common stock on or before April 5, 2005,  the  original  investors  have  the  right  not to  purchase  convertible debentures and warrants otherwise required at the second closing.                                          40   Contractual Obligations        Below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2004:                                Payment Due By Period                                  (in thousands)                                           TOTALS         2005         2006         2007         2008                                        ------         ----         ----         ----         ----            Notes payable                        $  167,000   $  167,000 Convertible debt                        727,000      527,000                             $  200,000 Operating leases                      1,939,000      614,000   $  580,000      490,000      255,000 Total Contractual Obligations        $2,833,000   $1,308,000   $  580,000   $  490,000   $  455,000                                      ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------         See  Note 6 to the  financial  statements  for  details  of the  principal amounts of the notes and the debt discount associated therewith.

Attached hereto and filed as a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are our consolidated financial statements, beginning on page F-1.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements        In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),  "Share-Based  Payment" (SFAS 123R), which replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25. SFAS 123R requires all  share-based  payments to employees,  including  grants of employee stock options,  to be recognized in the financial  statements based on their fair values.  The pro forma disclosures previously  permitted  under  SFAS  123 no  longer  will  be an  alternative  to financial  statement  recognition.  For the Company,  SFAS 123R is effective for periods  beginning  after  June 15,  2005.  Early  application  of SFAS  123R is encouraged, but not required.        Public  companies are required to adopt the new standard  using a modified prospective  method and may elect to restate  prior  periods  using the modified retrospective  method.  Under the modified  prospective  method,  companies  are required  to  record  compensation  cost for new and  modified  awards  over the related vesting period of such awards prospectively and record compensation cost prospectively for the unvested portion,  at the date of adoption,  of previously issued and outstanding  awards over the remaining vesting period of such awards. No change to prior periods presented is permitted under the modified prospective method. Under the modified  retrospective method,  companies record compensation costs for prior periods  retroactively  through restatement of such periods. The Company has not yet determined the method of adoption it will use.  ITEM 7A.
