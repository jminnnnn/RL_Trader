Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results         of Operations   Overview            The Company recorded $747,247 in net income for the year ended December 31, 1997 after incurring losses in each of the two prior fiscal years. The Company's recent results of operations have been significantly affected by charge-offs related to loans outstanding to Mr. Brian Davis and affiliated entities. During the 1995 fiscal year, the Bank's aggregate outstanding loans to these entities totaled as much as $6.0 million and these entities represented the Bank's largest single group of borrowers. Included in total outstandings were loans made to various borrowers who allegedly funneled the proceeds to Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis has since pled guilty to defrauding the Bank and other financial institutions and the Bank's former Chief Lending Officer has pled guilty to accepting bribes from Mr. Davis in connection with these loans. The Board of Directors of the Bank has entered into Memoranda of Understanding with the FDIC and the Maryland Commissioner of Banking to address certain factors relating to its recent losses. See "Item 1. Business -- Memoranda of Understanding."            The Bank continues to be involved in litigation related to Mr. Davis' activities including suits by entities affiliated with Mr. Davis. See "Item 1. Business -- Legal Proceedings." Although the Company does not believe that outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on the Bank, these lawsuits have required the Company to incur considerable legal and professional fees which have significantly increased the Company's other expense. Adverse publicity related to these lawsuits is also believed to have also hurt the Bank's competitive position in its market place.            In 1995, the Company also underwent a change in management as a slate of nominees proposed by F. William Kuethe, Jr. and John E. Demyan, members of two of the Bank's founding families, defeated management's nominees in a proxy contest at the 1995 annual meeting of stockholders. Expenses related to this contest resulted in a $687,841 restructuring charge during 1995. The Bank's current management has been focused on addressing the Bank's asset quality and other operating problems and resolving the litigation in which the Bank is involved while maintaining the Bank as the locally owned and oriented community bank which it has historically been.  Forward-Looking Statements            When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words or phrases "will likely result,""are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "estimate," "project" or similar expressions are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and to advise readers that various factors, including regional and national economic conditions, unfavorable judicial decisions, substantial changes in levels of market interest rates, credit and other risks of lending and investment activities and competitive and regulatory factors could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected.            The Company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.                                          20      Comparison of Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995            General. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company reported consolidated net income of $747,247 ($0.68 per share) compared to consolidated net losses of $1,020,177 ($0.94 per share) and $1,726,748 ($1.62 per share) for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995. The increase in net income during the 1997 period was principally attributable to a lower provision for credit losses. The losses during 1996 and 1995 were primarily due to a significant increase in the provision for credit losses to $6,596,000 for 1996 and $7,925,000 for 1995. The increase resulted from provisions being made to charge - -off delinquent and non-performing loans. The collectibility of certain loans, significant in aggregate amount, became doubtful during 1996 and the Bank charged-off a significant amount of such loans. Charge-offs in 1997 amounted to $1,617,800, following the $5,468,293 charged off in 1996 and the $7,060,650 charged off in 1995.            Net Interest Income. The primary component of the Company's net income is its net interest income which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings used to fund them. Net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the Company's interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets, represents the Company's net interest margin.            Consolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $10,567,211 compared to $10,884,253 for the year ended December 31, 1996 and $11,339,137 for the year ended December 31, 1995. The decrease in net interest income for the most recent year was primarily attributable to lower interest income. Interest income fell $1,169,357 (6.27%) for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decline in interest income was attributable to continued run-off of the loan portfolio. As the Company has shifted its investment securities portfolio into repricable GNMA securities from state, county and municipals, the Company expects a reduction in the yield on its investment portfolio during 1998. Interest expense declined $852,315, or 10.98%, for the year ended December 31, 1997. The Company's earnings performance continues to be impacted by a decline in earning assets and a shift in the asset mix from loans to lower yielding investment securities. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 1997 was 5.09% compared to 5.04% for the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase in the net interest margin for fiscal 1997 was primarily due to the loss of accrued interest on loans charged off during fiscal 1996.            Consolidated net interest income decreased by $454,884 (4.0%) to $10,884,253 in 1996 from $11,339,137 in 1995. The 1996 decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits and a decrease in total interest revenues from lending activities for such period. The movement of deposits from lower yielding savings and money market accounts to higher yielding certificates of deposit resulted in an increase in the Bank's cost of deposits during 1996. In addition, loans on which accrual of interest has been discontinued amounted to $4,545,581 at December 31, 1996. Interest that would have accrued under the terms of these loans was $457,035. Interest income on loans fell $1,394,512 (9.6%) from $14,475,876 at the end of 1995 to $13,081,364 at the end of 1996, after increasing $390,234 (2.8%) during 1995. In addition to increased loan charge offs, the Bank made fewer loans during 1996 than 1995.            During 1996 and 1995, the Bank shifted investments from U.S. Treasury securities to U.S. government agency and state and municipal securities because they have offered higher yields. Interest from Federal funds sold almost doubled during 1996, increasing from $138,678 in 1995 to $261,423 in 1996 as Federal funds sold increased significantly. Significant gains in investment securities ($506,695) occurred in 1995 as a result of a restructuring of the Bank's investment securities portfolio. The gains were much smaller in 1996 after the restructuring was complete.                                          21                The following table allocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Bank's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume. Changes due to rate/volume are allocated to changes due to volume.

The incremental tax rate applied was 37.42% for 1997,     37.04% for 1996 and 38.62% for 1995 and 1994. 2  Non-accrual loans included in average balance.                                          23                 Provision for Credit Losses. During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company provided $270,000 for credit losses compared to $6,596,000 and $7,925,000 in provisions during the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995. The decrease in the provision reflects a decline in charge-off activity and a reduction in classified loans. During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $1,191,196 compared to $5,233,679 and $6,990,603 in net charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995. During fiscal year 1996, the Company provided $6,596,000 for credit losses compared to $7,925,000 in such provisions during 1995. The higher provisions during fiscal years 1996 and 1995 reflect the amount determined by the Company to be necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses to an adequate level after significant increases in loan charge-offs during these years.             Other Income. Other income decreased $502,643 (22.5%) during the year ended December 31, 1997 compared to the prior year period. The higher level of other income in 1996 reflects income from proceeds from insurance settlements in that year. The absence of such income during 1997 resulted in lower other income for the year notwithstanding improved income from other fees and commissions and higher gains on the sale of investment securities during 1997. In order to improve its interest rate sensitivity, the Bank sold $16.0 million in long-term, fixed-rate state, county and municipal securities which had been classified as available-for-sale and invested the proceeds in adjustable-rate, mortgage-backed securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"). Other income for fiscal year 1996 was $2,230,457, an increase of $326,174, or 17.1%, over fiscal year 1995. The improvement in other income reflects increased service charges on deposit accounts attributable to growth in deposits and $560,000 in proceeds from an insurance settlement with the Bank's fidelity bond company relating to the reimbursement of legal fees expended by the Bank in defending certain actions. These improvements in other income offset a decline in gains on sales of securities following a restructuring of the Bank's securities portfolio.            Other Expenses. Other expense increased by $2,573,983, or 28.5%, for the year ended December 31, 1997 primarily due to $996,161 in litigation and restructuring charges including a $284,000 accrual for a judgment rendered against the Bank in the third quarter of 1997 and a $700,000 expense incurred in connection with the settlement of certain litigation during the second quarter. In addition, the Company experienced increases in other expenses due to professional fees incurred in connection with other litigation in which the Company is involved. The Company anticipates continued high legal expenses during 1998 due to expenses associated with a proxy contest during the first quarter. Salary and employee benefit expenses increased $497,732 (12.0%) during the year ended December 31, 1996 rising from $4,137,232 in 1995 to $4,634,964 in 1996. During 1996, Bank staff was increased in the credit analysis and loan collection areas to deal with the Bank's troubled loans. Increased other expenses of the Company and its subsidiaries in 1996 primarily resulted from increased legal fees and other continuing costs of litigation. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings." The Bank has obtained insurance reimbursement for approximately $560,000 of its 1995 restructuring and litigation charges which is included in other income.            Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $315,284 compared to a tax benefit of $1,480,192 during the year ended December 31, 1996 and $1,694,444 in tax benefits for 1995. Due primarily to its holdings of tax-exempt state, county and municipal securities, the Company has recorded tax losses during the past three fiscal years. These net operating losses have been applied to prior years' earnings resulting in tax benefits in each of the periods. The Company has recently reduced its holdings of tax-exempt state, county and municipal securities and reinvested the proceeds in U.S. Government agency securities the income on which is not exempt from federal taxation. Accordingly, the Company anticipates an increase in taxable income which may reduce the availability of future tax benefits.  Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.            The Company's total assets declined to $231,899,594 at December 31, 1997 after increasing to $254,324,701 at December 31, 1996 from $246,164,736 at December 31, 1995. The reduction in assets during the year ended December 31, 1997 reflects a decline in the loan portfolio to $111,545,262 at December 31, 1997, net of allowances and unearned income, from $124,672,414 at December 31, 1996. Although the net loan portfolio had declined to                                           24      $124,672,414 at December 31, 1996 from $150,471,768 at December 31, 1995, total assets grew due to an expansion of the investment securities portfolio.            The decline in the loan portfolio during the most recent year was largely due to a decrease in commercial and industrial loans during the period. Commercial mortgage loans increased during the period while residential mortgages decreased slightly and lease financing and installment loans also decreased. The declines in the loan portfolio during fiscal years 1996 and 1995 were principally due to a decrease in construction and land development loans which had substantially increased during the preceding year but declined during the most recent fiscal years due to decreased origination activity and loan charge-offs. Commercial mortgage loans increased during 1995 and again slightly in 1996. Residential mortgages increased in 1995 but fell in 1996, as did demand and time loans. The decline in demand and time loans reflects decreased lending activity and increased charge-offs. Lease financing and installment loans decreased in both 1995 and 1996. The Bank has decided to decrease its equipment and automobile lease based lending because of the difficulties in monitoring the financial condition of the clients of lease company borrowers.            The Company's total investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity) totaled $81,858,000 at December 31, 1997, a $14,716,000 or 15.24%, decrease from $96,574,000 at December 31, 1996. The Company used the proceeds from maturing and called securities to fund deposit outflows during the period. During fiscal year 1996, the total investment securities portfolio grew by $21,975,153, or 29.46%, after growing by $14,197,134, or 23.50% during fiscal year 1995 to $74,598,847. The increases in the investment securities portfolio during fiscal years 1996 and 1995 reflects increases in deposits coupled with a decline in new lending activity and increased loan amortization primarily in the shorter term construction and land development, lease financing and installment portfolios. The Bank has allowed some run-off in the investment securities portfolio as deposits have declined during the current fiscal year.            Deposits as of December 31, 1997 totaled $207,110,000, a decrease of $25,636,000 (11.01%) for the year. Demand deposits as of December 31, 1997 totaled $47,651,000, a $1,762,000 (3.56%) decrease from $49,413,000 at December 31, 1996. NOW accounts as of December 31, 1997 totaled $20,582,000, a decrease of $2,210,000 (9.70%) for the year. Money market accounts declined by $6,334,000 (24.16%) for the year to total $19,877,000 on December 31, 1997. Savings deposits decreased by $5,131,000, or 10.65%. Meanwhile, certificates of deposit over $100,000 totaled $7,464,000 on December 31, 1997, a decrease of $1,156,000 (13.41%) from December 31, 1996. Other time deposits (made up of certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and individual retirement accounts) totaled $68,474,000 on December 31, 1997, a $9,043,000 (11.67%) decrease from December 31, 1996.            The Company experienced a $378,220, or 2%, increase in total stockholders' equity during the year ended December 31, 1997 as the increase in retained earnings resulting from net income during the period offset a decline in net unrealized appreciation on securities available for sale resulting from the disposition of certain available-for-sale securities. Operating losses during 1995 and 1996 significantly affected retained earnings which fell $1,856,647 (36.1%) during 1996 to end 1996 at $3,290,077. Surplus steadily increased, however, rising to $275,857 (4.7%) during 1996 to $6,192,900. The increase in the surplus account was primarily a result of the reinvestment of dividends pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the payment of three one-percent stock dividends in lieu of cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 1997.  Asset/Liability Management            Net interest income, the primary component of the Company's net income, arises from the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. The Company manages its assets and liabilities by coordinating the levels of and gap between interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize changes in net interest income and in the economic value of its equity despite changes in market interest rates. The Bank's Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee meets on a monthly basis to monitor compliance with the Board's objectives. Among other tools used by the Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee to monitor interest rate risk is a "gap" report which measures the dollar difference between the                                            25      amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing within a given time period. Generally, during a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap position would adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income, while, conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income.            During recent periods, the Company has maintained a negative gap position that has benefitted earnings as interest rates have fallen. In order to reduce its negative gap position, the Company has recently begun investing in mortgage-backed and other government securities which have rates that adjust to market rates. The Company also maintains a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities that can be quickly converted to more liquid assets if needed.            The following table sets forth the Bank's interest-rate sensitivity at December 31, 1997.

Mortgage-backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts are presumed to reprice at maturity. NOW savings accounts are assumed to reprice within three months although it is the Company's experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates.                                          26      Liquidity and Capital Resources            The Company currently has no business other than that of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.            The Bank's principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income, deposits from its primary market area, principal and interest payments on loans, interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities. Its principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits. Deposits are considered a primary source of funds supporting the Bank's lending and investment activities.            The Bank's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, federal funds sold and money market mutual funds. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank's operating financing and investment activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows.            Cash and cash equivalents (cash due from banks, interest -bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold), as of December 31, 1997, totaled $28,536,611, an increase of $5,858,950 (21%) from the December 31, 1996 total of $22,677,661. Most of this increase was in Federal funds sold which totaled $18,850,000 at December 31, 1997 compared to $10,175,000 at the end of 1996. The larger balance in Federal funds sold at the end of 1997 reflects a decision to increase liquid assets in order to fund January securities purchase commitments.            The Bank may draw on a $26,000,000 line of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. Borrowings under the line are secured by a lien on the Bank's residential mortgage loans. As of December 31, 1997, however, no amounts were outstanding under this line. In addition the Bank has a secured line of credit in the amount of $2.0 million from another commercial bank.  Year 2000 Planning            As the year 2000 approaches, an important business issue has emerged regarding how existing application software programs and operating systems can accommodate this date value. For many years, software applications routinely conserved magnetic storage space by using only two digits to record calendar years; for example, the year 1999 is stored as "99". On January 1, 2000, the calendars in many software applications will change from "99" to "00". Many of these software applications, in their current form, will produce erroneous results or will fail to run at all since their logic cannot deal with this transaction.            The Company's mainframe computer hardware and systems software are Year 2000 compliant. The Company primarily utilizes third-party vendor application software for all computer applications. The third-party vendors for the Company's banking applications are in the process of modifying, upgrading or replacing their computer applications to insure Year 2000 compliance. In addition, the Company has instituted a Year 2000 compliance program whereby the Company is reviewing the Year 2000 compliance issues that may be faced by its third-party vendors. Under such program, the Company will examine the need for modifications or replacement of all non-Year 2000 compliant pieces of software. The Company does not currently expect that the cost of its Year 2000 compliance program will be material to its financial conditions and believes that it will satisfy such compliance program by the end of 1998 without material disruption of its operations. In the event that the Company's significant suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve Year 2000 compliance, the Company's business of operations could be adversely affected.                                          27      Recently Adopted Accounting Standards            In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 128, "Earnings Per Share." This Statement establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share (EPS) and applies to entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock. This Statement simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share previously found in APB Opinion No. 15, "Earnings Per Share," and makes them comparable to international EPS standards. It replaces the presentation of primary EPS with a presentation of basic EPS. It also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after December 15, 1997, including interim periods; earlier application is not permitted. This Statement requires restatement of all prior-period EPS data presented. The adoption of this pronouncement did not impact any previously reported earnings per share information.            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of (SFAS No. 121), requires that certain long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the sum of expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset and its face value. An impairment loss is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. The Bank adopted this pronouncement in 1996, and there are no other asset impairment adjustments reflected in the 1997 and 1996 consolidated financial statements, except those assets classified as Other Real Estate Owned (OREO).            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 122, Accounting for Mortgage Servicing Rights (SFAS No. 122), requires that rights to serviced mortgage loans be recognized as an intangible asset when the underlying loans are sold and servicing rights related to these loans are retained. The standard also requires that capitalized mortgage servicing rights be assessed for impairment based on the fair value of such rights. The Bank adopted this pronouncements in 1996, and there were no loans sold for which it had maintained servicing rights. Accordingly, adoption of this pronouncement has no effect on the 1997 and 1996 consolidated financial statements.            Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income (SFAS No. 130), establishes additional standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive income" and its components of the Company's financial statements. Adoption of this pronouncement will be effective for 1998 and the Company would be reporting its net change in unrealized appreciation on securities available for sale as other comprehensive income and total net unrealized appreciation on securities available for sale reflected in stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income.            Comprehensive income, as determined under SFAS No. 130 for 1997, 1996 and 1995 would be as follows:                                                                        1997            1996             1995                                                               ------------    --------------  -------------                         Net income (loss)                               $    747,247    $  (1,020,177)  $ (1,726,748)               Net change in unrealized appreciation                  on available for sale securities                  (39,873)        (480,431)       754,435                                                               ------------    -------------   ------------                Comprehensive income (loss)                     $    707,374    $  (1,500,608)  $   (972,313)                                                               ============    =============   ============                                           28      Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices                The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company's assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.   Item 7A.
