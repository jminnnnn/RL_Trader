ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND - ------------------------------------------------------------------------          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS          ---------------------  OVERVIEW           1999 marked the Company's third straight year of higher earnings as many favorable operating trends continued. Most notably, 1999 saw a significant reduction in non-interest expense as the Company resolved the litigation which had required the Company to incur high expenses from professional fees and litigation charges in prior years. The Bank's net interest income improved due to a combination of continued loan growth and a moderation in deposit costs. Loan portfolio growth was due primarily to the Bank's indirect automobile lending which was begun in 1998 and has grown to a $51.0 million portfolio by the end of 1999. Asset quality continued to improve as non-performing loans declined both in dollar terms and as a percentage of the portfolio. Loan charge-offs were reduced significantly as a result of the Bank's improved collections procedures. Earnings for 1999 also benefitted from a one-time gain of approximately $483,000 (after applicable income and excise taxes and net of a 25% safe harbor contribution) resulting from the curtailment of the Bank's defined benefit pension plan.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS           When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words or phrases "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "estimate," "project" or similar expressions are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and to advise readers that various factors, including regional and national economic conditions, unfavorable judicial decisions, substantial changes in levels of market interest rates, credit and other risks of lending and investment activities and competitive and regulatory factors could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected.           The Company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.  COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997           GENERAL. For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company reported consolidated net income of $1,445,350 ($1.15 basic and diluted earnings per share) compared to a consolidated net profit of $833,192 ($0.66 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 1998 and a consolidated net profit of $747,247 ($0.59 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase in net income during the 1999 period was principally attributable to a $1,954,790 reduction in other expenses due mainly to the absence of litigation charges and a reduction in professional fees. During the 1998 period, the Company incurred $1,225,003 in litigation charges. The reduced level of other expenses during 1999 was partially offset by an $800,000 increase in the provision for loan losses from a net recapture into income of $500,000 in 1998 to a provision of $300,000 in 1999. Other income also declined by $294,488 from $3,122,369 in 1998 to $2,827,881 in 1999 due mainly to net losses of $63,968 on sales of investment securities in 1999 as compared to net gains of $527,320 in 1998. Other income for 1999 included a one-time curtailment gain of $1,311,997 on the termination of the Bank's pension plan. In connection with the curtailment of the pension plan, the Bank accrued a 25% safe harbor contribution of $328,000 included in employee benefit expense and federal and state excise and income taxes of approximately $304,000, resulting in a net curtailment gain of approximately $483,000. The increase in net income during the 1998 period as compared to 1997 was principally attributable to the receipt of $1,126,077 in proceeds from insurance settlements during the year and the recapture into income of $500,000 in allowances for credit losses. These increases in income offset a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non-interest expense which included amounts paid in settlement of various litigation.                                          22               NET INTEREST INCOME. The primary component of the Company's net income is its net interest income which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund them. Net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the Company's interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets, represents the Company's net interest margin.           Consolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $9,925,203 compared to $9,793,550 for the year ended December 31, 1998 and $10,567,211 for the year ended December 31, 1997. The $131,653 increase in net interest income for the most recent year was due to a reduction of $545,200 in interest expense on deposit accounts from $6,048,828 in 1998 to $5,503,628 in 1999 due to a decrease in deposit balances, partially offset by a reduction in interest income of $340,464. The overall decline in interest income was attributable to a decrease in the average volume of the Company's securities portfolio during the period and, to a lesser extent, to a declining yield in the loan portfolio. Interest income from loans actually increased by $1,225,706 from $10,590,864 in 1998 to $11,816,570 in 1999 due to a $23,705,000, or 20.0%, increase in the average balance of loans outstanding during 1999. During 1998, the Bank instituted an automobile indirect lending program which accounted for the bulk of the increase in loans.           The decrease in net interest income for fiscal year 1998 as compared to fiscal year 1997 was primarily attributable to a significant decline in interest income which fell $1,587,696 (9.1%). The decline in interest income was attributable primarily to a reduced average volume of earning assets and secondarily to a declining yield on assets. The most significant reductions in earning assets involved the investment securities portfolio. The Company used the proceeds from maturing and called investment securities to cover deposit outflows. The Company also experienced a 66 basis point decline in the yield on the investment securities portfolio as the Company shifted its investment securities portfolio into repricable GNMA securities from state, county and municipal obligations. Interest expense declined $814,035, or 11.8%, for the year ended December 31, 1998. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 1999 was 4.96% compared to 4.94% and 5.09% for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.                                          23               The following table allocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume. Changes due to rate/volume are allocated to changes due to volume.

equivalent basis. The incremental tax rate applied was 38.62% for 1998 and   37.42% for 1997. 2 Non-accrual loans included in average balance.           PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company made a provision for credit losses of $300,000 compared to $(500,000) and $270,000 in provisions during the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The level of the provision for 1999 reflects the loan growth during the year. The recapture                                         25     of loss reserves during 1998 reflects improved asset quality and lower charge-off activity during 1998. At December 31, 1999, the allowance for loan losses equaled 276.97% of non-accrual and past due loans compared to 179.5% and 118.7% at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $219,429 compared to $798,336 and $1,191,196 in net charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997. The higher provision during fiscal year 1997 reflect the amount determined by the Company to be necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses to an adequate level after significant increases in loan charge-offs during that year.           OTHER INCOME. Other income decreased $294,488 (9.43%) during the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in other income was attributable primarily to net losses of $63,968 on sales of investment securities during 1999 as compared to net gains of $527,320 in 1998. This decline was partially offset by a non-recurring curtailment gain of $1,311,997 upon termination of the Bank's pension plan. The 1998 period had included a large nonrecurring gain of $1,126,077 upon the settlement of certain insurance matters. Other income increased $1,394,555 (81%) during the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. The bulk of the increase in other income during 1998 was attributable to $1,126,077 in proceeds from insurance settlements received during the year. Included in this figure was $1,125,000 received from the Bank's fidelity bond company in settlement of claims related to the activities of a former employee. Other income during 1998 also benefitted from a $256,000, or 95%, increase in gains on sales and calls of investment securities. In order to improve its interest rate sensitivity for fiscal 1998, the Bank sold $16.0 million in long-term, fixed-rate state, county and municipal securities and invested the proceeds in adjustable-rate, mortgage-backed securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA").           OTHER EXPENSES. Other expenses decreased by $1,954,790 or 16.60% for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to a net increase of $183,418 or 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 1998 over the year ended December 31, 1997. The decrease in other expenses was mainly due to the absence of any litigation charges during 1999. During 1998 the Company incurred $1,225,003 in litigation charges. Other noninterest expenses also decreased significantly from $4,112,919 in 1998 to $2,850,745 in 1999 due to a $1,448,519 or 66.95% reduction in professional fees, offset by increases in other expense items. Included in other expenses for 1998 were $1,225,003 in litigation charges, a $228,842, or 23%, increase over 1997. These charges related to the settlement of claims against the Bank in connection with payment of checks over fraudulent endorsements. Also included in other expenses for 1998 are $2,163,448 in professional service fees relating primarily to the litigation in which the Company was involved during the year.           INCOME TAXES. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,186,044 compared to tax expense of $806,247 during the year ended December 31, 1998 and a tax benefit of $315,284 during the year ended December 31, 1997. The increased tax level was due to the higher level of pre-tax income in 1999. Due primarily to its holdings of tax-exempt state, county and municipal securities, the Company recorded tax losses during the 1997 year. These net operating losses were applied to prior years' earnings resulting in tax benefits for the 1997 period. During 1998, however, the Company reduced its holdings of tax-exempt state, county and municipal securities and reinvested the proceeds in U.S. Government agency securities the income on which is not exempt from federal taxation. Accordingly, the Company had taxable income during 1998 and was required to provide for federal income taxes. The Company's income tax expense for 1998 also included $351,738 in disallowed claims for refunds of prior years' state taxes.  COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997           The Company's total assets decreased to $213,439,456 at December 31, 1999 after declining to $217,571,063 at December 31, 1998 from $231,899,594 at December 31, 1997. The decrease in assets during the year ended December 31, 1999 is a result primarily of a reduction in cash and cash equivalents along with a reduction from deposit balances. The reduction also reflects a reduction in the investment securities portfolio as the Company used cash flows from sales and maturities of investment securities to fund its indirect lending program.                                          26              During 1999, the Company's loan portfolio grew to $151,106,560 at December 31, 1999 compared to $125,501,252 at December 31, 1998 and $111,545,262 at December 31, 1997. The growth in the loan portfolio was attributable almost entirely to the Bank's indirect automobile lending program which was introduced in January 1998 and grew to $50,967,000 at December 31, 1999. Construction and land development loans also increased from $2,382,657 at December 31, 1998 to $6,094,894 at December 31, 1999. The Bank's other loan portfolios held steady or declined during the year.           The Company's total investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity) totaled $43,974,495 at December 31, 1999, a $21,511,332 or 32.85% decrease from $65,485,827 at December 31, 1998. During the year ended December 31, 1999, investment securities totaling $32,524,280 either matured or were sold with the funds primarily reinvested in loans rather than additional investment securities. Proceeds were also used to fund, in part, net deposit outflows of $5,521,120. During fiscal year 1998, total investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity) totaled $65,485,827 at December 31, 1998, a $16,371,844 or 20.0%, decrease from $81,857,671 at December 31, 1997. The Company used the proceeds from maturing and called securities to fund deposit outflows during the period.           Deposits as of December 31, 1999 totaled $194,089,995, a decrease of $5,521,120 (2.77%) for the year. Demand deposits as of December 31, 1999 totaled $45,144,293, a $216,483 (0.48%) decrease from $45,360,776 at December 31, 1998. NOW and Super NOW accounts as of December 31, 1999 declined by $2,037,973 or 9.89% to $18,562,778. Money market accounts decreased by $2,421,012 (12.08%) for the year to total $17,628,665 on December 31, 1999. Savings deposits increased by $150,833, or 0.37%. Time deposits over $100,000 totaled $6,345,179 on December 31, 1999, an increase of $586,910 (10.19%) from December 31, 1998. Other time deposits (made up of certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and individual retirement accounts) totaled $65,292,304 on December 31, 1999, a $1,583,395 (2.37%) decrease from December 31, 1998.           The Company experienced a $933,776, or 6.59% increase in total stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in stockholders' equity was attributable to the retention of earnings from the period less cash dividends paid and additional share issuances pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan, the stockholder purchase plan and the dividend reinvestment plan, partially offset by an other comprehensive loss of $435,823 resulting from unrealized losses on securities classified as available for sale. The Company experienced a $4,795,917, or 25.3% decrease in total stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 1998. The decrease in stockholders' equity was attributable to the repurchase of 213,168 shares of common stock from First Mariner Bancorp for an aggregate purchase price of $5,580,764 in November 1998.  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT           Net interest income, the primary component of the Company's net income, arises from the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. The Company manages its assets and liabilities by coordinating the levels of and gap between interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize changes in net interest income and in the economic value of its equity despite changes in market interest rates. The Bank's Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee meets on a monthly basis to monitor compliance with the Board's objectives. Among other tools used by the Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee to monitor interest rate risk is a "gap" report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing within a given time period. Generally, during a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap position would adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income, while, conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income.                                          27             During recent periods, the Company has maintained a negative gap position that has benefitted earnings as interest rates have fallen. In order to reduce its negative gap position, the Company has recently begun investing in mortgage-backed and other government securities which have rates that adjust to market rates. The Company also maintains a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities that can be quickly converted to more liquid assets if needed.           The following table sets forth the Bank's interest-rate sensitivity at December 31, 1999.

Mortgage-backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts are presumed to reprice at maturity. NOW savings accounts are assumed to reprice within three months although it is the Company's experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           The Company currently has no business other than that of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.                                          28               The Bank's principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income, deposits from its primary market area, principal and interest payments on loans, interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities. Its principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits. Deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the Bank's lending and investment activities. The Bank also uses borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta to supplement deposits. FHLB advances may only be used for residential and small business lending.           The Bank's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, federal funds sold and money market mutual funds. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank's operating financing and investment activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows.           Cash and cash equivalents (cash due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold), as of December 31, 1999, totaled $8,883,322, a decrease of $7,135,994 (44.55%) from the December 31, 1998 total of $16,019,316. Most of this decrease was in interest bearing deposits at other financial institutions which totaled $10,245 at December 31, 1999 compared to $4,958,337 at the end of 1998.           As of December 31, 1999, the Bank was permitted to draw on a $25,560,000 line of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta. Borrowings under the line are secured by a floating lien on the Bank's residential mortgage loans and its portfolio of U.S. Government and Agency Securities. As of December 31, 1999, $2.0 million was outstanding under this line. In addition the Bank has a secured line of credit in the amount of $5.0 million from another commercial bank on which it has not drawn.           Federal banking regulations require the Company and the Bank to maintain specified levels of capital. At December 31, 1999, the Company was in compliance with these requirements with a leverage ratio of 6.8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 9.5% and total risk-based capital ratio of 10.8%. At December 31, 1999, the Bank met the criteria for designation as a well capitalized depository institution under FDIC regulations.  IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES           The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company's assets and liabilities are monetary in mature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.  ITEM 7A.
