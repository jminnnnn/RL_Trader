ITEM 7.           Management's Discussion And Analysis Of                   Financial Condition And Results Of Operation.  Results Of Operation           In 1995, the Bank reported a net loss of ($1,678,941) as compared to 1994 net income of $3,516,593. The loss was primarily a result of loan losses related to several large, uncollectible loans. Non-recurring litigation and restructuring costs in 1995 totalled $1,407,641. Total assets grew 5.7% in 1995 with most of this growth in investment securities while gross loans declined by 1.5%. A 6% growth in deposits in 1995 accounted for the growth in assets.           The Company and its subsidiaries had a consolidated net loss of $1,726,748 ($2.01 per share) for 1995, a significant change from their 1994 consolidated net income of $3,516,593 ($4.22 per share) and their 1993 consolidated net income of $3,047,112 ($3.69 per share). The change is primarily due to a significant increase in the provision for loan losses of $7,925,000 for 1995 compared to $1,120,000 for 1994 and $1,080,000 for 1993. The increase resulted from provisions being made to charge-off delinquent and non-performing loans. The collectibility of certain loans, significant in aggregate amount, became doubtful during 1995 and the Bank charged-off a significant amount of such loans in 1996. The basic terms of the M.O.U. and possible sanctions should the Bank fail to adhere to it, and certain specific problem loans, are described under "Business."           The consolidated net interest income prior to making provision for credit losses decreased by $528,822 (4.5%) from $11,867,959 in 1994 to $11,339,137 in 1995. Net interest income had increased by $1,131,865 (10.5%) from $10,736,094 in 1993. The 1995 decrease is primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits which exceeded a slight increase in total interest revenues from lending activities for such period. The movement of deposits from lower yielding savings and money market accounts to higher yielding certificates of deposit resulted in an increase in the Bank's cost of deposits during 1995. In addition, the Bank wrote off approximately $220,000 in interest income during 1995 in connection with its charge-off of certain loans as described above.           Increased expenses of the Company and its subsidiaries in 1995 also resulted from $1,407,641 in litigation costs and costs relating to the 1995 directors' election contest. The Bank has obtained insurance reimbursement for approximately $560,000 of this amount and does not expect to have such charges (other than routine litigation costs) in the future.  Capital Resources and Liquidity           Total deposits increased from $208,565,653 at 1994 year end to $221,120,763 at the end of 1995, an increase of $12,555,110 (6.0%). Total deposits increased by $5,654,923 (2.8%) during 1994 from $202,910,730 at the end of 1993. While deposits have increased over the past two years, the Bank believes that a general downward trend in interest rates paid on deposit accounts has resulted in a trend away from lower yielding deposit products toward higher yielding long term deposits.           NOW accounts have remained relatively flat increasing by $472,703 in 1994 and $17,141 in 1995 from $21,800,005 at year end 1993. Over the same period, savings deposits after increasing slightly in 1994 from $52,764,881 in 1993 to $52,830,352 in 1994, declined to $46,752,665 at the end of 1995, a decrease of $6,077,687 (11.5%). Meanwhile, both certificates of deposit over $100,000 and other time deposits (made up of certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and individual retirement accounts) increased by $2,040,197 (26.1%) and $17,788,337 (34.4%), respectively in 1995. In 1994 certificates of deposit over $100,000 increased by $1,274,178 (19.5%) from $6,530,466 in 1993 and other time deposits increased by $4,250,550 (9.0%) from $47,445,457 in 1993.           The Bank's cash and cash equivalents (cash plus federal funds sold) as of December 31, 1995 ($9,450,021) was roughly the same as at December 31, 1994 ($9,606,316), which, in turn, was only 66.5% of the December 31, 1993 total of $14,435,017. The aggregate market value of investment securities held by the Bank as of December 31, 1995 was $74,690,073, compared to $59,024,129 as of December 31, 1994, a $15,665,944 (26.5%) increase. The reason for the large increase in investment securities during 1995 was the 6.0% increase in deposits coupled with declining loan demand. The market value of the Bank's investment securities as of December 31, 1994 had decreased by $2,436,148 (4.1%) from their December 31, 1993 total.                                          18              The Bank may draw on a $26,000,000 line of credit from The Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. As of December 31, 1994 $1,500,000 was outstanding under this line. No amounts were outstanding at the end of either 1995 or 1993.           The Bank's net loans decreased by $3,342,654 (2.2%) from $153,814,422 in 1994 to $150,471,768 in 1995. The 1994 net loan total increased by $11,948,629 (8.4%) from $141,865,793 in 1993. The variations are largely due to an increase in construction and land development loans in 1994 followed by a reduction in such loans in 1995. Residential and commercial mortgage loans increased during 1995 whereas lease financings and installment loans decreased. The Bank has determined to decrease its equipment and automobile lease based lending because of the difficulties in monitoring the financial condition of the clients of lease company borrowers.
