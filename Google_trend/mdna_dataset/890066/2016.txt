Total interest incomedecreased from $14,519,737 in 2014 to $13,605,649 in 2015, a 6.30% decrease. Interest expense for 2015 totaled $2,390,685, a 5.66%decrease from $2,533,922 in 2014. In spite of the impact the low interest rate environment had on net interest margin, the Companyrealized consolidated net income of $1,352,616 for 2015 by increasing non-interest income by $337,572 and decreasing other expensesby $481,762.     The Federal Reserve endedtheir aggressive Quantitative Easing program and is monitoring the rates of growth, unemployment, and inflation to which they expectthe national economy to converge over time in the absence of further shocks and under appropriate monetary policy. During December2015, the Federal Reserve concluded the national economy has shown considerable strength and decided to raise the Federal Fundsrate, further stating that it anticipates the pace of tightening to be gradual. Through this easing period, we experienced a decreasein outstanding loans and deposits while continuing to serve the needs of the communities we serve.     Comparison of Results of Operations forthe Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013     General.  For theyear ended December 31, 2015, the Company reported consolidated net income of $1,352,616 ($0.49 basic and diluted earnings pershare) compared to consolidated net income of $1,914,526 ($0.69   basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year endedDecember 31, 2014 and consolidated net income of $2,614,177 ($0.95   basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year endedDecember 31, 2013. The decrease in the 2015 consolidated net income was mainly due to decreases in loan income, a decrease in stateand municipal security income, a decrease in deposit expense, and an increase in provision for credit losses, partially offsetby an increase in other fees and commission income (due to the gain on the sale of insurance policies), and a decrease in otherexpenses. The decrease in the 2014 consolidated net income was mainly due to decreases in loan income, decreases in state and municipalsecurity income, an increase in other expenses, and an increase in provision for credit losses, which was partially offset by anincrease in gains on investment securities and decreases in employee benefits and deposit expense.     Net Interest Income. The primary component of the Company’s net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earnedon assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets. Net interest income is determinedby the spread between the yields earned on the Company’s interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilitiesas well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets,represents the Company’s net interest margin.     Net interest income isaffected by the mix of loans in the Bank’s loan portfolio. Currently a majority of the Bank’s loans are residentialand commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate and indirect automobile loans secured by automobiles.        21           Consolidated net interestincome for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11,214,964 compared to $11,985,815 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $12,620,060for the year ended December 31, 2013.    The $770,851 decrease for the most recent year was primarily due to the decline ininterest income on loans and securities being greater than the decline in interest expense on deposits. The $634,245 decrease for2014 was primarily due to the decline in interest income on loans and securities being greater than the decline in interest expenseon deposits. The net interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, for 2015 was $11,918,000, a $778,000 or 6.13% decrease from thetax equivalent basis net interest income for 2014, which was $12,696,000, a $785,000 or 5.82% increase from the after tax net interestincome for 2013.     Interest expense decreasedfrom $2,533,922 in 2014 to $2,390,685 in 2015, a $143,237 or a 5.66% decrease, primarily due to a decrease in average depositsas well as a decrease in our cost of deposits. Interest expense decreased from $2,661,805 in 2013 to $2,533,922 in 2014, a $127,883or a 4.80% decrease, primarily due to a decrease in deposit rates. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was3.16% compared to 3.50% and 3.72% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.        22           The following table allocateschanges in income and expense attributable to the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities forthe periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume.

 1 Tax equivalent basis. The incremental tax rate applied was 39.44% for 2015 and 37.69% for 2014.   2 Non-accrual loans included in average balance.        24           Provision for CreditLosses.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company made a provision of $1,695,000 for credit losses, compared toa provision of $1,021,000 and $260,000 for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In2015, the Bank increased its provision for credit losses primarily due to the increases in net charge-offs during the year, causingour historical loss ratios to increase thus needing to replace the reserves charged-off and increasing the expected reserves requiredfor future periods. There were two residential real estate investors that contributed greatly towards the need for additional provisionfor credit losses. One of these projects was resolved during the fourth quarter of 2015 resulting in a charge-off of $645,000 andthe remaining real estate investor has significant specific reserves allocated to their ten loans which are in non-accrual status.At December 31, 2015, the allowance for credit losses equaled 82.14% of non-accrual and past due loans compared to 104.84% and68.78% at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded net charge-offsof $1,663,000 compared to $875,000 and $596,000 in net charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.     Other Income.  Otherincome includes service charges on deposit accounts, other fees and commissions, net gains on investment securities, and incomeon Bank owned life insurance (BOLI). Other income increased from $2,670,498 in 2014   to $3,008,070 in 2015, a $337,582, or12.64% increase.   The increase was primarily due to an increase in other fees and commissions due to the income of $421,067on the sale of insurance policies during the third quarter of 2015. Other income   increased from $2,001,216 in 2013 to $2,670,498in 2014, a $669,282, or 33.45% increase. The increase was primarily due to a increase in gains on securities partially offset bya decrease in service charges on deposit accounts.     Other Expenses.  Other expenses, which consist of non-interest operating expenses, decreased from $11,412,259 in 2014 to $10,930,497 in 2015, a$481,762 or 4.22% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other expenses because of a reduction in marketingexpenses, in salaries and wages, employee benefits, occupancy expense, and the reversal of the reserve for unfunded commitmentsduring the fourth quarter of 2015 of $188,233, offset by increases in the other categories. Other expenses, which consist of non-interestoperating expenses, increased from $11,113,244 in 2013 to $11,412,259 in 2014, a $299,015 or 2.69% increase. This increase wasprimarily due to increases in other professional expenses and a write-down of loan fees receivable deemed to be uncollectable.     Income Taxes.  Duringthe year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $244,921, compared to an income tax expense of$308,652 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net income before taxes. Duringthe year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $308,652, compared to an income tax expense of$633,855 for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was due to the decrease in net income before taxes.     Comparison of Financial Condition at December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013     The Company’s totalassets decreased to $390,580,191 at December 31, 2015 from $394,629,508 at December 31, 2014. The Company’s total assetsincreased to $394,629,508 at December 31, 2014 from $377,193,574 at December 31, 2013.     The Company’s netloan portfolio decreased to $259,636,706 at December 31, 2015 compared to $273,986,237 at December 31, 2014 and $270,684,120 atDecember 31, 2013. In 2015, the decrease in the loan portfolio was primarily due to decreases in indirect loans, purchase moneymortgage and refinance loans with lesser decreases in other areas. These decreases were partially offset by increases in home equityloans and commercial and industrial loans with lesser increases in other areas. In 2015, mortgage participations sold also increased.In 2014, the increase in the loan portfolio was primarily due to increases in indirect loans, purchase money mortgage, and commercialand industrial construction loans, partially offset by decreases in refinance mortgage loans and commercial and industrial mortgages.     During 2015, the Company’stotal investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held tomaturity) totaled   $98,790,010, a $10,796,865 or 12.27%,   increase from   $87,993,145 at December 31, 2014.  This increase was due to investing excess liquidity, which led to an increase in U. S. Government agencies and mortgage backedsecurities, offset by decreases in U. S. Treasury securities and state and municipal securities. During 2014, the Company’stotal investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held tomaturity) totaled   $87,993,145, a $13,679,463 or 18.41%, increase from   $74,313,682 at December 31, 2013.   Thisincrease is due to an increase in U.S. Treasury Notes, mortgage backed securities and state and municipal securities. The marketvalue of municipal securities also increased from 2013 to 2014 and contributed to this increase.        25           Depositsas of December 31, 2015 totaled $335,191,530, a decrease of $3,685,762, or 1.09%, from the $338,877,292 total as of December 31,2014. Deposits as of December 31, 2014 totaled $338,877,292, an increase of $15,073,936, or 4.66%, from the $323,803,356 totalas of December 31, 2013. Demand deposits as of December 31, 2015 totaled $93,584,864, a $5,021,940, or 5.67%, increase from $88,562,924at December 31, 2014. NOW and Super NOW accounts, as of December 31, 2015, increased by $511,742, or 1.90% from their 2014 levelto $27,502,016. Money market accounts decreased by $1,385,900, or 6.78%, from their 2014 level, to total $19,079,536 at December31, 2015. Savings deposits increased by $3,134,875, or 4.19%, from their 2014 level, to $78,107,913 at December 31, 2015. Timedeposits over $100,000 totaled $51,527,624 on December 31, 2015, a decrease of $3,576,360, or 6.49% from December 31, 2014. Othertime deposits (made up of certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and individual retirement accounts) totaled $65,389,577 onDecember 31, 2015, a $7,392,059 or 10.16% decrease from December 31, 2014.     Total stockholders’equity as of December 31, 2015   increased by $345,286, or 1.02%,   from the 2014 period.   The increase was attributedto the increase in retained earnings of $605,408, offset by the accumulated other comprehensive income in 2014 now being a loss(a $404,464 change) and by cash dividends paid, net of dividends reinvested.    Total stockholders’ equity as of December31, 2014 increased by $2,247,366, or 7.12%, from the 2013 period. The increase was attributed to the 2013 accumulated other comprehensiveloss now being comprehensive income in 2014 (a $1,280,805 change) and an increase in retained earnings from current year net income,offset by cash dividends paid, net of dividends reinvested.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees,elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.     Loan commitments and linesof credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts. Loan commitmentsgenerally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts, fixed expiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Linesof credit generally have variable interest rates. Many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire withoutbeing drawn upon; accordingly, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluateseach customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral or other security obtained, if deemednecessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but mayinclude deposits held in financial institutions, U.S. Treasury securities, other marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory,property and equipment, personal residences, income-producing commercial properties, and land under development. Personal guaranteesare also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments.     Letters of credit are conditionalcommitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issuedto guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing lettersof credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds collateral and obtainspersonal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary.     The Bank’s exposureto credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment.     Currently, we break-out our unfunded commitmentsinto the following categories:    o Unfunded Construction commitments   o Unfunded Commercial lines of credit and other   o Unfunded Home Equity LOC   o Unfunded Demand Deposit overdraft LOC   o Committed Loans which have not closed   o Letters of Credit     During 2015, we revised the calculations forthe following categories:    o Unfunded Commercial lines of credit and other – reduce reserve percentage to zero due tothe Bank’s ability of having sole discretion on future funding of any specific account (customer must request funding andthe Bank does not have to fund the request if we deem the account is no longer worthy of continued funding; we freeze all fundingof accounts that are past due and/or in non-accrual status; and based on historical loss ratios)        26            o Unfunded Home Equity LOC – reduce reserve percentage to zero because the Bank has the abilityto freeze any account based on activity of the account or information which the Bank may obtain such as a drastic decline in collateralvalue and based on historical loss ratios.   o Unfunded Demand Deposit overdraft LOC – reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historicalloss ratios.     We did not change the calculations for the othercategories even though we have similar rights as those categories above for the following reasons:      o Constructions loans – we have the sole discretion to fund these requests, however not fundinga construction request can have a material negative impact of our collateral value and therefore we will continue to allocate reservesfor the unfunded amounts using the same loss ratio as the funded portion of the portfolio.   o Committed Loans which have not closed – we have the sole discretion to not fund these loansshould material adverse information become known to the Bank, however we are typically near the final stages of our due diligenceunderwriting of the loan and feel we have similar loss exposure as already funded loans therefore will continue to use the sameloss ratio as funded loans.   o Letters of Credit – in most instances, we must fund the Letter of Credit if such a requestis made and do not have the sole discretion as we do for other categories.      	Based on the above changes in estimate,we made a negative provision of $188,233 for Allowance for Unfunded Commitments which is included as a contra-expense in “Otherexpenses”. Loan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including collateral,as outstanding loans. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank has accrued $11,767, a decrease of $188,233 from 2014, for unfunded commitmentsrelated to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, which is included in other liabilities.     Market Risk Management     Market risk is the riskof loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange ratesor equity pricing. The Company’s principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from its lending, investing anddeposit taking activities. The Company’s profitability is dependent on the Bank’s net interest income. Interest raterisk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at differentintervals than interest earning assets. The Bank’s Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee oversees the managementof interest rate risk. The primary purpose of the committee is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changesdue to interest rate fluctuations. The Company does not utilize derivative financial or commodity instruments or hedging strategiesin its management of interest rate risk. The primary tool used by the committee to monitor interest rate risk is a “gap”report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities subjectto repricing within a given time period. These efforts affect the loan pricing and deposit rate policies of the Company as wellas the asset mix, volume guidelines, and liquidity and capital planning.        27           The following table setsforth the Bank’s interest-rate sensitivity at December 31, 2015.                          Over 1                               Over 3 to      Through      Over                 0-3 Months      12 Months      5 Years      5 Years      Total          (Dollars in Thousands)     Assets:                                                Cash and due from banks    $ -      $ -      $ -      $ -      $ 9,802     Federal funds and overnight deposits      2,570        -        -        -        2,570     Securities      -        -        2,991        95,799        98,790     Loans      6,503        7,071        82,420        163,643        259,637     Fixed assets      -        -        -        -        3,369     Other assets      -        -        -        -        16,412                                                      Total assets    $ 9,073      $ 7,071      $ 85,411      $ 259,442      $ 390,580                                                      Liabilities:                                                Demand deposit accounts    $ -      $ -      $ -      $ -      $ 93,585     NOW accounts      27,502        -        -        -        27,502     Money market deposit accounts      19,080        -        -        -        19,080     Savings accounts      78,013        95        -        -        78,108     IRA accounts      3,625        8,599        24,489        1,281        37,994     Certificates of deposit      11,171        21,443        46,205        104        78,923     Long-term borrowings      -        -        20,000        -        20,000     Other liabilities      -        -        -        -        1,212     Stockholders’ equity:      -        -        -        -        34,176                                                      Total liabilities and stockholders' equity    $ 139,391      $ 30,137      $ 90,694      $ 1,385      $ 390,580                                                      GAP    $ (130,318 )    $ (23,066 )    $ (5,283 )    $ 258,057              Cumulative GAP    $ (130,318 )    $ (153,384 )    $ (158,667 )    $ 99,390              Cumulative GAP as a % of total assets      -33.37 %      -39.27 %      -40.62 %      25.45 %               The foregoing analysisassumes that the Bank’s assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity.Mortgage backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed thatloans and other securities are not called prior to maturity. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts are presumed to reprice atmaturity. NOW savings accounts are assumed to reprice at within three months although it is the Company’s experience thatsuch accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates.     In addition to gap analysis,the Bank utilizes a simulation model to quantify the effect a hypothetical immediate plus or minus 200 basis point change in rateswould have on net interest income and the economic value of equity. The model takes into consideration the effect of call featuresof investments as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates. When actual changes in interest rates occur, thechanges in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model and, in theBank’s experience, the changes historically realized have been narrower than those projected by the model. However, the Bankbelieves that the model is a prudent forecasting tool. As of December 31, 2015, the model produced the following sensitivity profilefor net interest income and the economic value of equity.          28                  Immediate Change in Rates          -200      -100      +100      +200          Basis Points      Basis Points      Basis Points      Basis Points                                     % Change in Net Interest Income      -5.6 %      -1.6 %      -0.6 %      -2.9 %   % Change in Economic Value of Equity      -8.4 %      -0.8 %      -7.0 %      -15.5 %      Liquidity and Capital Resources     The Company currently hasno business other than that of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments. The Company’s principalsources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictionson the payment of dividends.     The Bank’s principalsources of funds for investments and operations are net income, deposits from its primary market area, principal and interest paymentson loans, interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities. Its principal funding commitmentsare for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits. Deposits are considered the primary source offunds supporting the Bank’s lending and investment activities. The Bank also uses borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta tosupplement deposits, residential and small business lending, and to meet specific and anticipated needs.     The Bank’s most liquidassets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, federal funds sold and moneymarket mutual funds. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank’s operating financing and investment activitiesat any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated futuredeposit flows.     Cash and cash equivalents(cash due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold), as of December 31, 2015,totaled $12,371,408 ,  a decrease of $908,826 or 6.85%, from the December 31, 2014 total of $13,280,234. This decrease wasdue to the outflow of deposits and the reduction in loans offset by the purchase of securities.     As of December 31, 2015,the Bank was permitted to draw on a $71.82 million line of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta. Borrowings under the line are securedby a floating lien on the Bank’s residential first mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2015, there was nothing outstandingunder the daily rate credit. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had a $10 million convertible advance (callable monthly and witha final maturity of November 1, 2017)   from the FHLB of Atlanta. This advance has a 3.28% rate of interest. In addition,the Bank had   a $5 million convertible advance settled July 21, 2008 with a final maturity of July 23, 2018. This advancehas a 2.73% rate of interest and is callable quarterly. Furthermore, the Bank had a $5 million convertible advance taken out August22, 2008 which has a final maturity of August 22, 2018. This advance has a 3.34% rate of interest and is callable quarterly.In addition, the Bank has three unsecured lines of credit totaling $3 million, $5 million, and $8 million, on which there wereno outstanding balances at December 31, 2015.     Federal banking regulationsrequire the Company and the Bank to maintain specified levels of capital. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance withthese requirements with a leverage ratio of 8.77%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.23%, a total risk-based capital ratioof 15.48% and a common equity tier I capital of 14.23%. At December 31, 2015, the Bank met the criteria for designation as a wellcapitalized depository institution under FDIC regulations.     Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices     The consolidated financialstatements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, whichrequire the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changesin the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company’sassets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company’s performancethan do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the sameextent as the prices of goods and services.        29           Critical Accounting Policies     The Company’s accountingpolicies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, starting on page F-8 and areessential to understanding Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As discussedthere, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requiresmanagement to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements andaccompanying notes. Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the determination of estimatesrequires the exercise of judgment. Management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to valuethe related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to be reasonableunder the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financialstatements. The Company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change. Historically, actual results have not differedsignificantly from the Company’s estimates. The following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimates and principlesinvolved in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, including the identification of the variables most importantin the estimation process:     Allowance for CreditLosses.  The Bank’s allowance for credit losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actualevents occur, including historical losses as an indicator of future losses, fair market value of collateral, and various generalor industry or geographic specific economic events.  The use of these estimates and values is inherently subjective and theactual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.  For further information regarding our allowance for credit losses,see “Allowance for Credit Losses” under Item 1- “Business” of this Annual Report.     Accrued Taxes.  Managementestimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities. Income taxes are discussed in moredetail in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be receivedfrom taxing authorities. In estimating accrued taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate taxtreatment of transactions taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company’stax position.     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements     The FASB has issued severalexposure drafts which, if adopted, would significantly alter the Company’s (and all other financial institutions’)method of accounting for, and reporting, its financial assets and some liabilities from a historical cost method to a fair valuemethod of accounting as well as the reported amount of net interest income. Also, the FASB has issued an exposure draft regardinga change in the accounting for leases. Under this exposure draft, the total amount of “lease rights” and total amountof future payments required under all leases would be reflected on the balance sheets of all entities as assets and debt. If thechanges under discussion in either of these exposure drafts are adopted, the financial statements of the Company could be materiallyimpacted as to the amounts of recorded assets, liabilities, capital, net interest income, interest expense, depreciation expense,rent expense and net income. The Company has not determined the extent of the possible changes at this time. The exposure draftsare in different stages of review, approval and possible adoption.     ASU 2013-02, “ComprehensiveIncome (Topic 220) – Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” ASU 2013-02amends recent guidance related to the reporting of comprehensive income to enhance the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulatedother comprehensive income. ASU 2013-02 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2013 and did not have a significantimpact on the Company’s financial statements.     ASU 2013-08, “FinancialServices – Investment Companies (Topic 946) – Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirements.”  ASU 2013-08clarifies the characteristics of investment companies and sets forth a new approach for determining whether a company is an investmentcompany. The fundamental characteristics of an investment company include (i) the company obtains funds from investors andprovides the investors with investment management services; (ii) the company commits to its investors that its business purposeand only substantive activities are investing the funds for returns solely from capital appreciation, investment income, or both;and (iii) the company or its affiliates do not obtain or have the objective of obtaining returns or benefits from an investeeor its affiliates that are not normally attributable to ownership interests or that are other than capital appreciation or investmentincome.
