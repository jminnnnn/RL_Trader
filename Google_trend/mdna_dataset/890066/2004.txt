ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Overview          During 2003, the Company continued many favorable operating trends. Most notably, the Banks net income grew from $2,811,083 in 2002 to $3,077,074 in 2003, a 9.46% increase in net income. In addition, 2003 saw significant growth in both the Banks deposits and investment portfolio. Deposit growth in 2003 was strong with increases of $4,901,787 in interest bearing deposits and $10,586,841 in non-interest bearing demand deposits. Investment portfolio growth was due primarily to the increase in the Banks investment in state and municipal bonds which had grown to $43,624,164.   Forward-Looking Statements          When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words or phrases will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, estimate, project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and readers are advised that various factors, including regional and national economic conditions, unfavorable judicial decisions, substantial changes in levels of market interest rates, credit and other risks of lending and investment activities and competitive and regulatory factors could affect the Companys financial performance and could cause the Companys actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected.        The Company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.   Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001           General.  For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company reported consolidated net income of $3,077,074 ($1.83 basic and diluted earnings per share) compared to consolidated net income of $2,811,083 ($1.68 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2002 and consolidated net income of $1,725,236 ($1.04 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2001. (All per share amounts throughout this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to a three-for-two stock split effected through a stock dividend paid on June 21, 2001.) Income for 2002 included a $763,644 curtailment gain on a post retirement benefit plan amendment. Net income for 2002, adjusted to remove the effects of this item, net of taxes, was $2,342,358.         Net Interest Income.  The primary component of the Companys net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets. Net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the Companys interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets, represents the Companys net interest margin.        Consolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $11,263,294 compared to $11,368,150 for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $10,673,730 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The $104,856 decrease for the most recent year was due to a decrease in loan and federal funds income, partially offset by a decrease in deposit expense. The $694,420 increase in net interest income for 2002 as compared to 2001 was due to a decrease in the interest expense on deposits combined with an increase in interest income on state and municipal securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest income on loans. Since a large portion of the Companys portfolio is invested in state and municipal securities, which are tax advantaged, the after tax net interest income for 2003 was $12,193,604, a $307,460 or 2.58% increase over the $11,886,144 after tax net interest income for 2002, which was an increase of $827,939 or 7.49% compared to $11,058,205 in after tax net interest income for 2001.        Interest expense decreased from $5,202,132 in 2002 to $4,276,724 in 2003, a $925,408, or 17.79% decrease, primarily due to decreases in deposit rates. Interest expense decreased from $6,533,274 in 2001 to   21        $5,202,132 in 2002, a $1,331,142, or 20.4% decrease, primarily due to decreases in interest rates. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 4.48% compared to 4.76% and 4.80% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.        The following table allocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Companys interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume. Changes due to rate/volume are allocated to changes due to volume.

basis. The incremental tax rate applied was 35.23% for 2003 and 30.73% for 2002.           2         Non-accrual loans included in average balance.              Provision For Credit Losses.  During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company made a provision of $40,000 for credit losses, compared to no provision during the year ended December 31, 2002, and a negative $150,000 provision during the year ended December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2003, the allowance for loan losses equaled 385.25% of non-accrual and past due loans compared to 429.13% and 445.30% at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded net chargeoffs of $308,306 compared to $423,755 and $296,360 in net charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.   23              Other Income.  Other income includes service charges on deposit accounts, other fees and commissions, net gains on investment securities, and income on life insurance (including bank owned life insurance income (BOLI) and gains of approximately $117,000 from the death of an officer). For 2002, other income also included a curtailment gain of $763,644 on a post-retirement benefit plan amendment. Other income decreased from $2,484,725 in 2002 to $2,289,413 in 2003, a $195,312, or 7.86% decrease. The decrease was primarily due to the curtailment gain realized in 2002, partially offset by gains on investment securities, an increase in BOLI income and an increase in service charge income. Other income increased from $1,821,138 in 2001 to $2,484,725 in 2002, a $663,587, or 36.4% increase. The increase was largely due to the 2002 non-recurring curtailment gain and increases in income on service charges and other fees and commissions, partially offset by a decrease in securities gains realized.         Other Expenses.  Other expenses decreased from $9,956,847 in 2002 to $9,747,693 in 2003, a $209,154 or 2.1% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in furniture and fixtures expense and operating expense, offset by an increase in employee benefits and occupancy expense relating to the opening of the Severna Park location. Other expenses decreased from $10,332,093 in 2001 to $9,956,847 in 2002, a $375,246 or 3.6% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in other operating expenses and employee benefit costs, which were partially offset by an increase in salaries and wages.         Income Taxes.  During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded income tax expense of $687,940, compared to income tax expense of $1,084,945 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in income tax expense for 2003 as compared to 2002, despite higher net income in 2003, was primarily due to the tax advantaged treatment of the state and municipal securities portfolio and BOLI income. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded income tax expense of $1,084,945, compared to income tax expense of $587,539 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in income tax expense for 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to the curtailment gain on post retirement benefits and an increase in net interest income partially offset by the tax benefits from the Companys increased investment in state and municipal securities.   Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001          The Companys total assets increased to $302,252,466 at December 31, 2003 from $279,406,206 at December 31, 2002. The increase in total assets during the year ended December 31, 2003 is a result of an increase in the loan and securities portfolio, offset by a decrease in federal funds sold due to a redeployment of assets. The Companys total assets increased to $279,406,206 at December 31, 2002 from $263,361,726 at December 31, 2001. The increase in assets during the year ended December 31, 2002 is a result primarily of growth in investment securities and other total assets partially offset by a decrease in the loan portfolio.        The Companys loan portfolio increased to $172,819,049 at December 31, 2003 compared to $158,286,746 at December 31, 2002 and $164,569,252 at December 31, 2001. The increase in the loan portfolio during the 2003 period is primarily due to residential mortgage loans increasing by approximately $14.9 million with lesser increases in the other loan portfolios, partially offset by a decline in the commercial loan portfolio. The decline in the loan portfolio during the 2002 period is attributable almost entirely to a decrease in the indirect automobile portfolio. The decrease in indirect automobile lending can be at least partially attributed to zero percent financing offered by automobile manufacturers after September 2001.        During 2003, the Companys total investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity) totaled $103,181,107, a $11,321,056 or 12.32%, increase from $91,860,051 at December 31, 2002. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in state and municipal and U.S. Government agency securities, offset by a decrease in mortgage backed securities. During 2002, the Companys total investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity) totaled $91,860,051, a $19,795,130 or 27.5%, increase from $72,064,921 at December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily attributable to growth in mortgage backed and state and municipal securities, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Government agency securities.        Deposits as of December 31, 2003 totaled $256,908,235, an increase of $15,488,628, or 6.42%, from the $241,419,607 total as of December 31, 2002. The $241,419,607 in total deposits as of December 31, 2002 was a $12,112,889 or 5.3% increase from the $229,306,717 total deposits as of December 31, 2001. Demand deposits as of December 31, 2003 totaled $69,648,819, a $10,586,842 or 17.92% increase from $59,061,977 at December 31, 2002. NOW and Super NOW accounts as of December 31, 2003 increased by $4,329,331 or 17.99% from their 2002 level to $28,400,505. Money market accounts increased by $254,674 or 1.28%, from their 2002 level to total   24        $20,144,401 December 31, 2003. Savings deposits increased by $5,762,412, or 12.10%, from their 2002 level, to $53,378,579 at December 31, 2003. Time deposits over $100,000 totaled $21,549,128 on December 31, 2003, an increase of $3,850,569, or 21.76% from December 31, 2002. Other time deposits (made up of certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and individual retirement accounts) totaled $63,786,805 on December 31, 2003, a $9,295,199 or a 12.72%, decrease from December 31, 2002.        Total stockholders equity as of December 31, 2003 increased by $2,158,242, or 9.91%, from the 2002 period. The increase was attributed to an increase in retained earnings and surplus, offset by a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Total stockholders equity as of December 31, 2002 increased by $3,927,801, or 22.0%, from the 2001 period. The increase was attributed to an increase in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, and Commitments           Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  The Bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.        Loan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts. Loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts, fixed expiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates. Many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon; accordingly, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customers creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral or other security obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on managements credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include deposits held in financial institutions, U.S. Treasury securities, other marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, personal residences, income-producing commercial properties, and land under development. Personal guarantees are also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments.        Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds collateral and obtains personal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary.        The Banks exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment. Loan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including collateral, as outstanding loans. As of December 31, 2003, the Bank has accrued $150,000 for unfunded commitments related to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, which is included in other liabilities.         Contractual Obligations.  The following table presents, as of December 31, 2003, significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                     PAYMENTS DUE IN                                                        ONE TO         THREE TO         OVER                          NOTE         ONE YEAR         THREE         FIVE         FIVE                (IN THOUSANDS)         REFERENCE         OR LESS         YEARS         YEARS         YEARS         TOTAL         Deposits without a stated maturity (a),(c)              9              $    171,572              $                  $                  $                  $    171,572            Time deposits (a)              9                   47,148                   21,952                   14,848                   1,388                   85,336            Short-term borrowings (a)              6                   6,602                                                                            6,602            Long-term borrowings (b)              7,8                   573                   1,153                   1,161                   13,320                   16,207            Operating leases              5                   102                   60                   30                                      192                     (a)         Excludes interest               (b)         Includes Junior Subordinated Debentures and semi-annual payments (made in March and September) of $273,215.

Further discussion of these commitments is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                             PAYMENTS DUE IN                                    ONE TO         THREE TO         OVER                          ONE YEAR         THREE         FIVE         FIVE                (IN THOUSANDS)         OR LESS         YEARS         YEARS         YEARS         TOTAL         Loan commitments:                                                                                                           Other mortgage loans         $    2,082              $                  $                  $                  $    2,082            Unused lines of credit:                                                                                                           Home-equity lines              207                   71                   1,050                   3,340                   4,668            Commercial lines              8,501                                                                            8,501            Unsecured consumer lines              983                                                                            983            Letters of credit              106                                                         667                   773               Asset/Liability Management          Net interest income, the primary component of the Companys net income, arises from the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. The Company manages its assets and liabilities by coordinating the levels of and gap between interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize changes in net interest income and in the economic value of its equity despite changes in market interest rates. The Banks Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee meets on a monthly basis to monitor compliance with the Boards objectives. Among other tools used by the Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee to monitor interest rate risk is a gap report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing within a given time period. Generally, during a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap position would adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income, while, conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income.        During recent periods, the Company has maintained a negative gap position that has benefited earnings as interest rates have fallen. In order to reduce its negative gap position, the Company has recently begun investing in mortgage-backed and other government securities which have rates that adjust to market rates. The Company also maintains a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities that can be quickly converted to more liquid assets if needed.        The following table sets forth the Banks interest-rate sensitivity at December 31, 2003.   26                                                                                                                                                      Over 3 To         Over 1         Over 5                          0-3 Months         12 Months         Through 5 Years         Years         Total                                    (Dollars In Thousands)                             Assets:                                                                                                           Cash and due from banks         $                  $                  $                  $                  $    11,120            Federal funds and overnight deposits              1,775                                                                            1,775            Securities                                 3,057                   12,054                   88,967                   104,078            Loans              16,578                   3,036                   75,996                   79,455                   175,065            Fixed Assets                                                                                          4,220            Other Assets                                                                                          5,994                                                                                                                       Total assets         $    18,353              $    6,093              $    88,050              $    168,422              $    302,252                                                                                                                      Liabilities:                                                                                                          Demand deposit accounts         $                  $                  $                  $                  $    69,649            NOW accounts              28,401                                                                            28,401            Money market deposit accounts              20,144                                                                            20,144            Savings accounts              53,378                   197                                                         53,575            IRA accounts              1,904                   4,050                   15,005                   1,193                   22,152            Certificates of deposit              11,961                   29,036                   21,795                   195                   62,987            Other liabilities                                                                                          16,241            Junior Subordinated Debenture                                                                                           5,155            Stockholders equity                                                                                          23,948                                                                                                                       Total liabilities and Stockholders equity         $    115,788              $    33,283              $    36,800              $    1,388              $    302,252                                                                                                                      GAP         $    (97,435    )         $    (27,190    )         $    51,250              $    167,034                               Cumulative GAP              (97,435    )              (124,625    )              (73,375    )              93,659                                Cumulative GAP as a % of total assets              (32.37    %)              (41.40    %)              (24.37    %)              31.11    %                                   The foregoing analysis assumes that the Banks assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity. Mortgage-backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts are presumed to reprice at maturity. NOW savings accounts are assumed to reprice within three months although it is the Companys experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates.   Liquidity and Capital Resources          The Company currently has no business other than that of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments. The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.        The Banks principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income, deposits from its primary market area, principal and interest payments on loans, interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities. Its principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits. Deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the Banks lending and investment activities. The Bank also uses borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta to supplement deposits, residential and small business lending, and to meet specific and anticipated needs.        The Banks most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, federal funds sold and money market mutual funds. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Banks operating financing and investment activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows.        Cash and cash equivalents (cash due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold), as of December 31, 2003, totaled $12,894,894, a decrease of $2,847,194 or 18.09%, from the December 31, 2002 total of $15,742,088. Most of this decrease was due to a reduction in the federal funds sold.        As of December 31, 2003, the Bank was permitted to draw on a $36.2 million line of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta. Borrowings under the line are secured by a floating lien on the Banks residential mortgage loans and its portfolio of U.S. Government and agency securities. As of December 31, 2003, a $7 million long-term convertible advance was outstanding under this line. In addition the Bank has a secured line of credit in the amount of  $ 5   27        million from another commercial bank on which it has not drawn. Furthermore, on September 7, 2000, the Company issued $5,155,000 of its 10.6% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures to Glen Burnie Statutory Trust I, a Connecticut statutory trust wholly owned by the Company. The Trust, in turn, issued $5,000,000 of its 10.6% capital securities to institutional investors. The debentures are scheduled to mature on September 7, 2030, unless called by the Company not earlier than September 7, 2010. As of December 31, 2003, the full $5,155,000 was outstanding.        Federal banking regulations require the Company and the Bank to maintain specified levels of capital. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with these requirements with a leverage ratio of 9.25%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.54% and total risk-based capital ratio of 15.79%. At December 31, 2003, the Bank met the criteria for designation as a well capitalized depository institution under FDIC regulations.   Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices          The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Companys assets and liabilities are monetary in mature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Companys performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.   Critical Accounting Policies          The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, starting on page F-8 and are essential to understanding Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As discussed there, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The Company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change. Historically, actual results have not differed significantly from the Companys estimates. The following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimates and principles involved in the preparation of the Companys financial statements, including the identification of the variables most important in the estimation process:         Allowance for Credit Losses.  The Banks allowance for credit losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur, including historical losses as an indicator of future losses, fair market value of collateral, and various general or industry or geographic specific economic events. The use of these estimates and values is inherently subjective and the actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates. For further information regarding our allowance for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses under Item 1- Business of this Annual Report.         Accrued Taxes.  Management estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities. Income taxes are discussed in more detail in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities. In estimating accrued taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the Companys tax position.   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements          In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretations No. 46 (FIN 46),  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities , which provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity (VIE) and determine when the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests, and results of operations of a VIE are to be included in an entitys consolidated financial statements. A VIE exists when either the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities by itself, or the equity investors lack one of three characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest. Those characteristics include the   28        direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entitys activities through voting rights or similar rights, the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity if they occur, or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur.        During the third quarter of 2003, the Company applied the provisions of FIN 46 to a wholly-owned subsidiary trust that issued capital securities to third-party investors. The application of FIN 46 resulted in the deconsolidation of a wholly-owned subsidiary trust. See Note 8 for further discussion of this trust and the Companys related obligations.        In December 2003, the FASB reissued FIN 46 with certain modifications and clarifications. Application of this guidance was effective for interests in certain VIEs commonly referred to as special-purpose entities (SPEs) as of December 31, 2003. Application for all other types of entities is required for periods ending after March 15, 2004, unless previously applied.        Management continues to evaluate the applicability of FIN 46. Management does not believe that the application of FIN 46 will have an impact on financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The Federal Reserve Board is currently evaluating the impact on Tier 1 capital.        In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149,  Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under SFAS 133, as well as amends certain other existing FASB pronouncements. In general, SFAS 149 is effective for derivative transactions entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on financial condition, the results of operations, or liquidity, as the Company and Bank does not have derivative or hedging instruments.        In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150,  Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity . This Statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The provisions of SFAS 150 became effective June 1, 2003, for all financial instruments created or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise became effective as of July 1, 2003. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on financial condition, the results of operations, or liquidity.        In December 2003, the FASB deferred for an indefinite period the application of the guidance in SFAS 150 to noncontrolling interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in the parents financial statements under SFAS 150. The deferral is limited to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests associated with finite-lived subsidiaries. Management does not believe any such applicable entities exist as of December 31, 2003.        In March 2003, the SEC issued Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. As defined in Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys historical or future performance, financial position, or cash flow that excludes or includes amounts or adjustments that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Companies that present non-GAAP financial measures must disclose a numerical reconciliation to the most directly comparable measurement using GAAP.        In January 2003, the SEC adopted final rules implementing Section 401(a) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, which requires disclosure of off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations in a public companys periodic SEC reports. Off-balance sheet arrangements include guarantees and similar arrangements that may be a source of potential risk to a companys future liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, regardless of whether or not they are recorded as liabilities. The definition uses GAAP concepts to identify the four types of arrangements for which disclosure is required: guarantee contracts, retained or contingent liabilities, certain derivative instruments and variable interests. Off-balance sheet arrangements that either have, or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect that is material to investors with respect to the companys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources must be disclosed. Companies must explain the reasons for using off-balance sheet arrangements, the financial importance and magnitude thereof and circumstances that could trigger obligations. The Companys off-balance sheet arrangements consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and have been discussed elsewhere in this report.   29             Under the final rules, tabular disclosure of contractual obligations for specified time periods must also be made. Contractual obligations must be aggregated into categories applicable to a companys business, for example (i) long-term debt, (ii) capital lease obligations, (iii) operating leases, (iv) purchase obligations, and (v) other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under GAAP. However, each company should use categories suitable to its business. See Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, and Commitments for the Companys presentation of the information required by the new rules.      ITEM 7A.
