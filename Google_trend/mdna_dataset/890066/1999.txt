Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Overview           The year 1998 saw the continuation of a favorable trend as asset quality continued to improve. Nonperforming loans declined to 1.36% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 1998 from 2.99% at December 31, 1997 and 3.55% at December 31, 1996. Net charge-offs declined to 0.67% of average loans for the year compared to 1.00% for 1997 and 3.56% for 1996. The improvements in asset quality were achieved primarily through the resolution of nonperforming loans and improved underwriting on new loans. The Bank's asset quality ratios were also helped by the reversal of what had been an unfavorable trend over the past several years, i.e., a shrinking loan portfolio. 1998 saw the first year over year increase in the size of the loan portfolio in the past three years. The Bank's loan growth came principally from the Bank's indirect automobile lending program which was introduced in January 1998 and had grown to a portfolio of $24.6 million by years' end.           As a result of its improved asset quality, the Company was able to recapture into income $500,000 of allowances for credit losses. Improving asset quality also led to the termination of the Memorandum of Understanding into which the Board of Directors had previously entered with federal and state banking regulators to address asset quality concerns, among other things. Although the Memorandum of Understanding did not materially restrict day-to-day operations, the mere existence of the Memorandum of Understanding meant that the Bank was not able to obtain the regulatory approvals required to expand its business. Since the Memorandum of Understanding was lifted, the Bank has been able to open an additional branch.           Despite these favorable developments, net income was only up slightly from 1997. The Company's earnings performance continues to be undermined by a high level of non-interest expense. As in prior years, a significant portion of the Company's non-interest expense was attributable to longstanding litigation related to the activities of Mr. Brian Davis, a former Bank customer who is now in prison for defrauding the Bank and other financial institutions. The Company also incurred a significant amount of legal and professional expense in connection with the attempted takeover of the Company by First Mariner Bancorp ("First Mariner"). By years' end, however, the Bank had resolved virtually all of the Brian Davis related litigation and the Company had entered into an agreement pursuant to which with First Mariner will cease its attempts to acquire control of the Company.  Forward-Looking Statements           When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words or phrases "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "estimate," "project" or similar expressions are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and to advise readers that various factors, including regional and national economic conditions, unfavorable judicial decisions, substantial changes in levels of market interest rates, credit and other risks of lending and investment activities and competitive and regulatory factors could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected.           The Company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.  Comparison of Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 1998, 1997  and 1996           General. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company reported consolidated net income of $833,192 ($0.78 basic and diluted earnings per share) compared to a consolidated net profit of $747,247 ($0.68 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 1997 and a consolidated net loss of $1,020,177 ($0.94 basic and diluted loss per share) for the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase in net income during the 1998 period was                                         19      principally attributable to the receipt of $1,126,077 in proceeds from insurance settlements during the year and the recapture into income of $500,000 in allowances for credit losses. These increases in income offset a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non-interest expense which included amounts paid in settlement of various litigation. Earnings per share for 1998 were favorably affected by a reduction in the number of shares outstanding after the Company repurchased 213,168 shares from First Mariner in November 1998. Weighted average shares outstanding for 1998 were 1,071,026 compared to 1,092,768 for 1997. The increase in net income during the 1997 period over the 1996 period was principally attributable to a reduction in the provision for credit losses to $270,000 from $6,596,000 in 1996.           Net Interest Income. The primary component of the Company's net income is its net interest income which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund them. Net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the Company's interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets, represents the Company's net interest margin.           Consolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 1998 was $9,793,550 compared to $10,567,211 for the year ended December 31, 1997 and $10,884,253 for the year ended December 31, 1996. The decrease in net interest income for the most recent year was primarily attributable to a significant decline in interest income which fell $1,587,696 (9.1%) for the year ended December 31, 1998. The decline in interest income was attributable primarily to a reduced average volume of earning assets and secondarily to a declining yield on assets. The most significant reductions in earning assets involved the investment securities portfolio. The Company has used the proceeds from maturing and called investment securities to cover deposit outflows. The Company also experienced a 66 basis point decline in the yield on the investment securities portfolio as the Company has shifted its investment securities portfolio into repricable GNMA securities from state, county and municipals. Interest expense declined $814,035, or 11.8%, for the year ended December 31, 1998. For the past several years, the Company's earnings performance has been impacted by a decline in earning assets and declining net interest margin. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 1998 was 4.94% compared to 5.09% for the year ended December 31, 1997. The Company expects additional pressure on its net interest margin as the result of its repurchase of 213,168 shares of its common stock in late 1998. Due to the repurchase, the Company will be required to fund a greater portion of its interest-earning assets with interest-bearing liabilities rather than equity.           Consolidated net interest income decreased by $317,032 (2.91%) to $10,567,211 in 1997 from $10,884,243 in 1996. The decrease in net interest income in 1997 was primarily due to lower interest income attributable to continued run-off of the loan portfolio. Interest expense declined $852,315, or 10.98%, for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to deposit outflows in 1997. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 1997 was 5.09% compared to 5.04% for the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase in the net interest margin for fiscal 1997 was primarily due to the loss of accrued interest on loans charged off during fiscal 1996.                                          20               The following table allocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Bank's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume. Changes due to rate/volume are allocated to changes due to  volume.

The incremental tax rate applied was 38.62%           for 1998, 37.42% for 1997 and 37.04% for 1996. (2)      Non-accrual loans included in average balance.           Provision for Credit Losses. During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company had a provision for credit losses of $(500,000) due to the recapture of loss allowances during the third quarter compared to $270,000 and $6,596,000 in provisions during the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The recapture of loss reserves reflects improved asset quality and lower charge-off activity during 1998. At December 31, 1998, the allowance for loan losses equaled 179.5% of non-accrual and past due loans compared to 118.7% and 109.2% at                                        22     December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $798,336 compared to $1,191,196 and $5,233,679 in net charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996. The higher provisions during fiscal years 1997 and 1996 reflect the amount determined by the Company to be necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses to an adequate level after significant increases in loan charge-offs during these years.           Other Income. Other income increased $1,394,555 (81%) during the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to the prior year period. The bulk of the increase in other income was attributable to $1,126,077 in proceeds from insurance settlements received during the year. Included in this figure was $1,125,000 received from the Bank's fidelity bond company in settlement of claims related to the activities of a former employee. The Company does not anticipate similar income during 1999. Other income during 1998 also benefitted from a $256,000, or 95%, increase in gains on sales and calls of investment securities. Other income for 1997 was lower than that recorded in 1996 because of $560,000 in insurance settlements received in 1996. The absence of such income during 1997 resulted in lower other income for the year notwithstanding improved income from other fees and commissions and higher gains on the sale of investment securities during 1997. In order to improve its interest rate sensitivity for fiscal 1998, the Bank sold $16.0 million in long-term, fixed-rate state, county and municipal securities which had been classified as available-for-sale and invested the proceeds in adjustable-rate, mortgage-backed securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA").           Other Expenses. Other expenses increased by $183,418 or 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 1998. Included in other expenses for 1998 were $1,225,003 in litigation charges, a $228,842, or 23%, increase over 1997. These charges related to the settlement of claims against the Bank in connection with payment of checks over fraudulent endorsements. Also included in other expenses are $2,163,448 in professional service fees relating primarily to the litigation in which the Company was involved during the year. With the settlement of most of the major litigation, the Company hopes to reduce these expenses in 1999. For the year ended December 1997, other expense increased by $2,573,983, or 28.5%, primarily due to $996,161 in litigation and restructuring charges including a $284,000 accrual for a judgment rendered against the Bank in the third quarter of 1997 and a $700,000 expense incurred in connection with the settlement of certain litigation during the second quarter. In addition, the Company experienced increases in other expenses due to professional fees incurred in connection with other litigation in which the Company was involved.           Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $806,247 compared to tax benefits of $315,284 and $1,480,192 during the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996. Due primarily to its holdings of tax-exempt state, county and municipal securities, the Company recorded tax losses during the 1997 and 1996 years. These net operating losses were applied to prior years' earnings resulting in tax benefits in each of the periods. During 1998, however, the Company reduced its holdings of tax-exempt state, county and municipal securities and reinvested the proceeds in U.S. Government agency securities the income on which is not exempt from federal taxation. Accordingly, the Company had taxable income during 1998 and was required to provide for federal income taxes. The Company's income tax expense for 1998 also included $351,738 in disallowed claims for refunds of prior years' state taxes. The Company does not anticipate similar tax expense during 1999 and accordingly expects a reduction in its effective tax rate.  Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996           The Company's total assets declined to $217,571,063 at December 31, 1998 after declining to $231,899,594 at December 31, 1997 from $254,324,701 at December 31, 1996. The reduction in assets during the year ended December 31, 1998 reflects a decline in the investment securities portfolio as the Company used the proceeds from maturing and called securities to fund deposit withdrawals. The reduction in assets during the year ended December 31, 1997 reflects a decline in the loan portfolio to $111,545,262 at December 31, 1997, net of allowances and unearned income, from $124,672,414 at December 31, 1996.           During 1998, the Company's loan portfolio grew to $125,501,252 at December 31, 1998 compared to $111,545,262 at December 31, 1997 and $124,672,414 at December 31, 1996. The growth in the loan portfolio was                                         23      attributable almost entirely to the Bank's indirect automobile lending program which was introduced in January 1998 and grew to $24,630,402, net of dealer reserves at December 31, 1998. The Bank's other loan portfolios held steady or declined during the year. The decline in the loan portfolio during 1997 was largely due to a decrease in commercial and industrial loans during the period. Commercial mortgage loans increased during the period while residential mortgages decreased slightly and lease financing and installment loans also decreased.           The Company's total investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity) totaled $65,485,827 at December 31, 1998, a $16,371,844 or 20.0%, decrease from $81,857,671 at December 31, 1997. The Company used the proceeds from maturing and called securities to fund deposit outflows during the period. During fiscal year 1997, the total investment securities portfolio declined by $14,716,000, or 15.2%, from $96,574,000 at December 31, 1996.           Deposits as of December 31, 1998 totaled $199,611,115, a decrease of $7,499,157 (3.6%) for the year. Demand deposits as of December 31, 1998 totaled $45,360,776, a $2,290,599 (4.8%) decrease from $47,651,375 at December 31, 1997. NOW accounts as of December 31, 1998 remained basically the same at $20,600,751. Money market accounts increased by $172,752 (0.9%) for the year to total $20,049,677 on December 31, 1998. Savings deposits decreased by $2,287,000, or 5.3%. Meanwhile, time deposits over $100,000 totaled $8,104,000 on December 31, 1998, an increase of $640,000 (8.6%) from December 31, 1997. Other time deposits (made up of certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and individual retirement accounts) totaled $64,413,000 on December 31, 1998, a $4,061,000 (5.9%) decrease from December 31, 1997.           The Company experienced a $4,795,917, or 25.3% decrease in total stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 1998. The decrease in stockholders' equity was attributable to the repurchase of 213,168 shares of common stock from First Mariner Bancorp for an aggregate purchase price of $5,580,764 in November 1998. The Company experienced a $378,220, or 2%, increase in total stockholders' equity during the year ended December 31, 1997 as net income during the period offset a decline in net unrealized appreciation on securities available for sale resulting from the disposition of certain available-for-sale securities. Surplus steadily increased, rising $382,153 (6.2%) during 1997 to $6,575,053. The increase in the surplus account was primarily a result of the reinvestment of dividends pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the payment of three one-percent stock dividends in lieu of cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 1997.  Asset/Liability Management           Net interest income, the primary component of the Company's net income, arises from the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. The Company manages its assets and liabilities by coordinating the levels of and gap between interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize changes in net interest income and in the economic value of its equity despite changes in market interest rates. The Bank's Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee meets on a monthly basis to monitor compliance with the Board's objectives. Among other tools used by the Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee to monitor interest rate risk is a "gap" report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing within a given time period. Generally, during a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap position would adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income, while, conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income.           During recent periods, the Company has maintained a negative gap position that has benefitted earnings as interest rates have fallen. In order to reduce its negative gap position, the Company has recently begun investing in mortgage-backed and other government securities which have rates that adjust to market rates. The Company also maintains a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities that can be quickly converted to more liquid assets if needed.                                          24               The following table sets forth the Bank's interest-rate sensitivity at December 31, 1998.

(31.4)%           (28.4)%         (10.0)%            21.8%             The foregoing analysis assumes that the Bank's assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity. Mortgage-backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts are presumed to reprice at maturity. NOW savings accounts are assumed to reprice within three months although it is the Company's experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates.  Liquidity and Capital Resources           The Company currently has no business other than that of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.           The Bank's principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income, deposits from its primary market area, principal and interest payments on loans, interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities. Its principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits. Deposits are considered a primary source of funds supporting the Bank's lending and investment activities.           The Bank's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, federal funds sold and money market mutual funds. The levels of such assets are dependent on                                         25      the Bank's operating financing and investment activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows.           Cash and cash equivalents (cash due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold), as of December 31, 1998, totaled $16,019,316, an decrease of $12,517,295 (43.9%) from the December 31, 1997 total of $28,536,611. Most of this decrease was in Federal funds sold which totaled $2,863,635 at December 31, 1998 compared to $18,850,000 at the end of 1997. The larger balance in Federal funds sold at the end of 1997 reflects a decision to increase liquid assets in order to fund January securities purchase commitments.           The Bank may draw on a $26,000,000 line of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. Borrowings under the line are secured by a lien on the Bank's residential mortgage loans. As of December 31, 1998, $1.0 million was outstanding under this line. In addition the Bank has a secured line of credit in the amount of $5.0 million from another commercial bank.  Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure           As the year 2000 approaches, an important business issue has emerged regarding how existing application software programs and operating systems can accommodate this date value. For many years, software applications routinely conserved magnetic storage space by using only two digits to record calendar years; for example, the year 1999 is stored as "99". On January 1, 2000, the calendars in many software applications will change from "99" to "00". Many of these software applications, in their current form, will produce erroneous results or will fail to run at all since their logic cannot deal with this transaction.           The Company's Year 2000 plan calls for the identification of all systems that could be affected by Year 2000 problem, the systematic assessment of their Year 2000 readiness and the institution of appropriate remedial measures and contingency planning. As part of its Year 2000 plan, the Company has ranked its various computer systems according to their importance to the continued functioning of the Bank. Assessment procedures range from actual testing for the Company's most mission critical systems to seeking written self assessments from individual borrowers. Based on these assessments, the Company has instituted appropriate remedial measures which include software upgrades and the replacement of vendors and hardware where necessary. The Company's Year 2000 plan includes contingency and back-up plans for mission critical systems.           The Company's mainframe computer hardware and systems software are Year 2000 compliant. The Company primarily utilizes third-party vendor application software for all computer applications. The third-party vendors for the Company's banking applications are in the process of modifying, upgrading or replacing their computer applications to insure Year 2000 compliance. In addition, the Company has instituted a Year 2000 compliance program whereby the Company is reviewing the Year 2000 compliance issues that may be faced by its third-party vendors. Under such program, the Company will examine the need for modifications or replacement of all non-Year 2000 compliant pieces of software. The Company has spent approximately $400,000 in 1997 and 1998 to upgrade certain hardware and software and believes the cost of its Year 2000 compliance program will not be material to its financial condition. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with its Year 2000 plan at year end 1998. In the event of unforseen disruptions with Year 2000 compliance, the Company business operations could be adversely affected.  Item 7A.
