Total interest incomedecreased from $13,605,649 in 2015 to $13,281,390 in 2016, a 2.38% decrease. Interest expense for 2016 totaled $2,123,362, an 11.19%decrease from $2,390,685 in 2015. In spite of the impact the low interest rate environment had on net interest margin, the Companyrealized consolidated net income of $1,100,720 for 2016 by decreasing interest expense by $267,323 and by decreasing the provisionfor loan loss by $826,658 .     The Federal Reserveended their aggressive Quantitative Easing program and is monitoring the rates of growth, unemployment, and inflation to whichthey expect the national economy to converge over time in the absence of further shocks and under appropriate monetary policy.During December 2016, the Federal Reserve continued its assertion that the national economy has shown considerable strength anddecided to raise the Federal Funds rate, further stating that it anticipates the pace of tightening to be gradual. Through thiseasing period, we experienced a decrease in outstanding loans and deposits while continuing to serve the needs of the communitieswe serve.     Comparison of Results of Operationsfor the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015     General.  Forthe year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported consolidated net income of $1,100,720 ($0.40 basic and diluted earningsper share) compared to consolidated net income of $1,352,616 ($0.49 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December31, 2015 and consolidated net income of $1,914,526 ($0.69 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31,2014. The decrease in the 2016 consolidated net income was mainly due to decreases in loan income, a decrease in state and municipalsecurity income, a decrease in gains on investment securities and an increase in salaries and wages and other expenses. This waspartially offset by an increase in U.S. Government securities income, a decrease in deposit expense and a decrease in employeebenefits. The decrease in the 2015 consolidated net income was mainly due to decreases in loan income, a decrease in state andmunicipal security income, and an increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in other fees and commissionincome (due to the gain on the sale of insurance policies), and a decrease in deposit expense and other expenses.     Net Interest Income. The primary component of the Company’s net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earnedon assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets. Net interest income is determinedby the spread between the yields earned on the Company’s interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilitiesas well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets,represents the Company’s net interest margin.     Net interest incomeis affected by the mix of loans in the Bank’s loan portfolio. Currently a majority of the Bank’s loans are residentialand commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate and indirect automobile loans secured by automobiles.     Consolidated net interestincome for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $11,158,028 compared to $11,214,964 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $11,985,815for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $56,936 decrease for the most recent year was primarily due to the decline in interestincome on loans being greater than the decline in interest expense on deposits. The $770,851 decrease for 2015 was primarily dueto the decline in interest income on loans and securities being greater than the decline in interest expense on deposits. The netinterest income, on a tax equivalent basis, for 2016 was $11,753,000, a $165,000 or 1.38% decrease from the tax equivalent basisnet interest income for 2015, which was $11,918,000, a $778,000 or 6.13% decrease from the tax equivalent basis net interest incomefor 2014.         20           Interest expense decreasedfrom $2,390,685 in 2015 to $2,123,362 in 2016, a $267,323 or an 11.19% decrease, primarily due to a decrease in average depositsas well as a decrease in our cost of deposits. Interest expense decreased from $2,533,922 in 2014 to $2,390,685 in 2015, a $143,237or a 5.66% decrease, primarily due to a decrease in average deposits as well as a decrease in our cost of deposits. Net interestmargin for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 3.17% compared to 3.16% and 3.50% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,respectively.     The following tableallocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilitiesfor the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company made a provision of $868,342 for credit losses, compared to aprovision of $1,695,000 and $1,021,000 for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively .  In2016, the Bank decreased its provision for credit losses compared to prior periods as specifically reserved, impaired loans wereresolved. A single borrower in collection proceedings with 10 residential real estate loans in non-accrual status had the balanceof specific reserves applied in prior years, partially charged off in March 2016, leaving one of the loans with a specific reserveat December 31, 2016. In October and November 2016, a commercial real estate loan with specific reserves of $201,000 was movedto non-accrual status, subsequently charged-off when the Bank foreclosed on the collateral property. In December, a commercialreal estate loan evaluated to be collateral impaired had a new specific reserve added to the provision balance for $236,011. AtDecember 31, 2016, the allowance for credit losses equaled 65.59% of non-accrual and past due loans compared to 82.14% and 104.84%at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $1,534,000compared to $1,663,000 and $875,000 in net charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.         22           Other Income. Other income includes service charges on deposit accounts, other fees and commissions, net gains on investment securities, andincome on Bank owned life insurance (BOLI). Other income decreased from $3,008,070 in 2015 to $1,629,615 in 2016, a $1,378,455,or 45.83% decrease. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other fees and commissions (due to the income of $421,067 onthe sale of insurance policies during the third quarter of 2015), a decrease in the gains on investment securities, offset by thegain on the two BOLI policies (redemption of two policies for a former employee). Other income increased from $2,670,498 in 2014to $3,008,070 in 2015, a $337,582, or 12.64% increase. The increase was primarily due to an increase in other fees and commissionsdue to the income of $421,067 on the sale of insurance policies during the third quarter of 2015.     Other Expenses.  Other expenses, which consist of non-interest operating expenses, decreased from $10,930,497 in 2015 to $10,901,645 in 2016,a $28,852 or 0.26% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in employee benefits, marketing expenses, telephoneexpenses, legal expenses, and collection expense. These decreases were offset by various increases in other areas, such as professionalexpenses, other ATM expenses, and the provision in OREO loss expense .  Other expenses decreased from $11,412,259 in 2014to $10,930,497 in 2015, a $481,762 or 4.22% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other expenses because ofa reduction in marketing expenses, in salaries and wages, employee benefits, occupancy expense, and the reversal of the reservefor unfunded commitments during the fourth quarter of 2015 of $188,233, offset by increases in the other categories.     Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an income tax credit of ( $ 83,064), compared to an income taxexpense of $244,921 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net income beforetaxes and the large amount of tax exempt interest income recognized during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2015,the Company recorded an income tax expense of $244,921, compared to an income tax expense of $308,652 for the year ended December31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net income before taxes.     Comparison of Financial Conditionat December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014     The Company’stotal assets decreased to $388,431,995 at December 31, 2016 from $390,580,191 at December 31, 2015. The Company’s total assetsdecreased to $390,580,191 at December 31, 2015 from $394,629,508 at December 31, 2014.     The Company’snet loan portfolio increased to $262,573,603 at December 31, 2016 compared to $259,636,706 at December 31, 2015 and $273,986,237at December 31, 2014. In 2016, the increase in the loan portfolio was primarily due to an increase in indirect loans and commercialand industrial mortgages with lesser increases in other areas. This was offset primarily by a decrease in refinance mortgages andlesser decreases in other areas. In 2015, the decrease in the loan portfolio was primarily due to decreases in indirect loans,purchase money mortgage and refinance loans with lesser decreases in other areas. These decreases were partially offset by increasesin home equity loans and commercial and industrial loans with lesser increases in other areas. In 2015, mortgage participationssold also increased. In 2014, the increase in the loan portfolio was primarily due to increases in indirect loans, purchase moneymortgage, and commercial and industrial construction loans, partially offset by decreases in refinance mortgage loans and commercialand industrial mortgages.     During 2016, the Company’stotal investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held tomaturity) totaled $94,606,576, a $4,183,434 or 4.23%, decrease from $98,790,010 at December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarilydue to the pay-down of mortgage backed securities. During 2015, the Company’s total investment securities portfolio (includingboth investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity) totaled $98,790,010, a $10,796,865 or12.27%, increase from $87,993,145 at December 31, 2014. This increase was due to investing excess liquidity, which led to an increasein U. S. Government agencies and mortgage backed securities, offset by decreases in U. S. Treasury securities and state and municipalsecurities. The market value of municipal securities also increased from 2013 to 2014 and contributed to this increase.     Depositsas of December 31, 2016 totaled $333,237,328, a decrease of $1,954,202, or 0.59%, from the $335,191,530 total as of December 31,2015. Deposits as of December 31, 2015 totaled $335,191,530, a decrease of $3,685,762, or 1.09%, from the $338,877,292 total asof December 31, 2014. Demand deposits as of December 31, 2016 totaled $100,089,967, a $6,505,103, or 6.95%, increase from $93,584,864at December 31, 2015 .  NOW and Super NOW accounts, as of December 31, 2016, increased by$1,910,630, or 6.95% from their 2015 level to $29,412,646. Money market accounts decreased by $723,960, or 3.79%, from their 2015level, to total $18,355,576 at December 31, 2016. Savings deposits increased by $1,993,650, or 2.56%, from their 2015 level, to$80,006,504 at December 31, 2016. Time deposits over $100,000 totaled $46,879,404 on December 31, 2016, a decrease of $4,282,625,or 8.37% from December 31, 2015. Other time deposits (made up of certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and individual retirementaccounts) totaled $58,493,231 on December 31, 2016, a $6,896,346 or 10.55% decrease from December 31, 2015.     Total stockholders’equity as of December 31, 2016 decreased by $361,624, or 1.062%, from the 2015 period. The decrease was attributed to the slightdecrease in retained earnings of $10,587, as a result of 101% of net income paid out in dividends and the accumulated other comprehensiveloss in 2016 (a $508,323 change). Total stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2015 increased by $345,286, or 1.02%, fromthe 2014 period. The increase was attributed to the increase in retained earnings of $605,408, offset by the accumulated othercomprehensive income in 2014 now being a loss (a $404,464 change) and by cash dividends paid, net of dividends reinvested.         23           Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     Off-Balance SheetArrangements.  The Bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs ofits customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, tovarying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.     Loan commitments andlines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts. Loan commitmentsgenerally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts, fixed expiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Linesof credit generally have variable interest rates. Many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire withoutbeing drawn upon; accordingly, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluateseach customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral or other security obtained, if deemednecessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but mayinclude deposits held in financial institutions, U.S. Treasury securities, other marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory,property and equipment, personal residences, income-producing commercial properties, and land under development. Personal guaranteesare also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments.     Letters of credit areconditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarilyissued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuingletters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds collateraland obtains personal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary.     The Bank’s exposureto credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment.     Currently, we break-out our unfunded commitmentsinto the following categories:    o Unfunded Construction commitments   o Unfunded Commercial lines of credit and other   o Unfunded Home Equity LOC   o Unfunded Demand Deposit overdraft LOC   o Committed Loans which have not closed   o Letters of Credit     During 2015, we revised the calculationsfor the following categories:    o Unfunded Commercial lines of credit and other – reduce reserve percentage to zero based onhistorical loss ratios and the Bank’s sole discretion on future funding of any specific account (customer must request fundingand the Bank does not have to fund the request if we deem the account is no longer worthy of continued funding; we freeze all fundingof accounts that are past due and/or in non-accrual status.)   o Unfunded Home Equity LOC – reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historical loss ratiosand the Bank’s ability to freeze any account based on activity of the account or information which the Bank may obtain suchas a drastic decline in collateral value.   o Unfunded Demand Deposit overdraft LOC – reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historicalloss ratios.     We did not change the calculations for theother categories even though we have similar rights as those categories above for the following reasons:      o Constructions loans – we have the sole discretion to fund these requests, however not fundinga construction request can have a material negative impact of our collateral value and therefore we will continue to allocate reservesfor the unfunded amounts using the same loss ratio as the funded portion of the portfolio.   o Committed Loans which have not closed – we have the sole discretion to not fund these loansshould material adverse information become known to the Bank, however we are typically near the final stages of our due diligenceunderwriting of the loan and feel we have similar loss exposure as already funded loans therefore will continue to use the sameloss ratio as funded loans.   o Letters of Credit – in most instances, we must fund the Letter of Credit if such a requestis made and do not have the sole discretion as we do for other categories.         24           Loancommitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including collateral, as outstanding loans. Asof December 31, 2016, the Bank has accrued $24,794, an increase of $13,027 from 2015, for unfunded commitments related to thesefinancial instruments with off balance sheet risk, which is included in other liabilities. The additional provision amount is includedin ‘other expense’.     Market Risk Management     Market risk is therisk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchangerates or equity pricing. The Company’s principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from its lending, investingand deposit taking activities. The Company’s profitability is dependent on the Bank’s net interest income. Interestrate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at differentintervals than interest earning assets. The Bank’s Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee oversees the managementof interest rate risk. The primary purpose of the committee is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changesdue to interest rate fluctuations. The Company does not utilize derivative financial or commodity instruments or hedging strategiesin its management of interest rate risk. The primary tool used by the committee to monitor interest rate risk is a “gap”report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities subjectto repricing within a given time period. These efforts affect the loan pricing and deposit rate policies of the Company as wellas the asset mix, volume guidelines, and liquidity and capital planning.     The following tablesets forth the Bank’s interest-rate sensitivity at December 31, 2016.                          Over 1                               Over 3 to      Through      Over                 0-3 Months      12 Months      5 Years      5 Years      Total          (Dollars in Thousands)     Assets:                                                Cash and due from banks    $ -      $ -      $ -      $ -      $ 7,425     Federal funds and overnight deposits      3,197        -        -        -        3,197     Securities      -        -        1,507        93,100        94,607     Loans      2,070        13,690        72,319        174,495        262,574     Fixed assets      -        -        -        -        3,323     Other assets      -        -        -        -        17,306                                                      Total assets    $ 5,267      $ 13,690      $ 73,826      $ 267,595      $ 388,432                                                      Liabilities:                                                Demand deposit accounts    $ -      $ -      $ -      $ -      $ 100,090     NOW accounts      29,413        -        -        -        29,413     Money market deposit accounts      18,356        -        -        -        18,356     Savings accounts      80,006        -        -        -        80,006     IRA accounts      1,872        6,678        26,278        812        35,640     Certificates of deposit      6,072        18,750        44,695        215        69,732     Long-term borrowings      -        10,000        10,000        -        20,000     Other liabilities      -        -        -        -        1,381     Stockholders’ equity:      -        -        -        -        33,814                                                      Total liabilities and stockholders' equity    $ 135,719      $ 35,428      $ 80,973      $ 1,027      $ 388,432                                                      GAP    $ (130,452 )    $ (21,738 )    $ (7,147 )    $ 266,568              Cumulative GAP    $ (130,452 )    $ (152,190 )    $ (159,337 )    $ 107,231              Cumulative GAP as a % of total assets      -33.58 %      -39.18 %      -41.02 %      27.61 %                   25           The foregoinganalysis assumes that the Bank’s assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based onfinal maturity. Mortgage backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and itis assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts are presumedto reprice at maturity. NOW savings accounts are assumed to reprice at within three months although it is the Company’s experiencethat such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates.     In addition to gapanalysis, the Bank utilizes a simulation model to quantify the effect a hypothetical immediate plus or minus 200 basis point changein rates would have on net interest income and the economic value of equity. The model takes into consideration the effect of callfeatures of investments as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates. When actual changes in interest rates occur,the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model and,in the Bank’s experience, the changes historically realized have been narrower than those projected by the model. However,the Bank believes that the model is a prudent forecasting tool. As of December 31, 2016, the model produced the following sensitivityprofile for net interest income and the economic value of equity.            Immediate Change in Rates          -200      -100      +100      +200          Basis Points      Basis Points      Basis Points      Basis Points                                     % Change in Net Interest Income      -16.1 %      -7.5 %      5.0 %      9.4 %   % Change in Economic Value of Equity      -15.4 %      -2.1 %      -2.5 %      -12.0 %      Inasmuch as a largeportion of the Company’s deposits are non-interest bearing in an increased interest rate environment the Company’sinterest income increases at a proportionally greater rate than its total interest expense, thereby resulting in higher net interestincome.  Conversely, in a declining interest rate environment the decreases in the Company’s interest income will begreater than decreases in its already low interest expense, thereby resulting in lower net interest income.  The Company’seconomic value of equity has a positive effect in an increased interest rate environment for shocks of 200 basis points and lessbecause the increase in economic value of the Company’s liabilities is greater than the decline in value of the Company’sassets because the liabilities reprice much slower than our assets, especially considering our interest earning assets are muchgreater than our interest bearing liabilities.  For an interest rate shock of 300 basis points economic and above produceresults whereby the change in economic value of equity is worse.  The Company’s economic value of equity worsens indeclining interest rate environments as the majority of our liabilities cannot continue to decrease much from their current levelsthus the economic value of our liabilities and our assets both worsen in a declining rate environment.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     The Company currentlyhas no business other than that of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments. The Company’s principalsources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictionson the payment of dividends.     The Bank’s principalsources of funds for investments and operations are net income, deposits from its primary market area, principal and interest paymentson loans, interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities. Its principal funding commitmentsare for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits. Deposits are considered the primary source offunds supporting the Bank’s lending and investment activities. The Bank also uses borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta tosupplement deposits, residential and small business lending, and to meet specific and anticipated needs.     The Bank’s mostliquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, federal funds soldand money market mutual funds. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank’s operating financing and investment activitiesat any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated futuredeposit flows.     Cash and cash equivalents(cash due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold), as of December 31, 2016,totaled $10,622,162, a decrease of $1,749,246 or 14.14%, from the December 31, 2015 total of $12,371,408. This decrease was dueto the normal inflows and outflow of deposits and loans and fluctuations on a daily basis.     As of December 31,2016, the Bank was permitted to draw on a $65.62 million line of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta. Borrowings under the line aresecured by a floating lien on the Bank’s residential first mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2015, there was nothing outstandingunder the daily rate credit. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had a $10 million convertible advance (callable monthly and witha final maturity of November 1, 2017) from the FHLB of Atlanta. This advance has a 3.28% rate of interest. In addition, the Bankhad a $5 million convertible advance settled July 21, 2008 with a final maturity of July 23, 2018. This advance has a 2.73% rateof interest and is callable quarterly. Furthermore, the Bank had a $5 million convertible advance taken out August 22, 2008 whichhas a final maturity of August 22, 2018. This advance has a 3.34% rate of interest and is callable quarterly .  In addition,the Bank has three unsecured lines of credit totaling $3 million, $5 million, and $8 million, on which there were no outstandingbalances at December 31, 2016.         26           Federal banking regulationsrequire the Company and the Bank to maintain specified levels of capital. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance withthese requirements with a leverage ratio of 8.74%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.74%, a total risk-based capital ratioof 14.74% and a common equity tier I capital of 13.74%. At December 31, 2016, the Bank met the criteria for designation as a wellcapitalized depository institution under FDIC regulations.     Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices     The consolidated financialstatements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, whichrequire the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changesin the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company’sassets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company’s performancethan do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the sameextent as the prices of goods and services.     Critical Accounting Policies     The Company’saccounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, starting on pageF-8 and are essential to understanding Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.As discussed there, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in theU.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financialstatements and accompanying notes. Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the determinationof estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessaryto value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to bereasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to thefinancial statements. The Company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change. Historically, actual results havenot differed significantly from the Company’s estimates. The following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimatesand principles involved in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, including the identification of the variablesmost important in the estimation process:     Allowance for CreditLosses.  The Bank’s allowance for credit losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actualevents occur, including historical losses as an indicator of future losses, fair market value of collateral, and various generalor industry or geographic specific economic events.  The use of these estimates and values is inherently subjective and theactual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.  For further information regarding our allowance for credit losses,see “Allowance for Credit Losses” under Item 1- “Business” of this Annual Report and Note 4 to the consolidatedfinancial statements.     Accrued Taxes. Management estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities. Income taxes are discussedin more detail in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to bereceived from taxing authorities. In estimating accrued taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriatetax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company’stax position.     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements       ASU 2013-08,“Financial Services – Investment Companies (Topic 946) – Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and DisclosureRequirements.” ASU 2013-08 clarifies the characteristics of investment companies and sets forth a new approachfor determining whether a company is an investment company.

Previously, such amounts were recorded in the pool of excess taxbenefits included in additional paid-in capital, if such pool was available. Because excess tax benefits are no longer recognizedin additional paid-in capital, the assumed proceeds from applying the treasury stock method when computing earnings per share shouldexclude the amount of excess tax benefits that would have previously been recognized in additional paid-in capital. Additionally,excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity rather than a financingactivity, as was previously the case. ASU 2016-09 also provides that an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy electionto either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur.
