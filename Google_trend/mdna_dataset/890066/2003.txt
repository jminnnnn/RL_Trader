ITEM 7 .  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Overview        During 2002, the Company continued many favorable operating trends. Most notably, the Banks net income grew from $1,725,000 in 2001 to $2,811,000 in 2002, a 62.9% increase in net income. In addition, 2002 saw significant growth in both the Banks deposits and investment portfolio. Deposit growth in 2002 was strong with increases of $8,736,020 in interest bearing deposits and $3,376,869 in non-interest bearing demand deposits. Investment portfolio growth was due primarily to the increase in the Banks investment in state and municipal bonds which had grown to $31,899,000 by the end of 2002.

The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and readers are advised that various factors, including regional and national economic conditions, unfavorable judicial decisions, substantial changes in levels of market interest rates, credit and other risks of lending and investment activities and competitive and regulatory factors could affect the Companys financial performance and could cause the Companys actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected.       The Company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.  Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000         General.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company reported consolidated net income of $2,811,083 ($1.68 basic and diluted earnings per share) compared to consolidated net income of $1,725,236 ($1.04 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2001 and consolidated net income of $2,274,866 ($1.38 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2000. (All per share amounts throughout this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to a six-for-five stock split effected through a stock dividend paid on January 11, 2000 and a three-for-two stock split effected through a stock dividend paid on June 21, 2001.) Income for 2000 included a $490,000 gain on foreclosed real estate and a non-recurring settlement gain of $1,600,126 on the termination of the Banks pension plan. Net income for 2000, adjusted to remove the effects of these items, net of taxes, was $991,947. Income for 2002 included a $763,644 curtailment gain on a post retirement benefit plan amendment. Net income for 2002, adjusted to remove the effects of this item, net of taxes, was $2,342,358.        Net Interest Income.  The primary component of the Companys net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund them. Net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the Companys interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets, represents the Companys net interest margin.       Consolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $11,368,150 compared to $10,673,730 for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $10,801,098 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The $694,420 increase for the most recent year was due to a decrease in the interest expense on deposits combined with an increase in interest income on state and municipal securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest income on loans. The $127,368 decrease in net interest income for 2001 as compared to 2000 was due to a decline in interest income on loans combined with an increase in interest expense for long-term borrowings and junior subordinated debentures, partially offset by increased interest income on state and municipal securities and corporate trust preferred securities. Since a large portion of the Companys portfolio is invested in state and municipal securities,  -20-          which are tax advantaged, the after tax net interest income for 2002 was $11,886,144, a $827,939 or 7.49% increase over the $11,058,205 after tax net interest income for 2001. The after tax net interest income for 2001 was $11,058,205, compared to $10,884,430 for 2000, an increase of $173,775 or 1.60%.       Interest expense decreased from $6,533,274 in 2001 to $5,202,132 in 2002, a $1,331,142, or 20.4% decrease, primarily due to decreases in interest rates. Interest expense increased from $5,901,617 in 2000 to $6,533,274 in 2001, a $631,657 or 10.7% increase, primarily due to the trust preferred issuance and the FHLB long-term borrowing in September, 2000. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 4.76% compared to 4.80% and 5.27% for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.       The following table allocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Companys interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume. Changes due to rate/volume are allocated to changes due to volume.

The incremental tax rate applied was 30.73% for 2002 and 34.38% for 2001.                       2 Non-accrual loans included in average balance.          Provision For Credit Losses.  During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company made no provision for credit losses compared to a negative $150,000 provision during the year ended December 31, 2001 and no provision during the year ended December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2002, the allowance for loan losses equaled 429.13% of non-accrual and past due loans compared to 445.30% and 837.87% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded net chargeoffs of $423,755 compared to $296,360 and $463,184 in net charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  -22-             Other Income.  Other income increased from $1,821,138 in 2001 to $2,484,725 in 2002, a $663,587, or 36.4% increase. The increase was largely due to the non-recurring curtailment gain of $763,644 on a post retirement benefit plan amendment partially offset by a decrease in securities gains realized, income from service charges on deposit accounts and other fees and commissions also increased. Other income decreased from $3,657,878 in 2000 to $1,821,138 in 2001, a $1,836,740, or 50.2% decrease. The decrease was largely due to a $490,000 gain on foreclosed real estate and a non-recurring settlement gain of $1,600,126 on the termination of the Banks pension plan in 2000 which were not present in 2001, partially offset by a gain on investment securities of $273,003 in 2001.        Other Expenses.  Other expenses decreased from $10,332,093 in 2001 to $9,956,847 in 2002, a $375,246 or 3.6% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in other operating expenses and employee benefit costs, which were partially offset by an increase in salaries and wages. Other expenses decreased from $10,746,049 in 2000 to $10,332,093 in 2001, a $413,956 or 3.85% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in employee benefit expense, which relates to the termination of the Banks defined benefit retirement plan.        Income Taxes.  During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded income tax expense of $1,084,945, compared to income tax expense of $587,539 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in income tax expense for 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to the curtailment gain on post retirement benefits and an increase in net interest income partially offset by the tax benefits from the Companies increased investment in state and municipal securities. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded income tax expense of $587,539, compared to income tax expense of $1,438,061 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Part of the 2000 period income tax expense was due to nonrecurring income realized in 2000 and was offset, in part, by the tax benefits from the Companys investments in state and municipal securities. The decreased income tax expense for 2001 was due to a decline in pretax income and increased investments in state and municipal securities.  Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000        The Companys total assets increased to $279,406,206 at December 31, 2002 from $263,361,726 at December 31, 2001. The increase in assets during the year ended December 31, 2002 is a result primarily of growth in investment securities and other assets partially offset by a decrease in the loan portfolio. The Companys total assets increased to $263,361,726 at December 31, 2001 from $239,211,180 at December 31, 2000. The increase in assets during the year ended December 31, 2001 is a result primarily of growth in the investment portfolio.       The Companys loan portfolio declined to $158,286,746 at December 31, 2002 compared to $164,569,252 at December 31, 2001 and $162,373,731 at December 31, 2000. The decline in the loan portfolio during the 2002 period is attributable almost entirely to a decrease in the indirect automobile portfolio. The growth in the loan portfolio during the 2001 period is primarily attributable to growth in residential mortgages, partially offset by a decrease in commercial mortgages and indirect automobile lending. The decrease in indirect automobile lending can be at least partially attributed to zero percent financing offered by automobile manufacturers since September 2001.       During 2002, the Companys total investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity) totaled $91,860,051, a $19,795,130 or 27.5%, increase from $72,064,921 at December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily attributable to growth in mortgage backed and state and municipal securities, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Government agency securities. During 2001, the Companys total investment securities portfolio totaled $72,064,921, a $19,470,023 or 37%, increase from $52,594,898 at December 31, 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to the use of increased deposits to increase the Banks investment in mortgage backed securities and state, county and municipal securities, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. governmental agency securities.       Deposits as of December 31, 2002 totaled $241,419,607, an increase of $12,112,890, or 5.3%, from the $229,306,717 total as of December 31, 2001. The $229,306,717 in total deposits as of December 31, 2001 was a $23,338,380 or 11.3% increase from the $205,968,337 total deposits as of December 31, 2000. Demand deposits as of December 31, 2002 totaled $59,061,977, a $3,376,869 or 6.1% increase from $55,685,108 at December 31, 2001. NOW and Super NOW accounts as of December 31, 2002 increased by $1,675,470 or 7.5% from their 2001 level to $24,071,173. Money market accounts decreased by $736,522 or 3.6%, from their 2001 level to total $19,889,727  -23-          December 31, 2002. Savings deposits increased by $5,271,207 or 12.4% from their 2001 level, to $47,616,167 at December 31, 2002. Time deposits over $100,000 totaled $17,698,559 on December 31, 2002, an increase of $63,093, or 0.3% from December 31, 2001. Other time deposits (made up of certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and individual retirement accounts) totaled $73,082,004 on December 31, 2002, a $2,462,772 or a 3.5%, increase from December 31, 2001.       Total stockholders equity as of December 31, 2002 increased by $3,927,801 or 22.0% from the 2001 period. The increase was attributed to an increase in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Total stockholders equity as of December 31, 2001 increased by $680,838 or 3.96% from the 2000 period. The increase was attributed to an increase in outstanding common stock and retained earnings, offset by a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.  Asset/Liability Management        Net interest income, the primary component of the Companys net income, arises from the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. The Company manages its assets and liabilities by coordinating the levels of and gap between interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize changes in net interest income and in the economic value of its equity despite changes in market interest rates. The Banks Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee meets on a monthly basis to monitor compliance with the Boards objectives. Among other tools used by the Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee to monitor interest rate risk is a gap report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing within a given time period. Generally, during a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap position would adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income, while, conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income.       During recent periods, the Company has maintained a negative gap position that has benefited earnings as interest rates have fallen. In order to reduce its negative gap position, the Company has recently begun investing in mortgage-backed and other government securities which have rates that adjust to market rates. The Company also maintains a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities that can be quickly converted to more liquid assets if needed.  -24-       The following table sets forth the Banks interest-rate sensitivity at December 31, 2002.                                                                                                                                                                    Over 3 To         Over 1         Over 5                                              0-3 Months         12 Months         Through 5Years         Years         Total                                                                                   (Dollars In Thousands)      Assets:                                                                                                                Cash and due from banks         $                  $                  $                  $                  $    11,297                 Federal funds and overnight deposits              4,445                                                                                              Securities              100                   1,299                   12,434                   78,730                   92,663                 Loans              12,199                   2,665                   75,823                   70,115                   160,802                 Fixed Assets                                                                                          4,143                 Other Assets                                                                                          5,123                                                                                                                         Total assets         $    16,744              $    3,964              $    88,257              $    148,945              $    278,473                                                                                                               Liabilities:                                                                                                                Demand deposit accounts         $                  $                  $                  $                  $    59,062                 NOW accounts              24,071                                                                            24,071                 Money market deposit accounts              19,890                                                                            19,890                 Savings accounts              47,616                   1,428                                                         49,044                 IRA accounts              2,319                   6,372                   11,410                   1,689                   21,790                 Certificates of deposit              15,888                   26,739                   24,459                   476                   67,563                 Other liabilities                                                                                          10,109                 Junior Subordinated Debenture                                                                                          5,155                      Stockholders equity                                                                                          21,782                                                                                                                         Total liabilities and Stockholders equity         $    109,784              $    34,539              $    35,869              $    2,165              $    278,473                                                                                                                GAP         $    (93,040    )         $    (30,575    )         $    52,388              $    146,780                                Cumulative GAP              (93,040    )              (123,615    )              (71,227    )              75,553                                Cumulative GAP as a % of total assets              (33.41%    )              (44.39%    )              (25.58%    )              27.13%                                   The foregoing analysis assumes that the Banks assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity. Mortgage-backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts are presumed to reprice at maturity. NOW savings accounts are assumed to reprice within three months although it is the Companys experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates.  Liquidity and Capital Resources        The Company currently has no business other than that of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments. The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.       The Banks principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income, deposits from its primary market area, principal and interest payments on loans, interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities. Its principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits. Deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the Banks lending and investment activities. The Bank also uses borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta to supplement deposits, residential and small business lending, and to meet specific and anticipated needs.       The Banks most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, federal funds sold and money market mutual funds. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Banks operating financing and investment activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows.       Cash and cash equivalents (cash due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold), as of December 31, 2002, totaled $15,742,088, a decrease of $2,478,740 or 13.6%, from the December 31, 2001 total of $18,220,828. Most of this decrease was due to a decline in deposits in other financial institutions and a reduction in federal funds sold.  -25-            As of December 31, 2002, the Bank was permitted to draw on a $33.4 million line of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta. Borrowings under the line are secured by a floating lien on the Banks residential mortgage loans and its portfolio of U.S. Government and Agency Securities. As of December 31, 2002, a $7 million long-term convertible advance was outstanding under this line. In addition the Bank has a secured line of credit in the amount of  $ 5 million from another commercial bank on which it has not drawn. Furthermore, on September 7, 2000, the Company issued $5,155,000 of its 10.6% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures to Glen Burnie Statutory Trust I, a Connecticut statutory trust wholly owned by the Company. The Trust, in turn, issued $5,000,000 of its 10.6% capital securities to institutional investors. The debentures are scheduled to mature on September 7, 2030, unless called by the Company not earlier than September 7, 2010. As of December 31, 2002, the full $5,155,000 was outstanding.       Federal banking regulations require the Company and the Bank to maintain specified levels of capital. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with these requirements with a leverage ratio of 9.1%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.0% and total risk-based capital ratio of 15.3%. At December 31, 2002, the Bank met the criteria for designation as a well capitalized depository institution under FDIC regulations.  Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices        The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Companys assets and liabilities are monetary in mature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Companys performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.  Critical Accounting Policies        The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, starting on page F-8 and are essential to understanding Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As discussed there, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The Company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change. Historically, actual results have not differed significantly from the Companys estimates. The following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimates and principles involved in the preparation of the Companys financial statements, including the identification of the variables most important in the estimation process:        Allowance for Credit Losses.  The allowance for credit losses is managements best estimate of the probable incurred credit losses in the lending portfolio. The Company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to identify and estimate the inherent risks and assess overall collectibility. These reviews include loss forecast modeling based on historical experiences and current events and conditions as well as individual loan valuations. In each analysis, numerous portfolio and economic assumptions are made.        Accrued Taxes.  Management estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities. Income taxes are discussed in more detail in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities.

This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3,  Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) . This statement changes the current practice of accounting for these transactions by changing the timing of the recognition of exit or disposal costs and generally requires such costs to be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than on the date the entity commits to a plan of exit or disposal. It also requires such liabilities to be measured at fair value. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In managements opinion, the Company and the Bank are currently in compliance with all applicable provisions of this pronouncement (See Note 5 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements).       In October 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 147,  Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions , an amendment of FASB Statement No. 72 and 144 and FASB Interpretation No. 9 (SFAS 147). This statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the acquisition of all or part of a financial institution, except for a transaction between two or more mutual enterprises. This statement removes acquisitions of financial institutions, other than transactions between two or more mutual enterprises, from the scope of FASB No. 72,  Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of Banking or Thrift Institutions , and FASB Interpretation No. 9,  Applying APB Opinions No. 16 and 17, When a Savings and Loan Association or a Similar Institution Is Acquired in a Business Combination Accounting for by the Purchase Method . This statement also provides guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of acquired long-term customer-relationship intangible assets (such as depositor and borrower relationship intangible assets and credit cardholder intangible assets) including those acquired in transactions between two or more mutual enterprises. In managements opinion, the Company and the Bank are currently in compliance with all applicable provisions of this pronouncement.       In December 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  (SFAS 148). This statement amends SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , to provide alternative methods of transaction for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation. Finally this statement amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting  (APB 28), to require disclosure about effects in interim financial information.       Certain of the amendments to SFAS 123 contained in SFAS 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, and others are effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Management is currently considering the impact of the change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation in the 2003 financial statements. In managements opinion, the Company and the Bank are currently in compliance with all applicable disclosure provisions of this pronouncement.  ITEM 7A .
