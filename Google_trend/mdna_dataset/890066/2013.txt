Total interest income decreased from $17,131,965 in 2011 to $15,817,230 in 2012, a 7.68% decrease.  Interest expense for 2012 totaled $3,255,096, an 11.61% decrease from $3,682,580 in 2011.  Net income in 2012 was   $2,665,080   comparedto $2,993,093 in 2011.   The decrease in net income was primarily due to the reduction ininterest income on loans and U.S. Government agency securities offset by a reduction in interest expense on deposits and a reductionin the provision for loan losses.      Inspite of the continued lackluster performance of the economy in general, and the continued low interest rate environment due tocontinued Federal Reserve stimulus, our continued conservative lending decisions led to a substantial increase in outstanding loansand continued improvement in asset quality as reflected in our Total Impaired Loans, which declined from $10,876,258 in 2011 to$7,398,293 in 2012.     Comparison of Results of Operationsfor the Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010     General.  Forthe year ended December 31, 2012, the Company reported consolidated net income of $2,665,080 ($0.98   basic and diluted earningsper share) compared to consolidated net income of $2,993,093 ($1.10 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December31, 2011 and consolidated net income of $2,064,785 ($0.76 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31,2010. The decrease in the 2012 consolidated net income was mainly due to decreases in interest income on U.S. Government agencysecurities, loan income, and gains on investment securities. These decreases were partially offset by decreases in interest expenseon deposits, other expenses and provision for loan losses, while employee benefits slightly increased. The increase in the 2011consolidated net income was mainly due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits and a decrease in provision for loan losses.This was partially offset by a decrease in loan and U.S. Government agency securities income and an increase in income taxes.      Net Interest Income. The primary component of the Company’s net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earnedon assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets. Net interest income is determinedby the spread between the yields earned on the Company’s interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilitiesas well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets,represents the Company’s net interest margin.     Net interest incomeis affected by the mix of loans in the Bank’s loan portfolio. Currently a majority of the Bank’s loans are residentialand commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate and indirect automobile loans secured by automobiles.     In 2012, the Bank continueda strategy of reducing its portfolio of above market rate time deposits and other savings products and continuing to focus on theaccumulation and retention of core deposits by offering rates appropriate for our marketplace. As a result of these efforts, theBank realized an increase in the balances of low volatility deposits and a further decrease in interest paid on deposits.      20         Consolidated net interestincome for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $12,562,134 compared to $13,449,385 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $12,880,012for the year ended December 31, 2010. The   $887,251   decrease for the most recent year was primarily due to decreasesin most areas of interest income, except for state and municipal securities and other income, partially offset by a decrease ininterest expense on deposits. The $569,373 increase for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to decreases in most areas of interestincome, except for state and municipal securities, offset by greater decreases in interest expense (especially junior subordinateddebentures). The interest income, net of tax, for 2012 was $13,282,000, a $1,012,000 or 7.08%   decrease from the after taxnet interest income for 2011, which was $14,294,000, a $675,406 or 4.96% increase from the after tax net interest income for 2010.     Interest expense decreasedfrom $3,682,580 in 2011 to $3,255,096 in 2012, a $427,484 or a 11.61% decrease, primarily due to a decrease in deposit expense.Interest expense decreased from $5,298,955 in 2010 to $3,682,580 in 2011, a $1,616,375 or a 30.50% decrease, primarily due to adecrease in deposit expense, long-term borrowings (due to the repayment of the $7 million Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta loanin September 2010), and the repayment in 2010 of the junior subordinated debentures. Net interest margin for the year ended December31, 2012 was 3.98% compared to 4.39% and 4.05% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.      21         The following tableallocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilitiesfor the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume.

The incremental tax rate applied was37.11% for 2012 and 25.64 %  for 2011.  2 Non-accrual loans included in average balance.     Provision for CreditLosses.  During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company made a provision of $250,000 for credit losses, compared to aprovision of $663,000 and $1,050,000 for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decreasein 2012 was primarily due to many of the delinquent commercial real estate loans already having specific loan loss provisions.At December 31, 2012, the allowance for credit losses equaled 58.84% of non-accrual and past due loans compared to 77.38% and 48.69%at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $873,000compared to $132,000 and $1,223,000 in net charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.      23         Other Income. Other income includes service charges on deposit accounts, other fees and commissions, net gains on investment securities, andincome on Bank owned life insurance (BOLI). Other income   decreased from $2,089,530 in 2011 to $1,822,072 in 2012, a $267,458,or 12.80% decrease. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in gains on securities with a lesser decrease in service chargeson deposit accounts. Other income   increased from $1,898,607 in 2010 to $2,089,530 in 2011, a $190,923, or 10.06% increase.The increase was primarily due to an increase in gains on securities.     Other Expenses.  Other expenses, which consist of non-interest operating expenses, decreased from $11,115,412 in 2011 to $10,795,319 in 2012,a $320,093 or 2.88% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other expenses (included in this decrease in otherexpenses is the decrease in the FDIC Assessment as discussed on page 3 of this Report under  Economic and Credit Turmoil from2009 to 2012 ) and impairment on securities, partially offset by an increase in employee benefits.       Other expensesdecreased from $11,178,323 in 2010 to $11,115,412 in 2011, a $62,911 or 0.57% decrease.   This decrease was primarily dueto a decrease in employee benefits and impairment on securities offset by increases in salaries and wages and other expenses (primarilyFDIC Assessments and legal expenses).     Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $673,807, compared to an income tax expenseof $767,410 for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was due to the increase in tax exempt income earned on state andmunicipal securities and a decrease in net interest income. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded an incometax expense of $767,410, compared to an income tax expense of $485,511 for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase wasdue to a lesser amount contributed to provision for credit losses in 2011 and an increase in net interest income.     Comparison of Financial Conditionat December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010     The Company’stotal assets increased to $387,438,269 at December 31, 2012 from $365,260,263 at December 31, 2011. The Company’s total assetsincreased to $365,260,263 at December 31, 2011 from $347,067,276 at December 31, 2010.     The Company’snet loan portfolio increased to $249,631,525 at December 31, 2012 compared to $232,734,257 at December 31, 2011 and $229,850,888at December 31, 2010. The increase in the loan portfolio during the 2012 period was primarily due to increases in indirect loans,commercial and industrial mortgages, home equity and purchase money mortgages, partially offset by decreases in refinance mortgageloans, construction loans for commercial and industrial loans and demand secured business loans. In 2012, mortgage participationspurchased also decreased. The increase in the loan portfolio during the 2011 period is primarily due to an increase in indirectautomobile loans, residential mortgages, and installment loans. They were partially offset by decreases in commercial mortgages.     During 2012, the Company’stotal investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investment securities held tomaturity) totaled $100,490,267, a $2,376,288 or 2.31%, decrease from $102,866,555 at December 31, 2011. This decrease is primarilyattributable to an decrease in mortgage backed securities, partially offset by an increase in Non-MD municipals .   During2011, the Company’s total investment securities portfolio (including both investment securities available for sale and investmentsecurities held to maturity) totaled $102,866,555, a $15,598,196 or 17.88%, increase from $87,268,359 at December 31, 2010.  This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage backed securities, Government agency CMO’s and Non-MDmunicipals. These were partially offset by decreases in U.S. Government agencies and corporate trust preferred.     Depositsas of December 31, 2012 totaled $332,288,886, an increase of $20,344,225, or 6.53%, from the $311,944,661 total as of December31, 2011. Deposits as of December 31, 2011 totaled $311,944,661, an increase of $17,499,833, or 5.95%, from the $294,444,828 totalas of December 31, 2010. Demand deposits as of December 31, 2012 totaled $84,288,485, a $10,949,022, or 14.93%, increase from $73,339,463at December 31, 2011. NOW and Super NOW accounts, as of December 31, 2012, increased by $7,660,678, or 31.87% from their 2011 levelto $31,699,734. Money market accounts increased by $2,650,758, or 14.66%, from their 2011 level, to total $20,734,875 at December31, 2012. Savings deposits increased by $8,386,393, or 13.91%, from their 2011 level, to $68,677,080 at December 31, 2012. Timedeposits over $100,000 totaled $46,549,144 on December 31, 2012, a decrease of $1,457,228, or 3.04% from December 31, 2011. Othertime deposits (made up of certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and individual retirement accounts) totaled $80,339,568 onDecember 31, 2012, a $7,844,136 or 8.90% decrease from December 31, 2011.      24         Total stockholders’equity as of December 31, 2012 increased by $2,376,835, or 7.62%, from the 2011 period. The increase was attributed to an increasein earnings less the cash dividends paid, net of dividends reinvested and the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income.Total stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2011 increased by $4,878,184, or 18.53%, from the 2010 period. The increasewas attributed to an increase in earnings less the cash dividends paid, net of dividends reinvested and the increase in accumulatedother comprehensive income.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     Off-Balance SheetArrangements.  The Bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs ofits customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, tovarying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.     Loan commitments andlines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts. Loan commitmentsgenerally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts, fixed expiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Linesof credit generally have variable interest rates. Many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire withoutbeing drawn upon; accordingly, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluateseach customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral or other security obtained, if deemednecessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but mayinclude deposits held in financial institutions, U.S. Treasury securities, other marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory,property and equipment, personal residences, income-producing commercial properties, and land under development. Personal guaranteesare also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments.     Letters of credit areconditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarilyissued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuingletters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds collateraland obtains personal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary.     The Bank’s exposureto credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment. Loan commitments, linesof credit, and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including collateral, as outstanding loans. As of December 31, 2012,the Bank has accrued $200,000 for unfunded commitments related to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, whichis included in other liabilities.     Market Risk Management     Market risk is therisk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchangerates or equity pricing. The Company’s principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from its lending, investingand deposit taking activities. The Company’s profitability is dependent on the Bank’s net interest income. Interestrate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at differentintervals than interest earning assets. The Bank’s Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee oversees the managementof interest rate risk. The primary purpose of the committee is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changesdue to interest rate fluctuations. The Company does not utilize derivative financial or commodity instruments or hedging strategiesin its management of interest rate risk. The primary tool used by the committee to monitor interest rate risk is a “gap”report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities subjectto repricing within a given time period. These efforts affect the loan pricing and deposit rate policies of the Company as wellas the asset mix, volume guidelines, and liquidity and capital planning.      25         The following tablesets forth the Bank’s interest-rate sensitivity at December 31, 2012.                          Over 1                               Over 3 to      Through      Over                 0-3 Months      12 Months      5 Years      5 Years      Total          (Dollars in Thousands)     Assets:                                                Cash and due from banks    $ -      $ -      $ -      $ -      $ 15,959     Federal funds and overnight deposits      2,669        -        -        -        2,669     Securities      -        126        -        100,364        100,490     Loans      13,602        10,074        66,275        159,680        249,631     Fixed assets      -        -        -        -        3,873     Other assets      -        -        -        -        14,816                                                      Total assets    $ 16,271      $ 10,200      $ 66,275      $ 260,044      $ 387,438                                                      Liabilities:                                                Demand deposit accounts    $ -      $ -      $ -      $ -      $ 84,288     NOW accounts      31,700        -        -        -        31,700     Money market deposit accounts      20,735        -        -        -        20,735     Savings accounts      68,516        161        -        -        68,677     IRA accounts      3,791        16,631        21,785        1,074        43,281     Certificates of deposit      13,233        34,152        35,716        507        83,608     Long-term borrowings      -        -        -        20,000        20,000     Other liabilities      -        -        -        -        1,561     Stockholders’ equity:      -        -        -        -        33,588                                                      Total liabilities and stockholders' equity    $ 137,975      $ 50,944      $ 57,501      $ 21,581      $ 387,438                                                      GAP    $ (121,704 )    $ (40,744 )    $ 8,774      $ 238,463              Cumulative GAP    $ (121,704 )    $ (162,448 )    $ (153,674 )    $ 84,789              Cumulative GAP as a % of total assets      -31.41 %      -41.93 %      -39.66 %      21.88 %               The foregoing analysisassumes that the Bank’s assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity.Mortgage backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed thatloans and other securities are not called prior to maturity. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts are presumed to reprice atmaturity. NOW savings accounts are assumed to reprice at within three months although it is the Company’s experience thatsuch accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates.     In addition to gapanalysis, the Bank utilizes a simulation model to quantify the effect a hypothetical immediate plus or minus 200 basis point changein rates would have on net interest income and the economic value of equity. The model takes into consideration the effect of callfeatures of investments as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates. When actual changes in interest rates occur,the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model and,in the Bank’s experience, the changes historically realized have been narrower than those projected by the model. However,the Bank believes that the model is a prudent forecasting tool. As of December 31, 2012, the model produced the following sensitivityprofile for net interest income and the economic value of equity.         26                 Immediate Change in Rates          -200      -100      +100      +200          Basis Points      Basis Points      Basis Points      Basis Points                                     % Change in Net Interest Income      -8.8 %      -6.3 %      1.5 %      1.1 %   % Change in Economic Value of Equity      -19.3 %      -13.3 %      1.8 %      -5.1 %      Liquidity and Capital Resources     The Company currentlyhas no business other than that of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments. The Company’s principalsources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictionson the payment of dividends.     The Bank’s principalsources of funds for investments and operations are net income, deposits from its primary market area, principal and interest paymentson loans, interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities. Its principal funding commitmentsare for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits. Deposits are considered the primary source offunds supporting the Bank’s lending and investment activities. The Bank also uses borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta tosupplement deposits, residential and small business lending, and to meet specific and anticipated needs.     The Bank’s mostliquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, federal funds soldand money market mutual funds. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank’s operating financing and investment activitiesat any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated futuredeposit flows.     Cash and cash equivalents(cash due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold), as of December 31, 2012,totaled $18,628,582, an increase of $8,674,992 or 87.15%, from the December 31, 2011 total of $9,953,590. This increase was dueto the sales of mortgage backed securities and deposits that were not used for making loans.     As of December 31,2012, the Bank was permitted to draw on a $54.69 million line of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta. Borrowings under the line aresecured by a floating lien on the Bank’s residential mortgage loans and its portfolio of U.S. Government and agency securities.As of December 31, 2012, there was nothing outstanding under the daily rate credit. There was also a $10 million convertible advance(callable monthly and with a final maturity of November 1, 2017.)   There was a $5 million convertible advance settled July21, 2008 with a final maturity of July 23, 2018. This advance has a 2.73% rate of interest and was callable quarterly, startingJuly 23, 2009. There was a $5 million convertible advance taken out August 22, 2008 which has a final maturity of August 22, 2018.This advance has a 3.34% rate of interest and is callable quarterly, starting August 22, 2011.    In addition, the Bank hasan unsecured line of credit totaling $3 million from a commercial bank and a $5 million unsecured line of credit from a financialbank, on which there is no outstanding balances at December 31, 2012.     Federal banking regulationsrequire the Company and the Bank to maintain specified levels of capital. At December 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance withthese requirements with a leverage ratio of 8.26%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.82% and total risk-based capital ratioof 14.07%. At December 31, 2012, the Bank met the criteria for designation as a well capitalized depository institution under FDICregulations.     Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices     The consolidated financialstatements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, whichrequire the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changesin the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company’sassets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company’s performancethan do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the sameextent as the prices of goods and services.      27         Critical Accounting Policies     The Company’saccounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, starting on pageF-8 and are essential to understanding Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.As discussed there, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in theU.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financialstatements and accompanying notes. Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the determinationof estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessaryto value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to bereasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to thefinancial statements. The Company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change. Historically, actual results havenot differed significantly from the Company’s estimates. The following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimatesand principles involved in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, including the identification of the variablesmost important in the estimation process:     Allowance for CreditLosses.  The Bank’s allowance for credit losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actualevents occur, including historical losses as an indicator of future losses, fair market value of collateral, and various generalor industry or geographic specific economic events.  The use of these estimates and values is inherently subjective and theactual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.  For further information regarding our allowance for credit losses,see “Allowance for Credit Losses” under Item 1- “Business” of this Annual Report.     Accrued Taxes. Management estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities. Income taxes are discussedin more detail in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or tobe received from taxing authorities. In estimating accrued taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriatetax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company’stax position.     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements     The FASB has issuedseveral exposure drafts which, if adopted, would significantly alter the Company’s (and all other financial institutions’)method of accounting for, and reporting, its financial assets and some liabilities from a historical cost method to a fair valuemethod of accounting as well as the reported amount of net interest income. Also, the FASB has issued an exposure draft regardinga change in the accounting for leases. Under this exposure draft, the total amount of “lease rights” and total amountof future payments required under all leases would be reflected on the balance sheets of all entities as assets and debt. If thechanges under discussion in either of these exposure drafts are adopted, the financial statements of the Company could be materiallyimpacted as to the amounts of recorded assets, liabilities, capital, net interest income, interest expense, depreciation expense,rent expense and net income. The Company has not determined the extent of the possible changes at this time. The exposure draftsare in different stages of review, approval and possible adoption.     In April 2011, theFASB issued ASU No. 2011-02, Receivable (Topic 310),  A Creditor’s Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a TroubledDebt Restructuring . The main objective of the ASU is to clarify a creditor’s evaluation of whether in modifying a loan,it has granted a concession in circumstances that qualify the loan as a Troubled Debt Restructured (TDR) loan. These loans aresubject to various accounting and disclosure requirements. The ASU was effective for the first interim or annual period beginningon or after June 15, 2011, and was applied retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period of adoption. Certain disclosuresare required for loans considered as TDR loans resulting from the application of the ASU that were not considered TDR under priorguidance. The Company’s compliance with ASU No. 2011-02 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidatedfinancial statements.     ASU No. 2011-03,“Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860) – Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements.”  ASU 2011-03is intended to improve financial reporting of repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferorto repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity. ASU 2011-03 removes from the assessment of effective control(i) the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantiallythe agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and (ii) the collateral maintenance guidance related tothat criterion. ASU 2011-03 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2012 and did not have a significant impacton the Corporation’s financial statements.      28         In May 2011, the FASBissued ASU No. 2011-04,  Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820),   Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and DisclosureRequirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs . The main objective of the ASU is to conform the requirements for measuring fair valueand the disclosure information under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial ReportingStandards (IFRS). The amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair valueand for the disclosure about fair value measurements. Other amendments clarify existing requirements and change particular principlesor requirements for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements. The ASU was effective for thefirst interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011, early application for public entities is not permitted.The Company’s compliance with ASU No. 2011-04 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financialstatements.     InJune 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05,  Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):    Presentation of ComprehensiveIncome.   The amendments in this Update improve the comparability, clarity, consistency, and transparency of financialreporting and increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income.  To increase the prominence ofitems reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of U.S. GAAP and IFRS, the option to present componentsof other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity was eliminated.  Theamendments require that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statementof comprehensive.     InDecember 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-10,  Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360):  Derecognition of inSubstance Real Estate-a Scope Clarification.   The amendments in this Update affect entities that cease to have a controllingfinancial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary's nonrecourse debt.Under the amendments in this Update, when a parent (reporting entity) ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiarythat is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary's nonrecourse debt, the reporting entity should applythe guidance in Subtopic 360-20 to determine whether it should derecognize the in substance real estate. Generally, a reportingentity would not satisfy the requirements to derecognize the in substance real estate before the legal transfer of the real estateto the lender and the extinguishment of the related nonrecourse indebtedness.  That is, even if the reporting entityceases to have a controlling financial interest under Subtopic 810-10, the reporting entity would continue to include thereal estate, debt, and the results of the subsidiary's operations in its consolidated financial statements until legal title tothe real estate is transferred to legally satisfy the debt.  The amendments in this Update should be applied on a prospectivebasis to deconsolidation events occurring after the effective date.  Prior periods should not be adjusted even if thereporting entity has continuing involvement with previously derecognized in substance real estate entities.  For publicentities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on orafter June 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted.  This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’sfinancial statements.     ASU 2011-11, “BalanceSheet (Topic 210) – “Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.”  ASU 2011-11 amends Topic210, “Balance Sheet,” to require an entity to disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments,such as sales and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing/lending arrangements,and derivative instruments that are eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and/or subject to a master nettingarrangement or similar agreement. ASU 2011-11 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2013, andis not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.     InDecember 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12,  Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):  Deferral of the Effective Datefor Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting StandardsUpdate No. 2011-05 .  In order to defer only those changes in Update 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassificationadjustments, the paragraphs in this Update supersede certain pending paragraphs in Update 2011-05.  Entities should continueto report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effectbefore Update 2011-05.  All other requirements in Update 2011-05 are not affected by this Update, including the requirementto report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements.Public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2011. The Company has provided the necessary disclosure in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.      29         ASU 2012-02“Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) – Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.”  ASU 2012-02give entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leadsto a determination that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing thetotality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible assetis impaired, then the entity must perform the quantitative impairment test. If, under the quantitative impairment test, the carryingamount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an entity should recognize an impairment loss in the amount of that excess.Permitting an entity to assess qualitative factors when testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment results in guidancethat is similar to the goodwill impairment testing guidance in ASU 2011-08. ASU 2012-02 is effective for the Corporation beginningJanuary 1, 2013 (early adoption permitted) and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Corporation’s financialstatements.       ITEM 8 .
