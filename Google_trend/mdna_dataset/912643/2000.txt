The worldwide market for computing solutions continues to expand. The availability of high-powered portable computer technology coupled with application specific technologies and the proliferation of wireless communications contributes to the increased demand. The Company expects increased requirements to improve the efficiency in field based work forces and link field workers into corporate information systems.                                         10        The Company targets markets which require portable computing platforms that can perform multiple functions including diagnostics, data acquisition and electronic testing, communication and monitoring. Specifically, the Company is targeting Trucking, Public Services, including Utilities and Public Safety, Heavy Equipment and Field Technologies including Military. Each of these vertical markets continues to experience growth in field service solutions requirements.   COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED JANUARY 2, 2000 AND JANUARY 3, 1999  Net Sales. Net sales for 1999 were $25.3 million, an increase of $5.3 million or 27% from 1998 net sales of $20.0 million. The increase in sales was attributable to professional services and solutions revenue and the introduction of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server product. The increase was also due to significant customer contracts for the 5000 Series Service Bay Tool, offset by a decrease in sales of the 7000 Series Workstation. The decrease is due to customers delaying purchases in anticipation of the 8000 Series product, a technologically enhanced and updated product replacing the 7000 Series Workstation. Unit volumes of the 5000 Series increased from 38% in 1998 to 42% in 1999 due to significant sales of the Service Bay Tool in both the trucking and heavy equipment markets. Unit volumes of the 7000 Series decreased from 62% in 1998 to 39% in 1999. Sales of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server represented 19% of total units in 1999. Production of the 2000 Series began in mid-1999 and, therefore, there were no comparable sales in 1998. Professional services revenue accounted for $3.3 million, or 13% of net sales, in 1999. Professional services revenue was not significant in 1998.       International sales decreased from $5.6 million, or 28% of net sales for 1998, to $3.7 million, or 14% of net sales in 1999. The reduction is due to the delayed introduction of the 8000 Series Workstation. The majority of international sales are in Europe, including $2.8 million in 1999 and $4.0 million in 1998. The Company believes that international sales as a percentage of net sales for the year 2000 will be in the mid-teen to 20% range with little impact on the Company's results of operations and liquidity.       The Company expects sales growth in the year 2000 due to expansion of its solutions and professional services offerings, increased penetration of key vertical markets, introduction of the 8000 Series Workstation and expanded sales of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server introduced in 1999. The Company is targeting sales in trucking, heavy equipment, public services and field technologies and has aligned its sales and marketing efforts to focus on these markets. The 8000 Series Workstation is anticipated to be in full production in the second quarter of 2000. The 8000 Series, the successor of the 7000 Series, is an updated and technologically enhanced product. Additionally, management believes that providing customer specific solutions, including hardware, software, consultation, business needs assessment, training and software integration, will increase future sales opportunities.       Delays in the introduction of the 8000 Series Workstation and/or increased costs due to delays in outsourcing implementation could reduce the Company's projected 2000 sales or increase product costs. In addition, the Company expects revenue growth to fluctuate due to potentially long customer sales cycles.                                         11   Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $1.6 million from $5.8 million in 1998 to $7.4 million in 1999. Gross profit margins, as a percentage of net sales, remained consistent at 29%. Gross profit was negatively impacted by a $1.0 million write down of inventory in the second quarter of 1998. This write down related to excess and obsolete inventory due to product changes in response to technological developments and market needs. In 1999, gross margin was negatively impacted by high volume customer contracts, which include volume discounts, and start-up costs associated with the introduction of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server. Additionally, gross margin was negatively impacted by disposition of previously identified obsolete inventory during 1999, for which recovery on disposition was less than anticipated. The Company's gross profit margin will fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including mix of products sold, inventory obsolescence, the proportion of international sales, large customer contracts (with the associated volume discounts) and outsourcing expenses.       The Company has partnered with contract manufacturers for outsourcing of certain manufacturing activities and expects complete implementation in the first quarter of 2000. The Company will initially outsource the final assembly process with the intent of improving design for manufacturability. Final integration work will remain at the Company, as deemed appropriate. The Company anticipates outsourcing will moderately reduce future materials costs, inventory write-offs and certain other operating expenses. Additionally, the Company has initiated re-design efforts to reduce product costs and incorporate embedded systems. The Company believes gross profit margins should be in the low 30% range in the near future with additional improvement upon completion of the re-design efforts.  Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, incentive compensation, commissions, travel, trade shows, technical support and professional services personnel and general advertising and promotion. These expenses also include the labor and material costs related to maintaining the Company's standard one-year warranty program. Sales and marketing expenses were $5.6 million in 1999, an increase of $0.1 million as compared to $5.5 million in 1998. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses decreased from 27% in 1998 to 22% in 1999. The increase in expenses was primarily due to expansion of the sales force including establishing the professional services group. The Company intends to continue expanding its sales force and resale channels primarily through expanding its value-added reseller program as well as moderately increasing its advertising and promotion costs within its target markets. The Company anticipates growth of sales and marketing expenses to be less than the growth of sales in the future.  General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include the Company's executive, finance, information services and human resources departments. These expenses increased slightly from $2.9 million in 1998 to $3.0 million in 1999. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses decreased from 15% in 1998 to 12% in 1999. The Company anticipates continuing to hold the growth of general and administrative expenses relatively constant and to remain at a level less than the growth of sales in the near future.                                         12   Research and Development. Research and development expenses are incurred in the design, development and testing of new or enhanced products, services and customized computing platforms. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses increased from $3.2 million in 1998 to $3.4 million in 1999. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses decreased from 16% in 1998 to 13% in 1999. The increase was primarily due to the development of new products, including the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server and 8000 Series Workstation, and engineering support of customer-specific applications including the Company's Service Bay Tool. The Company expects research and development expenses to increase in the future due to completion of the 8000 Series Workstation and re-design efforts that are expected to result in product cost reductions. Research and development expenses are anticipated to remain consistent as a percentage of net sales in the near future to support expanded products, software integration and engineering support, and solutions offerings.  Product Upgrade and Restructuring Costs. Product upgrade and restructuring costs were $1.5 million, or 8% of net sales, in 1998 as compared to $0.4 million, or 2% of net sales in 1999. In 1999, these costs were due to severance charges from reorganization efforts related to outsourcing the manufacturing and design of products. In 1998, these costs related to the discontinuation of the 5000 Series I, as well as other expenses relating to restructuring and severance costs.  Interest Expense and Other, Net. Net interest income of $158,000 was recorded in 1998 as compared to net interest expense of $314,000 in 1999. The increase in interest expense is due to borrowings on the Company's line of credit and interest payments to subordinated noteholders. The Company anticipates continued interest expense from its line of credit, interest payments on notes, and amortization of financing costs of warrants related to the subordinated note issuance. The Company anticipates recording net interest expense for the foreseeable future.  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED JANUARY 3, 1999 AND JANUARY 4, 1998  Net Sales. Net sales for 1998 were $20.0 million, a decrease of $3.8 million or 16% from 1997 net sales of $23.8 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to factors relating to the 5000 Series product. During mid-1998, the 5000 Series II product was released, which provided technology upgrades, lower pricing and improved performance and reliability. Sales of the 5000 Series products represented 38% and 46% of net sales, or $7.6 million and $10.9 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively. Sales of the 7000 Series product were comparable in 1998 and 1997. International sales decreased slightly to $5.6 million, or 28% of net sales for 1998, from $6.0 million, or 25% of net sales in 1997.  Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased $3.4 million from $9.2 million, or 39% of net sales in 1997, to $5.8 million, or 29% of net sales in 1998. The decrease was the result of the impact of fixed manufacturing costs allocated over reduced production volume in 1998 and a $1.0 million write down of inventory in the second quarter of 1998. During 1998, certain warranty-related costs were reclassified from cost of sales to sales and marketing expense. The impact increased gross profit by $458,000, or 2% of net sales in 1998 and by $774,500, or 3% of net sales in 1997.                                         13   Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses were $5.5 million, or 27% of net sales in 1998, as compared to $5.0 million, or 21% of net sales in 1997. The increase was primarily due to expansion of the sales force including the addition of the professional services group.  General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased slightly from $3.0 million in 1997 to $2.9 million in 1998. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses increased from 13% in 1997 to 15% in 1998.  Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased from $1.9 million or 8% of net sales in 1997 to $3.2 million or 16% of net sales in 1998. The increase was primarily attributable to the introduction of the 5000 Series II product and development of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server.  Interest Expense and Other, Net. Net interest income of $158,000 was recorded in 1998 as compared to net interest expense of $258,000 in 1997. Proceeds from the initial public offering were used to repay debt in March and April of 1997, with interest income earned on remaining proceeds for the rest of the year.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       On February 22, 2000, the Company completed a $4.25 million equity investment by Industrial-Works Holding Co., LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Glenmount International L.P. In exchange for the $4.25 million investment, the Company issued 4,250,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (each share of which is initially convertible into one share of Common Stock). Industrial-Works Holding Co., LLC, also received 500,000 common stock warrants exercisable at $1.00 per share. The transaction was approved at a special shareholders' meeting on February 7, 2000. The Company intends to use the net proceeds for market expansion and new product development as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.       In September 1999, the Company completed a private placement of $3.0 million in subordinated notes. The notes bear interest at 11% per annum and mature in September 2001. Noteholders also received warrants to purchase 1.5 million shares of common stock exercisable at $1.00 per share. The warrants are exercisable for five years, and were recorded at their estimated fair value of $882,000 at the date of issuance.        In November 1998, the Company entered into a two-year $3.0 million line of credit agreement. Borrowings bear interest at the greater of 4% over prime or 9%. The interest rate changed from 3% over prime to 4% over prime in the third quarter of 1999 due to default on the Company's profitability covenant. The line of credit balance was $1.8 million as of January 2, 2000, and $0.7 million at January 3, 1999. The borrowing base consists of 75% of eligible receivables plus the lesser of $600,000 or 30% of eligible inventories as defined in the agreement. Availability based on the borrowing base calculation, including accounts receivable and inventories, was $3.0 million as of January 2, 2000, and $1.7 million, including only accounts receivable, as of January 3, 1999. The agreement contains a covenant requiring cumulative year-to-date profit on a quarterly basis. The Company was out of compliance with the covenant as of January 2, 2000, and has received a written waiver of default. Failure to comply with this covenant in the future could result in default and accelerated repayment requirements. The Company intends to renew this agreement upon expiration or pursue a replacement source of financing. However, there can be no assurances that a credit agreement will be available to the Company.                                         14        The Company's cash balance as of January 2, 2000 was $0.1 million as compared to the January 3, 1999 balance of $1.7 million. Cash used for operating activities totaled $5.2 million in 1999 and $1.2 million in 1998. The Company's accounts receivable increased from $3.9 million at January 3, 1999 to $5.1 million at January 2, 2000. The increase in accounts receivable was due to the timing of shipments at year-end. Net inventories increased from $3.4 million at January 3, 1999 to $4.5 million at January 2, 2000. This increase was due to purchases for anticipated sales and expansion of the Company's product offerings with introduction of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server. Deferred revenue increased from $0.8 million at January 3, 1999 to $1.0 million at January 2, 2000, attributable to the sales of extended warranties. Prepaid expenses increased from $0.1 million at January 3, 1999 to $0.5 million at January 2, 2000, due to prepaid deposits related to long lead time purchases with an outsourcing contract manufacturer. Accounts payable increased from $1.8 million at January 3, 1999 to $3.8 million at January 2, 2000. The increase was due to purchasing inventory for customer orders in the fourth quarter of 1999 and anticipated sales in the first quarter of 2000. Accrued liabilities increased from $0.3 million at January 3, 1999 to $0.5 million at January 2, 2000, due to timing of payments at year end.       The Company purchased $0.6 million of property, plant and equipment in 1999 as compared to $1.1 million in 1998. The 1999 expenditures related primarily to tooling expenditures for the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server and 8000 Series Workstation. The Company anticipates purchases of property, plant and equipment in 2000 will remain consistent with 1999.       The Company is currently pursuing alternative equity sources to demonstrate sustained compliance with the Nasdaq National Market minimum net tangible asset listing requirements and to provide additional cash for operating activities. The Company currently anticipates that the proceeds from its February 2000 preferred stock issuance, together with line of credit availability, and anticipated operating cash flows and proceeds from the alternative equity sources it is pursuing, should be sufficient to fund its cash flow needs in 2000. Cash requirements for future periods depend on a number of factors including the demand for the Company's products, profitability, cash management operations, growth rate and acquisition strategies, among other factors. There can be no assurances that additional financing will be available at all or that it, if available, will be obtainable on terms favorable to the Company and would not be dilutive to existing shareholders.  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE       The Company did not experience any significant business related interruptions with its products, its internal computer systems and non-computer operations, its production processes, key vendors, vital business partners or critical customers. The Company is continuing to monitor potential problems, but does not expect any major impact during the year. The cost of the Year 2000 initiatives was approximately $150,000, and was expensed as incurred. The Company is not aware of any residual Year 2000 risks; however, there can be no assurance that such issues do not exist.                                        15   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under the Company's line of credit agreement. The line of credit bears interest based on the Prime Lending Rate. At January 2, 2000, the Company had $1.8 million outstanding. Based on analysis, interest rate shifts would have an immaterial impact on the Company.       The Company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in its cash and cash equivalents. The Company invests any excess cash and cash equivalents in money market instruments. The Company had $0.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at January 2, 2000. Based on analysis, shifts in money market rates would have an immaterial impact on the Company.       All of the Company's transactions are conducted and accounts are denominated in United States dollars and as such, the Company does not currently have exposure to foreign currency risk.  ITEM 8.
